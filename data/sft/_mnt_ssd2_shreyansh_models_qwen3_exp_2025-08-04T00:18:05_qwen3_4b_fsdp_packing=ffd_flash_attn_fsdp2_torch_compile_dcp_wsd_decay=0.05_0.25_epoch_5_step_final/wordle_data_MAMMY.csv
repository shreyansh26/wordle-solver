For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it likely to reveal at least one correct letter or eliminate several letters that aren't in the word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, etc.) and other vowels (I, O, U).

I want a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Uses new consonants (avoid S, L, T).
3. Uses new vowels if possible.

A strong candidate is ""RADIO"":
- R, D, I, O are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2.
- It’s a common word and covers new letters efficiently.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - Letters not in the word: R, D, I, O (in addition to S, L, T, E)
   - Letter A is confirmed in position 2.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ A _ _ _
- Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O
- Allowed letters (among common ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except the forbidden ones
- Has A in position 2
- Uses only allowed letters

Good candidates:
- C A _ _ _ (e.g., CAVES, but E is forbidden)
- F A _ _ _
- M A _ _ _
- N A _ _ _
- P A _ _ _
- B A _ _ _

Let's pick a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern. ""MANLY"" is invalid because Y is allowed but L is forbidden. ""CANDY"" is invalid because D and Y might be okay, but D is forbidden. ""BANAL"" is invalid because B, A, N, A, L - L is forbidden.

Looking at the allowed letters, ""C"" and ""N"" are still available. ""CANTO"" is invalid because O is forbidden. ""CANAL"" is invalid because L is forbidden. ""CAMPS"" is invalid because S is forbidden.

""MAPLE"" is invalid because P, A, M, L, E - L and E are forbidden. ""MANLY"" - L is forbidden. ""MANGO"" - O is forbidden.

""JAMES"" - S is forbidden. ""HANKY"" - K is allowed, Y is allowed, but H, A, N, K, Y - all letters are allowed except we need to check the forbidden list. Forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. H, A, N, K, Y - none are forbidden. This seems valid.

But ""HANKY"" is 5 letters, A is in position 2. This seems to fit.

Another option: ""MAMMA"" - but M, A, M, M, A - all letters allowed, but A is in position 2. This is valid, but might be less common.

""JAMMY"" - J, A, M, M, Y - all allowed, A in position 2.

Between these, ""HANKY"" seems more common.

But let me think of a word that uses more distinct letters. ""CANNY"" - C, A, N, N, Y - N is allowed, Y is allowed. This is valid.

""CANNY"" seems like a good choice as it uses C, N, Y which are all allowed, and fits the pattern _ A _ _ _.

Wait, CANNY is C-A-N-N-Y, which has A in position 2, and N is allowed. This seems correct.

But actually, ""CANNY"" has N in positions 3 and 4, which is fine. The forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, N, Y are all allowed.

So, ""CANNY"" is a valid next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""CANTO"" is invalid due to O. ""CANOE"" is invalid due to E and O. ""CAMPS"" invalid due to S. 

""JAMES"" invalid due to S. ""HANKY"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""BANJO"" - but O is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but this is less common. 

""MAPLE"" invalid due to L and E. 

""MANLY"" invalid due to L. 

""MACON"" - M, A, C, O, N - O is forbidden. 

""MANHO"" - O is forbidden. 

""MANLY"" already considered.

""JAMMY"" seems valid. 

Between ""HANKY"" and ""JAMMY"", both are valid. ""HANKY"" might be slightly more common.

But let me think of another word: ""PANIC"" - but I is forbidden. 

""CANON"" - O is forbidden. 

""CAVAL"" - L is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but less common. 

""VAMPS"" - S is forbidden. 

""CAMPS"" - S is forbidden. 

""CANON"" - O is forbidden. 

""CAVIE"" - E is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" seems the only one with U. 

But ""CAVUM"" is C-A-V-U-M, which has A in position 2, and all letters allowed. This uses V and U which haven't been tested yet. This might be a good guess as it tests new letters.

So, ""CAVUM"" seems like a strong next guess as it introduces V and U while keeping A in position 2.

But let me verify: forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, V, U, M - none are forbidden. This is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""CAVUM"".

Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.
- We need a word with A in position 2 and no other forbidden letters.

A valid word that fits is ""CAVUM"" (though less common), or ""HANKY"". Between these, ""CAVUM"" introduces two new letters (V and U) while fitting the constraints.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it likely to reveal at least one correct letter or eliminate several letters that aren't in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, etc.) and other vowels (I, O, U).

I want a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Uses new consonants (avoid S, L, T).
3. Uses new vowels if possible.

A strong candidate is ""RADIO"":
- R, D, I, O are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2.
- It’s a common word and covers new letters efficiently.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - Letters not in the word: R, D, I, O (in addition to S, L, T, E)
   - Letter A is confirmed in position 2.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ A _ _ _
- Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O
- Allowed letters (among common ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except the forbidden ones
- Has A in position 2
- Uses only allowed letters

Good candidates:
- C A _ _ _ (e.g., CAVES, but E is forbidden)
- F A _ _ _
- M A _ _ _
- N A _ _ _
- P A _ _ _
- B A _ _ _

Let's pick a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern. ""MANLY"" is invalid because Y is allowed but L is forbidden. ""CANDY"" is invalid because D and Y might be okay, but D is forbidden. ""BANAL"" is invalid because B, A, N, A, L - L is forbidden.

Looking at the allowed letters, ""C"" and ""N"" are still available. ""CANTO"" is invalid because O is forbidden. ""CANAL"" is invalid because L is forbidden. ""CAMPS"" is invalid because S is forbidden.

""MAPLE"" is invalid because P, A, M, L, E - L and E are forbidden. ""MANLY"" - L is forbidden. ""MANGO"" - O is forbidden.

""JAMES"" - S is forbidden. ""HANKY"" - K is allowed, Y is allowed, but H, A, N, K, Y - all letters are allowed except we need to check the forbidden list. Forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. H, A, N, K, Y - none are forbidden. This seems valid.

But ""HANKY"" is 5 letters, A is in position 2. This seems to fit.

Another option: ""MAMMA"" - but M, A, M, M, A - all letters allowed, but A is in position 2. This is valid, but might be less common.

""JAMMY"" - J, A, M, M, Y - all allowed, A in position 2.

Between these, ""HANKY"" seems more common.

But let me think of a word that uses more distinct letters. ""CANNY"" - C, A, N, N, Y - N is allowed, Y is allowed. This is valid.

""CANNY"" seems like a good choice as it uses C, N, Y which are all allowed, and fits the pattern _ A _ _ _.

Wait, CANNY is C-A-N-N-Y, which has A in position 2, and N is allowed. This seems correct.

But actually, ""CANNY"" has N in positions 3 and 4, which is fine. The forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, N, Y are all allowed.

So, ""CANNY"" is a valid next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""CANTO"" is invalid due to O. ""CANOE"" is invalid due to E and O. ""CAMPS"" invalid due to S. 

""JAMES"" invalid due to S. ""HANKY"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""BANJO"" - but O is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but this is less common. 

""MAPLE"" invalid due to L and E. 

""MANLY"" invalid due to L. 

""MACON"" - M, A, C, O, N - O is forbidden. 

""MANHO"" - O is forbidden. 

""MANLY"" already considered.

""JAMMY"" seems valid. 

Between ""HANKY"" and ""JAMMY"", both are valid. ""HANKY"" might be slightly more common.

But let me think of another word: ""PANIC"" - but I is forbidden. 

""CANON"" - O is forbidden. 

""CAVAL"" - L is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but less common. 

""VAMPS"" - S is forbidden. 

""CAMPS"" - S is forbidden. 

""CANON"" - O is forbidden. 

""CAVIE"" - E is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" seems the only one with U. 

But ""CAVUM"" is C-A-V-U-M, which has A in position 2, and all letters allowed. This uses V and U which haven't been tested yet. This might be a good guess as it tests new letters.

So, ""CAVUM"" seems like a strong next guess as it introduces V and U while keeping A in position 2.

But let me verify: forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, V, U, M - none are forbidden. This is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""CAVUM"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.
- We need a word with A in position 2 and no other forbidden letters.

A valid word that fits is ""CAVUM"" (though less common), or ""HANKY"". Between these, ""CAVUM"" introduces two new letters (V and U) while fitting the constraints.

Current constraints:
1. Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
2. Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, C, V, U
3. M is in the word but not in position 5.

Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- M somewhere except position 5
- Only using the allowed letters

Possible positions for M: 3 or 4

Let's try M in position 3: _ A M _ _
Letters left to fill positions 1, 4, 5 from: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, W, Y, Z

Looking for common words:
- BAMBO → no, 4 letters
- FAMNY → not a word
- HAMAL → not common
- JAMMY → J, A, M, M, Y - but M is allowed in positions 3 and 4, Y is allowed
- KAMIK → not a word
- NAMED → D is forbidden
- PAMPH → not a word
- WAMBY → W, A, M, B, Y - all allowed, M in position 3

""WAMBY"" seems valid:
- W A M B Y

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it likely to reveal at least one correct letter or eliminate several letters that aren't in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, etc.) and other vowels (I, O, U).

I want a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Uses new consonants (avoid S, L, T).
3. Uses new vowels if possible.

A strong candidate is ""RADIO"":
- R, D, I, O are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2.
- It’s a common word and covers new letters efficiently.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - Letters not in the word: R, D, I, O (in addition to S, L, T, E)
   - Letter A is confirmed in position 2.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ A _ _ _
- Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O
- Allowed letters (among common ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except the forbidden ones
- Has A in position 2
- Uses only allowed letters

Good candidates:
- C A _ _ _ (e.g., CAVES, but E is forbidden)
- F A _ _ _
- M A _ _ _
- N A _ _ _
- P A _ _ _
- B A _ _ _

Let's pick a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern. ""MANLY"" is invalid because Y is allowed but L is forbidden. ""CANDY"" is invalid because D and Y might be okay, but D is forbidden. ""BANAL"" is invalid because B, A, N, A, L - L is forbidden.

Looking at the allowed letters, ""C"" and ""N"" are still available. ""CANTO"" is invalid because O is forbidden. ""CANAL"" is invalid because L is forbidden. ""CAMPS"" is invalid because S is forbidden.

""MAPLE"" is invalid because P, A, M, L, E - L and E are forbidden. ""MANLY"" - L is forbidden. ""MANGO"" - O is forbidden.

""JAMES"" - S is forbidden. ""HANKY"" - K is allowed, Y is allowed, but H, A, N, K, Y - all letters are allowed except we need to check the forbidden list. Forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. H, A, N, K, Y - none are forbidden. This seems valid.

But ""HANKY"" is 5 letters, A is in position 2. This seems to fit.

Another option: ""MAMMA"" - but M, A, M, M, A - all letters allowed, but A is in position 2. This is valid, but might be less common.

""JAMMY"" - J, A, M, M, Y - all allowed, A in position 2.

Between these, ""HANKY"" seems more common.

But let me think of a word that uses more distinct letters. ""CANNY"" - C, A, N, N, Y - N is allowed, Y is allowed. This is valid.

""CANNY"" seems like a good choice as it uses C, N, Y which are all allowed, and fits the pattern _ A _ _ _.

Wait, CANNY is C-A-N-N-Y, which has A in position 2, and N is allowed. This seems correct.

But actually, ""CANNY"" has N in positions 3 and 4, which is fine. The forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, N, Y are all allowed.

So, ""CANNY"" is a valid next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""CANTO"" is invalid due to O. ""CANOE"" is invalid due to E and O. ""CAMPS"" invalid due to S. 

""JAMES"" invalid due to S. ""HANKY"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""BANJO"" - but O is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but this is less common. 

""MAPLE"" invalid due to L and E. 

""MANLY"" invalid due to L. 

""MACON"" - M, A, C, O, N - O is forbidden. 

""MANHO"" - O is forbidden. 

""MANLY"" already considered.

""JAMMY"" seems valid. 

Between ""HANKY"" and ""JAMMY"", both are valid. ""HANKY"" might be slightly more common.

But let me think of another word: ""PANIC"" - but I is forbidden. 

""CANON"" - O is forbidden. 

""CAVAL"" - L is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but less common. 

""VAMPS"" - S is forbidden. 

""CAMPS"" - S is forbidden. 

""CANON"" - O is forbidden. 

""CAVIE"" - E is forbidden. 

""CAVUM"" seems the only one with U. 

But ""CAVUM"" is C-A-V-U-M, which has A in position 2, and all letters allowed. This uses V and U which haven't been tested yet. This might be a good guess as it tests new letters.

So, ""CAVUM"" seems like a strong next guess as it introduces V and U while keeping A in position 2.

But let me verify: forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, V, U, M - none are forbidden. This is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""CAVUM"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.
- We need a word with A in position 2 and no other forbidden letters.

A valid word that fits is ""CAVUM"" (though less common), or ""HANKY"". Between these, ""CAVUM"" introduces two new letters (V and U) while fitting the constraints.

- KAM_B → ""KAMBY"" (not a word)
- NAM_B → ""NAMBY"" (not a word)
- PAM_P → ""PAMMY"" (valid word)
- GAMMY → valid (though rarer)
- FAMMY → not standard
- JAMMY → already tried in WAMBY variant, but Y is already fixed at 5

The most straightforward valid word is ""PAMMY"":
- P A M M Y
- All letters allowed: P, A, M, M, Y
- A in 2, M in 3, Y in 5
- M is allowed in position 4 as well

This seems like the best next guess.

""MANLY"" is invalid because Y is allowed but L is forbidden. ""CANDY"" is invalid because D and Y might be okay, but D is forbidden. ""BANAL"" is invalid because B, A, N, A, L - L is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the allowed letters, ""C"" and ""N"" are still available. ""CANTO"" is invalid because O is forbidden. ""CANAL"" is invalid because L is forbidden. ""CAMPS"" is invalid because S is forbidden.\n\n""MAPLE"" is invalid because P, A, M, L, E - L and E are forbidden. ""MANLY"" - L is forbidden. ""MANGO"" - O is forbidden.\n\n""JAMES"" - S is forbidden. ""HANKY"" - K is allowed, Y is allowed, but H, A, N, K, Y - all letters are allowed except we need to check the forbidden list. Forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. H, A, N, K, Y - none are forbidden. This seems valid.\n\nBut ""HANKY"" is 5 letters, A is in position 2. This seems to fit.\n\nAnother option: ""MAMMA"" - but M, A, M, M, A - all letters allowed, but A is in position 2. This is valid, but might be less common.\n\n""JAMMY"" - J, A, M, M, Y - all allowed, A in position 2.\n\nBetween these, ""HANKY"" seems more common.\n\nBut let me think of a word that uses more distinct letters. ""CANNY"" - C, A, N, N, Y - N is allowed, Y is allowed. This is valid.\n\n""CANNY"" seems like a good choice as it uses C, N, Y which are all allowed, and fits the pattern _ A _ _ _.\n\nWait, CANNY is C-A-N-N-Y, which has A in position 2, and N is allowed. This seems correct.\n\nBut actually, ""CANNY"" has N in positions 3 and 4, which is fine. The forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, N, Y are all allowed.\n\nSo, ""CANNY"" is a valid next guess.\n\nBut let me think if there\'s a better word. ""CANTO"" is invalid due to O. ""CANOE"" is invalid due to E and O. ""CAMPS"" invalid due to S. \n\n""JAMES"" invalid due to S. ""HANKY"" seems valid. \n\nAnother option: ""BANJO"" - but O is forbidden. \n\n""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but this is less common. \n\n""MAPLE"" invalid due to L and E. \n\n""MANLY"" invalid due to L. \n\n""MACON"" - M, A, C, O, N - O is forbidden. \n\n""MANHO"" - O is forbidden. \n\n""MANLY"" already considered.\n\n""JAMMY"" seems valid. \n\nBetween ""HANKY"" and ""JAMMY"", both are valid. ""HANKY"" might be slightly more common.\n\nBut let me think of another word: ""PANIC"" - but I is forbidden. \n\n""CANON"" - O is forbidden. \n\n""CAVAL"" - L is forbidden. \n\n""CAVUM"" - U is allowed, but less common. \n\n""VAMPS"" - S is forbidden. \n\n""CAMPS"" - S is forbidden. \n\n""CANON"" - O is forbidden. \n\n""CAVIE"" - E is forbidden. \n\n""CAVUM"" seems the only one with U. \n\nBut ""CAVUM"" is C-A-V-U-M, which has A in position 2, and all letters allowed. This uses V and U which haven\'t been tested yet. This might be a good guess as it tests new letters.\n\nSo, ""CAVUM"" seems like a strong next guess as it introduces V and U while keeping A in position 2.\n\nBut let me verify: forbidden letters are S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O. C, A, V, U, M - none are forbidden. This is valid.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be ""CAVUM"".Based on the feedback:\n- A is confirmed in position 2.\n- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.\n- We need a word with A in position 2 and no other forbidden letters.\n\nA valid word that fits is ""CAVUM"" (though less common), or ""HANKY"".

3. Letters confirmed in positions:
   - A: position 2
   - M: positions 3 & 4
