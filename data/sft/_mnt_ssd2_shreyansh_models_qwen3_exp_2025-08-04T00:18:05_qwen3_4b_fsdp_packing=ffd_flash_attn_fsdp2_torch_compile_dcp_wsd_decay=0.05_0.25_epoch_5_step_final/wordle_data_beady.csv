### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → in the word and in the 3rd position
- T: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but not in 5th position

So far we know:
1. The word has A in position 3.
2. It contains E somewhere, but not in position 5.
3. It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position.
- Contains E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4; but not 5).
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.

Possible letters left (excluding S, L, T): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for words with A in position 3 and E elsewhere:
- E A _ _ _ (but A is fixed at 3, so this is impossible)
- _ E A _ _
- _ _ A E _
- _ _ A _ E (but E can't be at 5, so this is invalid)
- _ _ _ A E (invalid, E can't be at 5)
- _ _ E A _
- _ E _ A _
- E _ _ A _

So valid patterns are:
- _ E A _ _
- _ _ A E _
- _ E _ A _
- E _ _ A _

Let me think of words fitting these patterns:
- _ E A _ _: ""BEACH"" (but has H and C, no S/L/T), ""FEARE"" (but has R), ""PEACH"" (no S/L/T)
- _ _ A E _: ""CRANE"" (has R, N), ""GRANE"" (invalid), ""BRANE"" (invalid), ""DRAPE"" (has P)
- _ E _ A _: ""MEDIA"" (has D, but A is correct position), ""VERGA"" (invalid), ""PERGA"" (invalid)
- E _ _ A _: ""EARTH"" (has T - invalid), ""EVERA"" (invalid), ""EMBRA"" (invalid)

Looking at ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is in wrong position - can't be 5) → invalid

""BEACH"":
- B, E, A, C, H
- A is position 3 (✓)
- E is position 2 (allowed)
- No S, L, T

This seems valid. Let's check:
- B: not tested yet
- E: in word, not at 5 (it's at 2) ✓
- A: correct position ✓
- C, H: new letters

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down possibilities.
