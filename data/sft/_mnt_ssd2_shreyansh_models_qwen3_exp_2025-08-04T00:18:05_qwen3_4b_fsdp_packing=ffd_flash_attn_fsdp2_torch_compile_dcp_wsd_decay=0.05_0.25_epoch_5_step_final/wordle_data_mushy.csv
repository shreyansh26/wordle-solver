For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters in English)
This will help me gather information about multiple common letters and their positions.

From the two guesses we have:

   - C, R, I, P are not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (not in position 1 or 4).
- Does not contain any of L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.
- Uses other remaining letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""BANDS"":
- B, N, D are new letters.
- S appears twice (positions 2 and 5), which is allowed since S could be in multiple positions.
- No forbidden letters are used.

However, since S cannot be in position 1 or 4, and in BANDS it's in positions 2 and 5, this is valid.

Another candidate is ""MOUND"":
- M, O, U, N, D are all new letters.
- No S, but this would waste the S information. So not ideal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters in English)
This will help me gather information about multiple common letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common letters not yet used: R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P are all new letters.
- S is in position 4 (not first, satisfying the feedback).
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, E) are used.

   - S is again marked (-), confirming it is in the word but not in positions 4 or 1.
   - C, R, I, P are not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.

Letters we know ARE in the word: S (position unknown, but not 1 or 4).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (not in position 1 or 4).
- Does not contain any of L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.
- Uses other remaining letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""BANDS"":
- B, N, D are new letters.
- S appears twice (positions 2 and 5), which is allowed since S could be in multiple positions.
- No forbidden letters are used.

However, since S cannot be in position 1 or 4, and in BANDS it's in positions 2 and 5, this is valid.

Another candidate is ""MOUND"":
- M, O, U, N, D are all new letters.
- No S, but this would waste the S information. So not ideal.

Another candidate is ""SHOUL"":
- S, H, O, U, L - but L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""FOULS"":
- F, O, U, L, S - but L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""SHOUL"":
- As above, L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""SNOBS"":
- S, N, O, B, S - no forbidden letters, and S is in positions 1 and 5. But S cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE feedback), so this is invalid.

Another candidate is ""SNUG"":
- Only 4 letters, invalid.

Another candidate is ""SHOUL"":
- As above, L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""DOWNS"":
- D, O, W, N, S - no forbidden letters, S is in position 5 (allowed), and we get info on D, O, W, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters in English)
This will help me gather information about multiple common letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common letters not yet used: R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P are all new letters.
- S is in position 4 (not first, satisfying the feedback).
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, E) are used.

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - S is again marked (-), confirming it is in the word but not in positions 4 or 1.
   - C, R, I, P are not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.

Letters we know ARE in the word: S (position unknown, but not 1 or 4).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (not in position 1 or 4).
- Does not contain any of L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.
- Uses other remaining letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""BANDS"":
- B, N, D are new letters.
- S appears twice (positions 2 and 5), which is allowed since S could be in multiple positions.
- No forbidden letters are used.

However, since S cannot be in position 1 or 4, and in BANDS it's in positions 2 and 5, this is valid.

Another candidate is ""MOUND"":
- M, O, U, N, D are all new letters.
- No S, but this would waste the S information. So not ideal.

Another candidate is ""SHOUL"":
- S, H, O, U, L - but L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""FOULS"":
- F, O, U, L, S - but L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""SHOUL"":
- As above, L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""SNOBS"":
- S, N, O, B, S - no forbidden letters, and S is in positions 1 and 5. But S cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE feedback), so this is invalid.

Another candidate is ""SNUG"":
- Only 4 letters, invalid.

Another candidate is ""SHOUL"":
- As above, L is forbidden.

Another candidate is ""DOWNS"":
- D, O, W, N, S - no forbidden letters, S is in position 5 (allowed), and we get info on D, O, W, N.

This seems like a good choice.

From the three guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, O, W, N

Letters that ARE in the word:  
S (and it is NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5)

Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S in position 2 or 3.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set.
- Is a valid English word.

Possible patterns:
- _ S _ _ _  (S in position 2)
- _ _ S _ _  (S in position 3)

Let’s try S in position 2:  
Possible first letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, Y  
Possible last three letters: combinations of remaining letters.

A good candidate is “HUMPS”:
- H, U, M, P – but P is already ruled out.

Next candidate: “BUGSY” – but “BUGSY” is informal.

Next: “KYSMS” – invalid.

Next: “MYSTY” – T is ruled out.

Next: “FUSKS” – U, K, S – but S is already known, and K is allowed.

Actually, let’s try S in position 3:  
Pattern _ _ S _ _

Candidate: “BUSHY” – H, U, S, Y – but H, U, Y are allowed, and S is in position 3.  
Check letters: B, U, S, H, Y – none are ruled out, and S is in position 3 (allowed).

Another candidate: “FUSKY” – F, U, S, K, Y – also valid.

Between these, “BUSHY” seems more common.

Let’s go with “BUSHY”.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
3. DOWNS → D(x) O(x) W(x) N(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word, not in position 5.
4. BUSHY → B(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)
   - U, S, H, Y are all in the word and in their exact positions:
     - U is in position 2
     - S is in position 3
     - H is in position 4
     - Y is in position 5
   - B is not in the word.

So the word structure is: _ U S H Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, O, W, N, B) and fits the pattern ? U S H Y.

Possible first letters from the remaining set: F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid English words:
- FUSHY – not a common word.
- GUSHY – valid, means moist or humid.
- JUSHY – not a valid word.
- KUSHY – not a valid word.
- MUSHY – valid, means thick or sticky.
- QUSHY – not a valid word.
- VUSHY – not a valid word.
- XUSHY – not a valid word.
- YUSHY – not a valid word.
- ZUSHY – not a valid word.

Between GUSHY and MUSHY, both are valid, but GUSHY is more commonly used in this context.

Therefore, the next guess is GUSHY.
