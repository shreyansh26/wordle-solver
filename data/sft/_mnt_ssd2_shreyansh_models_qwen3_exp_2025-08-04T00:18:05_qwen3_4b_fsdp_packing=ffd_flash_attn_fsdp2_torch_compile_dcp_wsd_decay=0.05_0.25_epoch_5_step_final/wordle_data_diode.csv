### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- A: x → not in the word
- I: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- The word ends with E

- It does NOT contain R, A, or S

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps E in position 5
2. Uses I but not in position 3
3. Avoids R, A, S
4. Uses other common letters to gather more info

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let’s try a word like ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T are common
- I is used but not in position 3 (it’s in position 4)
- Ends with E
- Avoids R, A, S

This should give us new info about U, N, T positions while testing I in a different spot.

   - U, N, T are absent.

So far known:
- Word ends with E.

Let's parse the new feedback from FLIED:

- F: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- I: - → in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew it wasn't in 3, 4, or 5 from earlier feedback)  
  So I must be in position 1 or 2, and this feedback just reconfirms it's not in 3.
- E: - → this is interesting. Earlier we had E(✓) in position 5, so this must mean the E in FLIED is NOT in position 5, but that contradicts our previous knowledge. Wait, no—actually the feedback symbols are per-letter, so the E in FLIED is the 4th letter, and the feedback says ""-"" which means ""in the word but wrong position."" But we know E is fixed in position 5, so this ""-"" here just tells us the E in FLIED is not in position 4, which we already knew. So no new info on E.
- D: - → the D in FLIED is the 5th letter, and feedback says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. But we already had D(✓) in position 4 from CHIDE, so this tells us the D in FLIED is not in position 5, which we already knew.

So the only new info is that F and L are not in the word.  
Known so far:
- Word ends with E.
- D is in position 4.
- I is in position 1 or 2.
- Eliminated letters: R, A, S, U, N, T, C, H, F, L.

Remaining common letters: B, G, M, P, K, V, W, Y, etc.

- Has D in position 4.
- Has E in position 5.
- Uses only remaining letters.

Let's try ""MIDGE"":
- M: new letter
- I: in position 2 (testing this placement)
- D: in position 4 (confirmed)
- G: new letter
- E: in position 5 (confirmed)

But we have to check if all letters are allowed: M, I, D, G, E — none are in the eliminated list.  
This fits the pattern.

Another candidate could be ""PIDGE"" but P is allowed and might be good, but ""MIDGE"" seems simpler.

However, let's verify:  
M, I, D, G, E — all allowed.  
Positions: I is in 2 (testing if I can be in 2), D in 4, E in 5.  
This seems correct.

But actually, from earlier feedback, I must be in position 1 or 2.  
In MIDGE, I is in position 2, so this is valid.

   - U, N, T are absent.

So far known:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains I in position 1 or 2.
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, U, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: C, L, D, P, B, G, H, M, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps I in position 1 or 2 (we’ll test both).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.
- Keeps E in position 5.

A good candidate is “CHIDE”:
- C, H, D are new letters.
- I is in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, S, U, N, T).

This will help determine if C, H, D are present and confirm the position of I.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: CHIDE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) D(✓) E(✓)

From the three guesses we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. D is in the word and is in position 4.
3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from RAISE, UNTIE, and CHIDE).  
   Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.
4. Letters that are definitely absent: R, A, S, U, N, T, C, H.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: D
- Positions 1 or 2: I
- Positions 2 or 1 (whichever isn’t taken by I): ?

We still need to test common remaining letters such as L, M, P, B, G, F, K, etc.  
Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps I in position 1 (we’ll test this placement).
- Uses a new common letter in position 2.
- Keeps D in position 4 and E in position 5.

A good candidate is “FLIED”:
- F and L are new letters.
- I is in position 1 (testing that placement).
- D and E are already confirmed in positions 4 and 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

This will help determine if F or L are present and confirm where I sits.

Let's parse the new feedback from FLIED:

- F: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- I: - → in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew it wasn't in 3, 4, or 5 from earlier feedback)  
  So I must be in position 1 or 2, and this feedback just reconfirms it's not in 3.
- E: - → this is interesting. Earlier we had E(✓) in position 5, so this must mean the E in FLIED is NOT in position 5, but that contradicts our previous knowledge. Wait, no—actually the feedback symbols are per-letter, so the E in FLIED is the 4th letter, and the feedback says ""-"" which means ""in the word but wrong position."" But we know E is fixed in position 5, so this ""-"" here just tells us the E in FLIED is not in position 4, which we already knew. So no new info on E.
- D: - → the D in FLIED is the 5th letter, and feedback says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. But we already had D(✓) in position 4 from CHIDE, so this tells us the D in FLIED is not in position 5, which we already knew.

So the only new info is that F and L are not in the word.  
Known so far:
- Word ends with E.
- D is in position 4.
- I is in position 1 or 2.
- Eliminated letters: R, A, S, U, N, T, C, H, F, L.

Remaining common letters: B, G, M, P, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has I in position 1 or 2.
- Has D in position 4.
- Has E in position 5.
- Uses only remaining letters.

Let's try ""MIDGE"":
- M: new letter
- I: in position 2 (testing this placement)
- D: in position 4 (confirmed)
- G: new letter
- E: in position 5 (confirmed)

But we have to check if all letters are allowed: M, I, D, G, E — none are in the eliminated list.  
This fits the pattern.

Another candidate could be ""PIDGE"" but P is allowed and might be good, but ""MIDGE"" seems simpler.

However, let's verify:  
M, I, D, G, E — all allowed.  
Positions: I is in 2 (testing if I can be in 2), D in 4, E in 5.  
This seems correct.

But actually, from earlier feedback, I must be in position 1 or 2.  
In MIDGE, I is in position 2, so this is valid.

Let's go with MIDGE.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ I _ D E. Common words that fit this pattern:

- P I D E ? → no valid word
- V I D E ? → no valid word
- W I D E ? → no valid word
- K I D E ? → no valid word
- B I _ D E → ""BIDE"" is 4 letters
- P I _ D E → ""PIEDE"" is not a common word
- V I _ D E → ""VIDE"" is 4 letters
- W I _ D E → ""WIDE"" is 4 letters
- P I D E ? → actually ""PIEDE"" is not valid, but ""PIED"" is 4 letters
