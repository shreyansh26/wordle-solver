### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This will help me determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word early on.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere except as the 5th letter.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I now want a word that:
- Uses E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good second guess that satisfies these constraints is “UNTIE”:
- E appears in position 4.
- Uses new common letters U, N, T, I.

This should give useful information about these fresh letters while checking where E can sit.

- E is in position 2 or 3.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.
- Introduces new common consonants.

A good candidate is “BENCH”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This will help me determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere except as the 5th letter.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I now want a word that:
- Uses E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good second guess that satisfies these constraints is “UNTIE”:
- E appears in position 4.
- Uses new common letters U, N, T, I.

This should give useful information about these fresh letters while checking where E can sit.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates A, R, O, S entirely.
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates N, T, I entirely.
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains both E and U.
- E is in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 4, so 2 or 3).
- U is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, T, I.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

I need a word that:
- Uses E and U.
- E is in position 2 or 3.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.
- Introduces new common consonants.

A good candidate is “BENCH”:
- B, N, C, H are new letters.
- E is in position 2.
- U is in position 4 (allowed).
- Doesn’t use any eliminated letters.

This should help determine the placement of E and U while testing new consonants.

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   A, R, O, S, N, T, I, C, H, B, P

2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - E – must be in position 2 (locked-in from bench feedback: E(✓) in slot 2)
   - U – must be somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because positions 1 and 2 are ruled out)
   - D – must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is E, so 1,3,4,5)
   - G – must be somewhere in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (but position 2 is E, so 1,3,4,5)

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ _ with U, D, G filling the remaining slots (and no forbidden letters).

We have three remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but only three known letters to place (U, D, G). That suggests each of U, D, G will occupy one of those slots, with no repeats.

Possible patterns:
- U could be in 3, 4, or 5
- D could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- G could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit the pattern E in slot 2 and only use allowed letters.

- ""GUESS"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""DUDGE"" – repeats D (but we have no info against repeats, yet we have only 3 unique letters to place in 4 slots, so this might be possible)
- ""GUILD"" – contains I and L; I is invalid
- ""JUDGE"" seems clean: J, U, D, G, E – all letters allowed, E in 2, U in 3, D in 4, G in 1.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates A, R, O, S entirely.
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates N, T, I entirely.
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains both E and U.
- E is in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 4, so 2 or 3).
- U is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, T, I.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

I need a word that:
- Uses E and U.
- E is in position 2 or 3.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.
- Introduces new common consonants.

A good candidate is “BENCH”:
- B, N, C, H are new letters.
- E is in position 2.
- U is in position 4 (allowed).
- Doesn’t use any eliminated letters.

This should help determine the placement of E and U while testing new consonants.

Current constraints:

Letters we know:
- Must contain: E (and E is in position 2)
- Must contain: U (but not in position 1)
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, C, H, B

So far we have:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: E
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

We know U is somewhere in positions 2-5, but position 2 is already E, so U must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Remaining unused common letters: D, F, G, L, M, P, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Contains U somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- Uses only allowed letters (no A,R,O,S,N,T,I,C,H,B)

Possible structure: ? E ? U ? or ? E U ? or ? E ? ? U

Let's think of words fitting this pattern:
- ""DEWUP"" - not valid
- ""FUEL"" - too short
- ""GUESS"" - contains S (invalid)
- ""LUME"" - too short
- ""MULE"" - contains L and U, but E is in position 2? No, E is at the end.
- ""PUDGE"" - contains D and G, U is in position 3, E in 2. This seems valid.

""PUDGE"" fits all constraints:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from feedback)
- U is in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters used: P, U, D, G, E - none are eliminated

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   A, R, O, S, N, T, I, C, H, B, P

2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - E – must be in position 2 (locked-in from bench feedback: E(✓) in slot 2)
   - U – must be somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because positions 1 and 2 are ruled out)
   - D – must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is E, so 1,3,4,5)
   - G – must be somewhere in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (but position 2 is E, so 1,3,4,5)

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ _ with U, D, G filling the remaining slots (and no forbidden letters).

We have three remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but only three known letters to place (U, D, G). That suggests each of U, D, G will occupy one of those slots, with no repeats.

Possible patterns:
- U could be in 3, 4, or 5
- D could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- G could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit the pattern E in slot 2 and only use allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- ""JUDGE"" – J is unused, U,D,G,E all present, E fixed at 2. This is valid.
- ""GUESS"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""DUDGE"" – repeats D (but we have no info against repeats, yet we have only 3 unique letters to place in 4 slots, so this might be possible)
- ""GUILD"" – contains I and L; I is invalid
- ""JUDGE"" seems clean: J, U, D, G, E – all letters allowed, E in 2, U in 3, D in 4, G in 1.

Let’s choose ""JUDGE"" as the next logical guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word (eliminated):
   A, R, O, S, N, T, I, C, H, B, P, J

2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - E – must be in position 2 (locked-in from bench feedback: E(✓) in slot 2)
   - U – must be somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 2 ruled out)
   - D – must be somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (position 2 is E)
   - G – must be somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (position 2 is E)

So the word is _ E _ _ _ with U, D, G filling the remaining three slots (and no repeats, because we have only three unique letters to fill four slots – meaning one of these letters must appear twice, but that seems unlikely without evidence).

Looking at real 5-letter words:
- ""GUESS"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""DUDGE"" – repeats D
- ""JUDGE"" – already tried (J invalid)
- ""FUDGE"" – contains F, U, D, G, E – all letters allowed, E in 2, U in 3, D in 4, G in 1
- ""MUDGE"" – M is allowed, but we have no info on M
- ""LUDGE"" – L is allowed, but again no info

""FUDGE"" uses all four of the required letters (F is new, but that’s okay) and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, ""FUDGE"" is the next logical guess.
