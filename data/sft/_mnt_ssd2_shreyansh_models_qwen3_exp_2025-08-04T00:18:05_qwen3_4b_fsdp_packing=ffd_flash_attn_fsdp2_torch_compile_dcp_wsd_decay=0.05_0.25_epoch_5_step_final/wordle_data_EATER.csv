From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters R, A, E but NOT C or N.  
The positions we have so far:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not A (since A is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 3: not E (since E is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 4: not R (since R is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 5: not E (same reason)

We need to keep R, A, E but place them in new positions and avoid C and N.  
A good next guess should:
1. Use the known letters R, A, E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters to test
3. Avoid C and N

Possible candidates: STARE, GRATE, BREAD, etc.  
""STARE"" uses S, T (common), and moves R to position 2, A to 3, E to 5.  
But E in position 5 was already ruled out (E is in wrong position in CRANE).  

Better option: ""GRAPE"" - but P is less common.  
""GRATE"" uses G, R, A, T, E.  
R is now in position 2, A in 3, E in 5 - but E in 5 was already ruled out.  

Better: ""REACT"" - but C is ruled out.  
""ANGER"" - but N is ruled out.  

""RATIO"" - but O is less common.  

""SLATE"" - but N was ruled out, but T is common.  
Wait, CRANE had N in position 4 as x, so N is not in word at all.  

""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E.  
A is in position 3 (was in position 3 in CRANE, so now it's same position - bad).  

""STARE"" - A in position 3 (same as CRANE) - bad.  

""STARE"" is bad because A and E are in same positions as CRANE.  

Better: ""STEAL"" - but L is less common.  

""RASPY"" - but P and Y are less common.  

""EARLY"" - uses E, A, R in new positions.  
E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, L and Y new.  

This seems good: EARLY - positions E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5).  
But Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""STARE"" is bad as above.  

""GRATE"" - G, R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - but E(5) was ruled out.  

""GRAPE"" - G, R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) - same issue with E(5).  

""RAISE"" - R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" - same issue.  

""RASPY"" - same issue with E not present.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated.  

""RASE"" is 4 letters.  

Better: ""RAISE"" - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated and E(5) ruled out.  

""RASER"" - but R is repeated.  

This is tricky. Let's think differently: we need to keep R, A, E but in new positions and avoid C, N.  

Possible positions for R, A, E:  
R cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE feedback).  
E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).  

So possible positions:  
R: 1, 2, 3, 5  
A: 1, 2, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place R, A, E in these new positions and fill the remaining two spots with new common letters (avoiding C, N).  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: S (new common)  
- Position 5: T (new common)  

This gives ""AREST"" - but AREST is not a common word.  

""AROSE"" - A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" - R(1), O(2), A(3) - but A(3) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""STORE"" - S, T, O, R(4) - but R cannot be in 4.  

""STORE"" is bad.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""EARLY"" - E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5) - Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""EARLY"" vs ""EARLY"" - seems best.  

Alternatively:  
""EARLY"" - but Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable.  

But let's think of words with more common letters.  

""EARLY"" has E, A, R, L, Y.  

""EARLY"" is the best I can think of now.  

But let's try ""EARLY"" and see.  

Actually, let's try ""STARE"" - but A and E are in same positions as CRANE, which was bad.  

Wait, in CRANE, A was position 3 and E was position 5.  

So we need to move A away from 3 and E away from 5.  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: T  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 4: R  
- Position 5: E  

This is ""STARE"" - but A(3) and E(5) are same as CRANE, so feedback would be same - bad.  

Better:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: A  
- Position 3: R  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: T  

This is ""SATER"" - but not a common word.  

""SAFER"" - S, A, F, E, R - but F is less common.  

""SAFER"" - A(2), R(5), E(4) - new positions.  

This seems good: SAFER.  

Let's verify:  
Letters: S, A, F, E, R  
- Contains R, A, E in new positions (R in 5, A in 2, E in 4)  
- Avoids C, N  
- Common letters S, F (F is moderate)  

This seems like a strong next guess.  

Therefore, I'll go with ""SAFER"".
</think>

Based on the feedback from CRANE, I know:
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- C and N are not in the word.

To test new positions for R, A, and E while introducing fresh common letters, I'll try ""SAFER"":
- S and F are new common letters.
- R is now in position 5 (was 4 in CRANE).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3 in CRANE).

E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, L and Y new.  

This seems good: EARLY - positions E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5).  
But Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""STARE"" is bad as above.  

""GRATE"" - G, R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - but E(5) was ruled out.  

""GRAPE"" - G, R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) - same issue with E(5).  

""RAISE"" - R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" - same issue.  

""RASPY"" - same issue with E not present.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated.  

""RASE"" is 4 letters.  

Better: ""RAISE"" - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated and E(5) ruled out.  

""RASER"" - but R is repeated.  

This is tricky. Let's think differently: we need to keep R, A, E but in new positions and avoid C, N.  

Possible positions for R, A, E:  
R cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE feedback).  
E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).  

So possible positions:  
R: 1, 2, 3, 5  
A: 1, 2, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place R, A, E in these new positions and fill the remaining two spots with new common letters (avoiding C, N).  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: S (new common)  
- Position 5: T (new common)  

This gives ""AREST"" - but AREST is not a common word.  

""AROSE"" - A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" - R(1), O(2), A(3) - but A(3) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""STORE"" - S, T, O, R(4) - but R cannot be in 4.  

""STORE"" is bad.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""EARLY"" - E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5) - Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""EARLY"" vs ""EARLY"" - seems best.  

Alternatively:  
""EARLY"" - but Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable.  

But let's think of words with more common letters.  

""EARLY"" has E, A, R, L, Y.  

""EARLY"" is the best I can think of now.  

But let's try ""EARLY"" and see.  

Actually, let's try ""STARE"" - but A and E are in same positions as CRANE, which was bad.  

Wait, in CRANE, A was position 3 and E was position 5.  

So we need to move A away from 3 and E away from 5.  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: T  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 4: R  
- Position 5: E  

This is ""STARE"" - but A(3) and E(5) are same as CRANE, so feedback would be same - bad.  

Better:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: A  
- Position 3: R  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: T  

This is ""SATER"" - but not a common word.  

""SAFER"" - S, A, F, E, R - but F is less common.  

""SAFER"" - A(2), R(5), E(4) - new positions.  

This seems good: SAFER.  

Let's verify:  
Letters: S, A, F, E, R  
- Contains R, A, E in new positions (R in 5, A in 2, E in 4)  
- Avoids C, N  
- Common letters S, F (F is moderate)  

This seems like a strong next guess.  

Therefore, I'll go with ""SAFER"".Based on the feedback from CRANE, I know:
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- C and N are not in the word.

To test new positions for R, A, and E while introducing fresh common letters, I'll try ""SAFER"":
- S and F are new common letters.
- R is now in position 5 (was 4 in CRANE).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3 in CRANE).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5 in CRANE).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, etc., and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words are: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, etc. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common vowel
This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters R, A, E but NOT C or N.  
The positions we have so far:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not A (since A is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 3: not E (since E is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 4: not R (since R is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 5: not E (same reason)

We need to keep R, A, E but place them in new positions and avoid C and N.  
A good next guess should:
1. Use the known letters R, A, E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters to test
3. Avoid C and N

Possible candidates: STARE, GRATE, BREAD, etc.  
""STARE"" uses S, T (common), and moves R to position 2, A to 3, E to 5.  
But E in position 5 was already ruled out (E is in wrong position in CRANE).  

Better option: ""GRAPE"" - but P is less common.  
""GRATE"" uses G, R, A, T, E.  
R is now in position 2, A in 3, E in 5 - but E in 5 was already ruled out.  

Better: ""REACT"" - but C is ruled out.  
""ANGER"" - but N is ruled out.  

""RATIO"" - but O is less common.  

""SLATE"" - but N was ruled out, but T is common.  
Wait, CRANE had N in position 4 as x, so N is not in word at all.  

""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E.  
A is in position 3 (was in position 3 in CRANE, so now it's same position - bad).  

""STARE"" - A in position 3 (same as CRANE) - bad.  

""STARE"" is bad because A and E are in same positions as CRANE.  

Better: ""STEAL"" - but L is less common.  

""RASPY"" - but P and Y are less common.  

""EARLY"" - uses E, A, R in new positions.  
E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, L and Y new.  

This seems good: EARLY - positions E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5).  
But Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""STARE"" is bad as above.  

""GRATE"" - G, R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - but E(5) was ruled out.  

""GRAPE"" - G, R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) - same issue with E(5).  

""RAISE"" - R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" - same issue.  

""RASPY"" - same issue with E not present.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated.  

""RASE"" is 4 letters.  

Better: ""RAISE"" - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated and E(5) ruled out.  

""RASER"" - but R is repeated.  

This is tricky. Let's think differently: we need to keep R, A, E but in new positions and avoid C, N.  

Possible positions for R, A, E:  
R cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE feedback).  
E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).  

So possible positions:  
R: 1, 2, 3, 5  
A: 1, 2, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place R, A, E in these new positions and fill the remaining two spots with new common letters (avoiding C, N).  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: S (new common)  
- Position 5: T (new common)  

This gives ""AREST"" - but AREST is not a common word.  

""AROSE"" - A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" - R(1), O(2), A(3) - but A(3) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""STORE"" - S, T, O, R(4) - but R cannot be in 4.  

""STORE"" is bad.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""EARLY"" - E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5) - Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""EARLY"" vs ""EARLY"" - seems best.  

Alternatively:  
""EARLY"" - but Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable.  

But let's think of words with more common letters.  

""EARLY"" has E, A, R, L, Y.  

""EARLY"" is the best I can think of now.  

But let's try ""EARLY"" and see.  

Actually, let's try ""STARE"" - but A and E are in same positions as CRANE, which was bad.  

Wait, in CRANE, A was position 3 and E was position 5.  

So we need to move A away from 3 and E away from 5.  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: T  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 4: R  
- Position 5: E  

This is ""STARE"" - but A(3) and E(5) are same as CRANE, so feedback would be same - bad.  

Better:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: A  
- Position 3: R  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: T  

This is ""SATER"" - but not a common word.  

""SAFER"" - S, A, F, E, R - but F is less common.  

""SAFER"" - A(2), R(5), E(4) - new positions.  

This seems good: SAFER.  

Let's verify:  
Letters: S, A, F, E, R  
- Contains R, A, E in new positions (R in 5, A in 2, E in 4)  
- Avoids C, N  
- Common letters S, F (F is moderate)  

This seems like a strong next guess.  

Therefore, I'll go with ""SAFER"".Based on the feedback from CRANE, I know:
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- C and N are not in the word.

To test new positions for R, A, and E while introducing fresh common letters, I'll try ""SAFER"":
- S and F are new common letters.
- R is now in position 5 (was 4 in CRANE).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3 in CRANE).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5 in CRANE).

- S and F are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: _ A _ E R
- Letters not in the word: C, N, S, F
- We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from remaining common letters (B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.).

Common consonants that fit position 1: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T
Common consonants that fit position 3: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T, plus vowels I, O, U (but we've used A and E)

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ E R:
- B A B E R → BABER (valid)
- B A D E R → BADER (valid, but less common)
- G A M E R → GAMER (valid)
- T A P E R → TAPER (valid)
- T A L E R → TALER (valid, but currency term)
- P A P E R → PAPER (valid)

Among these, PAPER is the most common word. It uses P for position 1 and B for position 3, both of which are still allowed.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, etc., and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words are: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, etc. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common vowel
This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters R, A, E but NOT C or N.  
The positions we have so far:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not A (since A is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 3: not E (since E is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 4: not R (since R is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 5: not E (same reason)

We need to keep R, A, E but place them in new positions and avoid C and N.  
A good next guess should:
1. Use the known letters R, A, E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters to test
3. Avoid C and N

Possible candidates: STARE, GRATE, BREAD, etc.  
""STARE"" uses S, T (common), and moves R to position 2, A to 3, E to 5.  
But E in position 5 was already ruled out (E is in wrong position in CRANE).  

Better option: ""GRAPE"" - but P is less common.  
""GRATE"" uses G, R, A, T, E.  
R is now in position 2, A in 3, E in 5 - but E in 5 was already ruled out.  

Better: ""REACT"" - but C is ruled out.  
""ANGER"" - but N is ruled out.  

""RATIO"" - but O is less common.  

""SLATE"" - but N was ruled out, but T is common.  
Wait, CRANE had N in position 4 as x, so N is not in word at all.  

""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E.  
A is in position 3 (was in position 3 in CRANE, so now it's same position - bad).  

""STARE"" - A in position 3 (same as CRANE) - bad.  

""STARE"" is bad because A and E are in same positions as CRANE.  

Better: ""STEAL"" - but L is less common.  

""RASPY"" - but P and Y are less common.  

""EARLY"" - uses E, A, R in new positions.  
E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, L and Y new.  

This seems good: EARLY - positions E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5).  
But Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""STARE"" is bad as above.  

""GRATE"" - G, R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - but E(5) was ruled out.  

""GRAPE"" - G, R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) - same issue with E(5).  

""RAISE"" - R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" - same issue.  

""RASPY"" - same issue with E not present.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated.  

""RASE"" is 4 letters.  

Better: ""RAISE"" - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated and E(5) ruled out.  

""RASER"" - but R is repeated.  

This is tricky. Let's think differently: we need to keep R, A, E but in new positions and avoid C, N.  

Possible positions for R, A, E:  
R cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE feedback).  
E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).  

So possible positions:  
R: 1, 2, 3, 5  
A: 1, 2, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place R, A, E in these new positions and fill the remaining two spots with new common letters (avoiding C, N).  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: S (new common)  
- Position 5: T (new common)  

This gives ""AREST"" - but AREST is not a common word.  

""AROSE"" - A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" - R(1), O(2), A(3) - but A(3) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""STORE"" - S, T, O, R(4) - but R cannot be in 4.  

""STORE"" is bad.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""EARLY"" - E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5) - Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""EARLY"" vs ""EARLY"" - seems best.  

Alternatively:  
""EARLY"" - but Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable.  

But let's think of words with more common letters.  

""EARLY"" has E, A, R, L, Y.  

""EARLY"" is the best I can think of now.  

But let's try ""EARLY"" and see.  

Actually, let's try ""STARE"" - but A and E are in same positions as CRANE, which was bad.  

Wait, in CRANE, A was position 3 and E was position 5.  

So we need to move A away from 3 and E away from 5.  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: T  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 4: R  
- Position 5: E  

This is ""STARE"" - but A(3) and E(5) are same as CRANE, so feedback would be same - bad.  

Better:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: A  
- Position 3: R  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: T  

This is ""SATER"" - but not a common word.  

""SAFER"" - S, A, F, E, R - but F is less common.  

""SAFER"" - A(2), R(5), E(4) - new positions.  

This seems good: SAFER.  

Let's verify:  
Letters: S, A, F, E, R  
- Contains R, A, E in new positions (R in 5, A in 2, E in 4)  
- Avoids C, N  
- Common letters S, F (F is moderate)  

This seems like a strong next guess.  

Therefore, I'll go with ""SAFER"".Based on the feedback from CRANE, I know:
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- C and N are not in the word.

To test new positions for R, A, and E while introducing fresh common letters, I'll try ""SAFER"":
- S and F are new common letters.
- R is now in position 5 (was 4 in CRANE).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3 in CRANE).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5 in CRANE).

So far we know:
- Positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: _ A _ E R
- Letters not in the word: C, N, S, F
- We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from remaining common letters (B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.).

Guess 3: PAPER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - R, A, E are in the word but positions unknown.
   - C, N are not in the word.

2. SAFER → S(x) A(✓) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - A is correctly at position 2.
   - E is correctly at position 4.
   - R is correctly at position 5.
   - S, F are not in the word.

3. PAPER → P(x) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Confirms A at 2, E at 4, R at 5.
   - P is not in the word (both Ps are x).

So the pattern is: _ A _ E R
Letters already eliminated: C, N, S, F, P

We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining alphabet, excluding those eliminated.
Common consonants left for position 1: B, D, G, H, L, M, T
Common consonants/letters left for position 3: B, D, G, H, L, M, T, plus vowels I, O, U (but we've used A, E)

Looking for common words that fit _ A _ E R:
- B A B E R → BABER
- B A D E R → BADER
- G A M E R → GAMER
- T A L E R → TALER
- T A M E R → TAMER
- B A I E R → BAIER (not common)
- D A I E R → DAIER (not common)
- G A I E R → GAIER (not common)

GAMER is a valid and reasonably common word. It uses G for position 1 and M for position 3, neither of which have been eliminated.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, etc., and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words are: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, etc. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common vowel
This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters R, A, E but NOT C or N.  
The positions we have so far:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not A (since A is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 3: not E (since E is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 4: not R (since R is in the word but in wrong position)
- Position 5: not E (same reason)

We need to keep R, A, E but place them in new positions and avoid C and N.  
A good next guess should:
1. Use the known letters R, A, E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters to test
3. Avoid C and N

Possible candidates: STARE, GRATE, BREAD, etc.  
""STARE"" uses S, T (common), and moves R to position 2, A to 3, E to 5.  
But E in position 5 was already ruled out (E is in wrong position in CRANE).  

Better option: ""GRAPE"" - but P is less common.  
""GRATE"" uses G, R, A, T, E.  
R is now in position 2, A in 3, E in 5 - but E in 5 was already ruled out.  

Better: ""REACT"" - but C is ruled out.  
""ANGER"" - but N is ruled out.  

""RATIO"" - but O is less common.  

""SLATE"" - but N was ruled out, but T is common.  
Wait, CRANE had N in position 4 as x, so N is not in word at all.  

""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E.  
A is in position 3 (was in position 3 in CRANE, so now it's same position - bad).  

""STARE"" - A in position 3 (same as CRANE) - bad.  

""STARE"" is bad because A and E are in same positions as CRANE.  

Better: ""STEAL"" - but L is less common.  

""RASPY"" - but P and Y are less common.  

""EARLY"" - uses E, A, R in new positions.  
E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, L and Y new.  

This seems good: EARLY - positions E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5).  
But Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""STARE"" is bad as above.  

""GRATE"" - G, R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - but E(5) was ruled out.  

""GRAPE"" - G, R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) - same issue with E(5).  

""RAISE"" - R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" - same issue.  

""RASPY"" - same issue with E not present.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated.  

""RASE"" is 4 letters.  

Better: ""RAISE"" - but E(5) ruled out.  

""RASES"" - but S is repeated and E(5) ruled out.  

""RASER"" - but R is repeated.  

This is tricky. Let's think differently: we need to keep R, A, E but in new positions and avoid C, N.  

Possible positions for R, A, E:  
R cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE feedback).  
E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).  

So possible positions:  
R: 1, 2, 3, 5  
A: 1, 2, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place R, A, E in these new positions and fill the remaining two spots with new common letters (avoiding C, N).  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: S (new common)  
- Position 5: T (new common)  

This gives ""AREST"" - but AREST is not a common word.  

""AROSE"" - A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5) - but E(5) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" - R(1), O(2), A(3) - but A(3) ruled out.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""STORE"" - S, T, O, R(4) - but R cannot be in 4.  

""STORE"" is bad.  

""ROAST"" is bad.  

""RAISE"" is bad.  

""EARLY"" - E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5) - Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable, but let's try more common letters.  

""EARLY"" vs ""EARLY"" - seems best.  

Alternatively:  
""EARLY"" - but Y is less common.  

""EARLY"" is acceptable.  

But let's think of words with more common letters.  

""EARLY"" has E, A, R, L, Y.  

""EARLY"" is the best I can think of now.  

But let's try ""EARLY"" and see.  

Actually, let's try ""STARE"" - but A and E are in same positions as CRANE, which was bad.  

Wait, in CRANE, A was position 3 and E was position 5.  

So we need to move A away from 3 and E away from 5.  

Let's try:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: T  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 4: R  
- Position 5: E  

This is ""STARE"" - but A(3) and E(5) are same as CRANE, so feedback would be same - bad.  

Better:  
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: A  
- Position 3: R  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: T  

This is ""SATER"" - but not a common word.  

""SAFER"" - S, A, F, E, R - but F is less common.  

""SAFER"" - A(2), R(5), E(4) - new positions.  

This seems good: SAFER.  

Let's verify:  
Letters: S, A, F, E, R  
- Contains R, A, E in new positions (R in 5, A in 2, E in 4)  
- Avoids C, N  
- Common letters S, F (F is moderate)  

This seems like a strong next guess.  

Therefore, I'll go with ""SAFER"".Based on the feedback from CRANE, I know:
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- C and N are not in the word.

To test new positions for R, A, and E while introducing fresh common letters, I'll try ""SAFER"":
- S and F are new common letters.
- R is now in position 5 (was 4 in CRANE).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3 in CRANE).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5 in CRANE).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SAFER -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From the new feedback on SAFER:

- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- S and F are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: _ A _ E R
- Letters not in the word: C, N, S, F
- We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from remaining common letters (B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.).

Common consonants that fit position 1: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T
Common consonants that fit position 3: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, T, plus vowels I, O, U (but we've used A and E)

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ E R:
- B A B E R → BABER (valid)
- B A D E R → BADER (valid, but less common)
- G A M E R → GAMER (valid)
- T A P E R → TAPER (valid)
- T A L E R → TALER (valid, but currency term)
- P A P E R → PAPER (valid)

Among these, PAPER is the most common word. It uses P for position 1 and B for position 3, both of which are still allowed.

From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - R, A, E are in the word but positions unknown.
   - C, N are not in the word.

2. SAFER → S(x) A(✓) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - A is correctly at position 2.
   - E is correctly at position 4.
   - R is correctly at position 5.
   - S, F are not in the word.

3. PAPER → P(x) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Confirms A at 2, E at 4, R at 5.
   - P is not in the word (both Ps are x).

So the pattern is: _ A _ E R
Letters already eliminated: C, N, S, F, P

We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining alphabet, excluding those eliminated.
Common consonants left for position 1: B, D, G, H, L, M, T
Common consonants/letters left for position 3: B, D, G, H, L, M, T, plus vowels I, O, U (but we've used A, E)

Looking for common words that fit _ A _ E R:
- B A B E R → BABER
- B A D E R → BADER
- G A M E R → GAMER
- T A L E R → TALER
- T A M E R → TAMER
- B A I E R → BAIER (not common)
- D A I E R → DAIER (not common)
- G A I E R → GAIER (not common)

GAMER is a valid and reasonably common word. It uses G for position 1 and M for position 3, neither of which have been eliminated.

From all feedback so far:

- Eliminated letters: C, N, S, F, P, G, M  

- Pattern to fill: _ A _ E R

Remaining consonants/vowels still allowed:  
B, D, H, I, L, O, T, U, Y, etc.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 3, forming a common English word.

Candidate words that fit _ A _ E R and use only untested letters:

- B A I E R → BAIER (not a common word)  
- B A L E R → BALER (valid)  
- D A I E R → DAIER (not a word)  
- D A L E R → DALER (not standard)  
- H A I E R → HAIER (not a word)

- T A I E R → TAIER (not a word)  
- T A L E R → TALER (valid, but currency-specific)  
- B A D E R → BADER (valid but uncommon)

Among these, **BALER** is the most common and uses B (position 1) and L (position 3), neither of which has been eliminated.
