### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter and position, or eliminating several letters that aren't in the word. 

Another good option might be ""AROSE"" or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" seems slightly more balanced for a first guess. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter and position, or eliminating several letters that aren't in the word. 

Another good option might be ""AROSE"" or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" seems slightly more balanced for a first guess. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- E is correct in position 5 (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern we now know is:
S _ _ _ E

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not L, A, T). Also, we should avoid repeating S or E in those positions.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Let's think of words that fit S _ _ _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:
- SMEER (but M is okay, but E is already fixed at 5)
- SPREE (but P and R are new)
- STONE (but T is ruled out)
- SNARE (N and R are new)
- SHINE (H and N are new)

""SHINE"" looks good because:
- H and N are new letters
- I is a new vowel
- It fits the S _ _ _ E pattern

Let's try SHINE.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common combinations:
- Position 2: common consonants left are B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, R, etc.
- Position 4: must be a letter that forms a valid word with the others

Let's brainstorm possible words:
- SCIBE? Not valid

- SPIRE? P and R are allowed
- SMILE? M is allowed, but L is ruled out
- SPEIRE? Not valid
- SQUIE? Not valid
- SCREE? C and R are allowed
- SPIKE? K is allowed, but ends with K, not E
- SIREN? N is ruled out
- SPIRE seems valid: S P I R E

SPIRE:
- S (✓) in 1
- P (new) in 2

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- E is correct in position 5 (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern we now know is:
S _ _ _ E

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not L, A, T). Also, we should avoid repeating S or E in those positions.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Let's think of words that fit S _ _ _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:
- SMEER (but M is okay, but E is already fixed at 5)
- SPREE (but P and R are new)
- STONE (but T is ruled out)
- SNARE (N and R are new)
- SHINE (H and N are new)

""SHINE"" looks good because:
- H and N are new letters
- I is a new vowel
- It fits the S _ _ _ E pattern

Let's try SHINE.

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: S _ I _ E  (positions 1, 3, 5 are fixed; 2 and 4 are unknown)
2. Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, H, N
3. Letters still available for positions 2 and 4: all letters except S, E, I and the ruled-out set {L, A, T, H, N}

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has I in the 3rd position
- Ends with E
- Uses letters not in {L, A, T, H, N}

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common combinations:
- Position 2: common consonants left are B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, R, etc.
- Position 4: must be a letter that forms a valid word with the others

Let's brainstorm possible words:
- SCIBE? Not valid
- SCIRE? Not valid
- SPIRE? P and R are allowed
- SMILE? M is allowed, but L is ruled out
- SPEIRE? Not valid
- SQUIE? Not valid
- SCREE? C and R are allowed
- SPIKE? K is allowed, but ends with K, not E
- SIREN? N is ruled out
- SPIRE seems valid: S P I R E

SPIRE:
- S (✓) in 1
- P (new) in 2
- I (✓) in 3
- R (new) in 4
- E (✓) in 5

No letters conflict with previous feedback.

Current known facts:
1. Fixed pattern: S _ I _ E (positions 1, 3, 5 are locked)
2. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, H, N, P, R
3. Remaining available letters (for positions 2 and 4):  
   B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has I in the 3rd position
- Ends with E
- Uses only the allowed letters for positions 2 and 4

Looking at common English words fitting S _ I _ E:
- SCIME? Not valid
- SKIVE? V is allowed, but word is SKIVE (but we have I in 3rd, so S K I V E – this fits!)
- SMOKE? O is allowed (since O wasn’t ruled out)
- SWIVE? V is allowed
- SQUIE? Not a valid word
- SCREE? R is ruled out
- SKINE? N is ruled out
- SMITE? T is ruled out

From these, SKIVE and SMOKE are both valid. SKIVE uses letters K and V, which haven’t been ruled out. SMOKE uses M and O. Between these, SKIVE seems slightly more common in word-guessing contexts.

Let’s go with SKIVE.

- SBIKE? Not a word
- SCIME? Not a word
- SCREE? R is ruled out
- SFIKE? Not a word
- SUIPE? Not a word
- SWIME? Not a word
- SWEIE? Not a word

The only valid word left that fits is SMOKE, which uses M and O. O wasn’t in any previous guesses, so it hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SMOKE.
