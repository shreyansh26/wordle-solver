### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
2. It definitely contains A, but A is not in position 1, 3, or 5 (from both guesses).  
   So A must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, P, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with A in either position 2 or 4, and avoiding all the forbidden letters.

Let’s list candidate patterns:

- _ A _ _ E  (A in position 2)
- _ _ _ A E  (A in position 4)

Using remaining common consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.) and vowels (I, U, possibly another E or O but O is banned).

Good candidates:
- B A N K E → but K is okay, N is okay, word is valid.
- C A N C E → C twice, but valid.
- F A C E → valid.
- G A M E → valid.
- H A N K E → valid.
- M A N E → valid.
- C A D E → valid.
- V A N E → valid.

Among these, “GAME” is simple, uses common letters, and fits the constraints perfectly.

The feedback from Guess 3 says “Model answer is not five letters,” so “GAME” was rejected.  
Therefore, the actual word must be **exactly five letters**, and “GAME” is not a valid candidate (likely because the correct word has a different spelling or is case-sensitive).  

We need to adjust our next guess to:
- Keep the confirmed E in position 5.
- Ensure A is in position 2 or 4 (since it cannot be 1, 3, or 5).
- Avoid all the banned letters: R, O, S, P, L, T.
- Use a valid five-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(x): O is not in the word at all
- S(x): S is not in the word at all
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct 5th position

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that has A somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 4) and avoids R, O, S.

Possible structure: _ A _ _ E or _ _ A _ E or _ _ _ A E

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let's try ""PLATE"":
- P: new letter
- L: new letter
- A: known to be in word (position 3 here)
- T: new letter
- E: confirmed at position 5

This tests new consonants while placing A in position 3.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
2. It definitely contains A, but A is not in position 1, 3, or 5 (from both guesses).  
   So A must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, P, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with A in either position 2 or 4, and avoiding all the forbidden letters.

Let’s list candidate patterns:

- _ A _ _ E  (A in position 2)
- _ _ _ A E  (A in position 4)

Using remaining common consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.) and vowels (I, U, possibly another E or O but O is banned).

Good candidates:
- B A N K E → but K is okay, N is okay, word is valid.
- C A N C E → C twice, but valid.
- F A C E → valid.
- G A M E → valid.
- H A N K E → valid.
- M A N E → valid.
- C A D E → valid.
- V A N E → valid.

Among these, “GAME” is simple, uses common letters, and fits the constraints perfectly.

Check:
- G: new
- A: known to be in word (position 2 here)
- M: new
- E: confirmed at position 5
- Forbidden letters avoided.

So “GAME” is a strong next guess.
