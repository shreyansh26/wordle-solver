For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most common and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives me good coverage of potential letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: L, A, E
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, T
- Positions to avoid for L, A, E: L≠2, A≠3, E≠5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E (but not in the forbidden positions).
2. Does not contain S or T.
3. Uses other letters that are still possible (not ruled out yet).

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, etc. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. One possibility is ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since E was only forbidden from position 5).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was only forbidden from position 3).
- R is a new letter (not ruled out).
- L is in position 4 (allowed, since L was only forbidden from position 2).
- Y is a new letter (not ruled out).

This seems like a strong next guess as it places the known letters in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

Letters that are in the word:
- L (but not in positions 2 or 4)
- A (but not in positions 3 or 2)
- E (but not in positions 5 or 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y

So far the confirmed letters are L, A, E, and they must appear in the remaining slots:
- E can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it’s not in 1 or 5)
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 2 or 3)
- L can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 2 or 4)

We need a 5-letter word that uses L, A, E exactly once each and two new letters that have not been tested yet. Good unused common letters are I, N, O, C, D, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places:
- E in position 2
- A in position 4
- L in position 1 or 3

Trying E in 2, A in 4, L in 3 gives: L _ E A _  
We need two more letters. Let’s pick I and N:  
Possible word: L I E A N → “LIEAN” (invalid, not a word)  
Swap to keep common endings: L E I A N → no.  

Try E in 2, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ _ A  
Then we need letters for positions 3 and 4. Try C and O: L C O E A → “LCOEA” (no).  
Try N and D: L N D E A → no.

Try N and D: L N E A D → no.  

Try E in 4, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ E A  
Need letters 2 and 3. Try I and N: L I N E A → “LINEA” (no).  
Try C and O: L O C E A → no.  

Try L in 3, E in 2, A in 5: _ L E _ A  
Need letters 1 and 4. Try N and I: N L E I A → no.  
Try C and O: C L E O A → no.  

Try L in 5, E in 2, A in 4: _ _ E A L  
Need letters 1 and 2. Try N and I: N I E A L → no.  
Try C and O: C O E A L → no.  

Let’s look for real words. One that fits constraints is “CLEAN”:
- C, N are new letters.
- L is in position 2 (but L was only forbidden in 2 and 4, so this is invalid).

Next candidate: “PLANE”
- P is new.
- L is in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ELAND”
- E is in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “LEANT” (contains T, forbidden).

Next: “ALONE”
- A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ANELE” (not a word).

Next: “ELAIN” (not a word).

Next: “CLAVE”
- C new, V new.
- L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “CANOE”
- C, O new.
- A in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “COALE” (not a word).

Next: “ALOHE” (not a word).

Next: “PECAN”
- P, N new.
- E in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “ANEL” + one more letter.

Let me try “ALONE” again: A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ELAND”: E in 1 (forbidden).

Let me try “PLANE”: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ANELE”: not a word.

Let me try “NECKL” (invalid).

Let me try “CLEAT” (contains T, forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ALC E” (no).

Let me try “LAICE” (not a word).

Let me try “ELICA” (not a word).

Let me try “AELIC” (not a word).

Let me try “LEICA” (a real word):
- L is in 1 (allowed).
- E is in 2 (allowed).
- I, C are new.
- A is in 4 (allowed).

So “LEICA” fits all constraints:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most common and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives me good coverage of potential letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: L, A, E
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, T
- Positions to avoid for L, A, E: L≠2, A≠3, E≠5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E (but not in the forbidden positions).
2. Does not contain S or T.
3. Uses other letters that are still possible (not ruled out yet).

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, etc. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. One possibility is ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since E was only forbidden from position 5).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was only forbidden from position 3).
- R is a new letter (not ruled out).
- L is in position 4 (allowed, since L was only forbidden from position 2).
- Y is a new letter (not ruled out).

This seems like a strong next guess as it places the known letters in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- L (but not in positions 2 or 4)
- A (but not in positions 3 or 2)
- E (but not in positions 5 or 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y

So far the confirmed letters are L, A, E, and they must appear in the remaining slots:
- E can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it’s not in 1 or 5)
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 2 or 3)
- L can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 2 or 4)

We need a 5-letter word that uses L, A, E exactly once each and two new letters that have not been tested yet. Good unused common letters are I, N, O, C, D, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places:
- E in position 2
- A in position 4
- L in position 1 or 3

Trying E in 2, A in 4, L in 3 gives: L _ E A _  
We need two more letters. Let’s pick I and N:  
Possible word: L I E A N → “LIEAN” (invalid, not a word)  
Swap to keep common endings: L E I A N → no.  

Try E in 2, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ _ A  
Then we need letters for positions 3 and 4. Try C and O: L C O E A → “LCOEA” (no).  
Try N and D: L N D E A → no.  

Try E in 3, A in 4, L in 1: L _ E A _  
Need letters 2 and 5. Try I and N: L I E A N → no.  
Try N and D: L N E A D → no.  

Try E in 4, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ E A  
Need letters 2 and 3. Try I and N: L I N E A → “LINEA” (no).  
Try C and O: L O C E A → no.  

Try L in 3, E in 2, A in 5: _ L E _ A  
Need letters 1 and 4. Try N and I: N L E I A → no.  
Try C and O: C L E O A → no.  

Try L in 5, E in 2, A in 4: _ _ E A L  
Need letters 1 and 2. Try N and I: N I E A L → no.  
Try C and O: C O E A L → no.  

Let’s look for real words. One that fits constraints is “CLEAN”:
- C, N are new letters.
- L is in position 2 (but L was only forbidden in 2 and 4, so this is invalid).

Next candidate: “PLANE”
- P is new.
- L is in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ELAND”
- E is in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “LEANT” (contains T, forbidden).

Next: “ALONE”
- A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ANELE” (not a word).

Next: “ELAIN” (not a word).

Next: “CLAVE”
- C new, V new.
- L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “CANOE”
- C, O new.
- A in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “COALE” (not a word).

Next: “ALOHE” (not a word).

Next: “PECAN”
- P, N new.
- E in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “ANEL” + one more letter.

Let me try “ALONE” again: A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ELAND”: E in 1 (forbidden).

Let me try “PLANE”: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ANELE”: not a word.

Let me try “NECKL” (invalid).

Let me try “CLEAT” (contains T, forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ALC E” (no).

Let me try “LAICE” (not a word).

Let me try “ELICA” (not a word).

Let me try “AELIC” (not a word).

Let me try “LEICA” (a real word):
- L is in 1 (allowed).
- E is in 2 (allowed).
- I, C are new.
- A is in 4 (allowed).

So “LEICA” fits all constraints:
- Contains L, A, E exactly once each.
- L not in 2 or 4 (it’s in 1).
- A not in 2 or 3 (it’s in 4).
- E not in 1 or 5 (it’s in 2).
- No S, T, R, Y.

This seems valid.

- A (still in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y, I, C

So far:
- Position 2 is E (✓)
- L must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1, 2, 4 are forbidden)
- A must be in position 1, 4 (since 2, 3, 5 are forbidden)

1. Has E in position 2
2. Has L in position 3 or 5
3. Has A in position 1 or 4
4. Uses two new letters (not S, T, R, Y, I, C)

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 1
Word pattern: A _ _ E _
L must be in position 3 or 5:
- A _ L E _ → need letters 2 and 5
  - Letters left: must be from unused {B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}
  - Try common consonants: A B L E N → “ABLEN” (no)
  - Try A N L E D → no
  - Try A L L E N → no (two L’s)
  - Try A D L E N → no
  - Try A N D E L → no
  - Try A M L E N → no
  - Try A N E L D → no
  - Try A N O E L → no
  - Try A N G E L → “ANGEL” (valid word)

Case 2: A in position 4
Word pattern: _ _ _ A E
L must be in position 3 or 5:
- _ _ L A E → need letters 1 and 2
  - Try B L A A E → no
  - Try N L A A E → no
  - Try M L A A E → no
  - Try B A L A E → no
  - Try N A L A E → no
  - Try M A L A E → no
  - Try B A M A E → no
  - No valid words found in this sub-case.

Thus the only valid word found is “ANGEL”.

Check constraints:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (S, T, R, Y, I, C)
- All letters used are either confirmed or new.

So the next guess is ANGEL.

- A in position 4
- L in position 1 or 3

Trying E in 2, A in 4, L in 3 gives: L _ E A _  
We need two more letters. Let’s pick I and N:  
Possible word: L I E A N → “LIEAN” (invalid, not a word)  
Swap to keep common endings: L E I A N → no.  

Try E in 2, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ _ A  
Then we need letters for positions 3 and 4. Try C and O: L C O E A → “LCOEA” (no).  
Try N and D: L N D E A → no.  

Try E in 3, A in 4, L in 1: L _ E A _  
Need letters 2 and 5. Try I and N: L I E A N → no.  
Try N and D: L N E A D → no.  

Try E in 4, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ E A  
Need letters 2 and 3. Try I and N: L I N E A → “LINEA” (no).  
Try C and O: L O C E A → no.  

Try L in 3, E in 2, A in 5: _ L E _ A  
Need letters 1 and 4. Try N and I: N L E I A → no.  
Try C and O: C L E O A → no.  

Try L in 5, E in 2, A in 4: _ _ E A L  
Need letters 1 and 2. Try N and I: N I E A L → no.  
Try C and O: C O E A L → no.  

Let’s look for real words. One that fits constraints is “CLEAN”:
- C, N are new letters.
- L is in position 2 (but L was only forbidden in 2 and 4, so this is invalid).

Next candidate: “PLANE”
- P is new.
- L is in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ELAND”
- E is in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “LEANT” (contains T, forbidden).

Next: “ALONE”
- A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ANELE” (not a word).

Next: “ELAIN” (not a word).

Next: “CLAVE”
- C new, V new.
- L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “CANOE”
- C, O new.
- A in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “COALE” (not a word).

Next: “ALOHE” (not a word).

Next: “PECAN”
- P, N new.
- E in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “ANEL” + one more letter.

Let me try “ALONE” again: A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ELAND”: E in 1 (forbidden).

Let me try “PLANE”: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ANELE”: not a word.

Let me try “NECKL” (invalid).

Let me try “CLEAT” (contains T, forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ALC E” (no).

Let me try “LAICE” (not a word).

Let me try “ELICA” (not a word).

Let me try “AELIC” (not a word).

Let me try “LEICA” (a real word):
- L is in 1 (allowed).
- E is in 2 (allowed).
- I, C are new.
- A is in 4 (allowed).

So “LEICA” fits all constraints:
- Contains L, A, E exactly once each.
- L not in 2 or 4 (it’s in 1).
- A not in 2 or 3 (it’s in 4).
- E not in 1 or 5 (it’s in 2).
- No S, T, R, Y.

This seems valid.

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- E (now known to be in position 2)
- L (still in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 4)
- A (still in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y, I, C

So far:
- Position 2 is E (✓)
- L must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1, 2, 4 are forbidden)
- A must be in position 1, 4 (since 2, 3, 5 are forbidden)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Has L in position 3 or 5
3. Has A in position 1 or 4
4. Uses two new letters (not S, T, R, Y, I, C)

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 1
Word pattern: A _ _ E _
L must be in position 3 or 5:
- A _ L E _ → need letters 2 and 5
  - Letters left: must be from unused {B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}
  - Try common consonants: A B L E N → “ABLEN” (no)
  - Try A N L E D → no
  - Try A L L E N → no (two L’s)
  - Try A D L E N → no
  - Try A N D E L → no
  - Try A M L E N → no
  - Try A N E L D → no
  - Try A N O E L → no
  - Try A N G E L → “ANGEL” (valid word)

Case 2: A in position 4
Word pattern: _ _ _ A E
L must be in position 3 or 5:
- _ _ L A E → need letters 1 and 2
  - Try B L A A E → no
  - Try N L A A E → no
  - Try M L A A E → no
  - Try B A L A E → no
  - Try N A L A E → no
  - Try M A L A E → no
  - Try B A M A E → no
  - No valid words found in this sub-case.

Thus the only valid word found is “ANGEL”.

Check constraints:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (S, T, R, Y, I, C)
- All letters used are either confirmed or new.

So the next guess is ANGEL.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most common and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives me good coverage of potential letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: L, A, E
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, T
- Positions to avoid for L, A, E: L≠2, A≠3, E≠5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E (but not in the forbidden positions).
2. Does not contain S or T.
3. Uses other letters that are still possible (not ruled out yet).

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, etc. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. One possibility is ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since E was only forbidden from position 5).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was only forbidden from position 3).
- R is a new letter (not ruled out).
- L is in position 4 (allowed, since L was only forbidden from position 2).
- Y is a new letter (not ruled out).

This seems like a strong next guess as it places the known letters in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- L (but not in positions 2 or 4)
- A (but not in positions 3 or 2)
- E (but not in positions 5 or 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y

So far the confirmed letters are L, A, E, and they must appear in the remaining slots:
- E can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it’s not in 1 or 5)
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 2 or 3)
- L can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 2 or 4)

We need a 5-letter word that uses L, A, E exactly once each and two new letters that have not been tested yet. Good unused common letters are I, N, O, C, D, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places:
- E in position 2
- A in position 4
- L in position 1 or 3

Trying E in 2, A in 4, L in 3 gives: L _ E A _  
We need two more letters. Let’s pick I and N:  
Possible word: L I E A N → “LIEAN” (invalid, not a word)  
Swap to keep common endings: L E I A N → no.  

Try E in 2, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ _ A  
Then we need letters for positions 3 and 4. Try C and O: L C O E A → “LCOEA” (no).  
Try N and D: L N D E A → no.  

Try E in 3, A in 4, L in 1: L _ E A _  
Need letters 2 and 5. Try I and N: L I E A N → no.  
Try N and D: L N E A D → no.  

Try E in 4, A in 5, L in 1: L _ _ E A  
Need letters 2 and 3. Try I and N: L I N E A → “LINEA” (no).  
Try C and O: L O C E A → no.  

Try L in 3, E in 2, A in 5: _ L E _ A  
Need letters 1 and 4. Try N and I: N L E I A → no.  
Try C and O: C L E O A → no.  

Try L in 5, E in 2, A in 4: _ _ E A L  
Need letters 1 and 2. Try N and I: N I E A L → no.  
Try C and O: C O E A L → no.  

Let’s look for real words. One that fits constraints is “CLEAN”:
- C, N are new letters.
- L is in position 2 (but L was only forbidden in 2 and 4, so this is invalid).

Next candidate: “PLANE”
- P is new.
- L is in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ELAND”
- E is in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “LEANT” (contains T, forbidden).

Next: “ALONE”
- A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “ANELE” (not a word).

Next: “ELAIN” (not a word).

Next: “CLAVE”
- C new, V new.
- L in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “CANOE”
- C, O new.
- A in 2 (forbidden).

Next: “COALE” (not a word).

Next: “ALOHE” (not a word).

Next: “PECAN”
- P, N new.
- E in 1 (forbidden).

Next: “ANEL” + one more letter.

Let me try “ALONE” again: A is in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ELAND”: E in 1 (forbidden).

Let me try “PLANE”: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ANELE”: not a word.

Let me try “NECKL” (invalid).

Let me try “CLEAT” (contains T, forbidden).

Let me try “CLEAN” again: L in 2 (forbidden).

Let me try “ALC E” (no).

Let me try “LAICE” (not a word).

Let me try “ELICA” (not a word).

Let me try “AELIC” (not a word).

Let me try “LEICA” (a real word):
- L is in 1 (allowed).
- E is in 2 (allowed).
- I, C are new.
- A is in 4 (allowed).

So “LEICA” fits all constraints:
- Contains L, A, E exactly once each.
- L not in 2 or 4 (it’s in 1).
- A not in 2 or 3 (it’s in 4).
- E not in 1 or 5 (it’s in 2).
- No S, T, R, Y.

This seems valid.

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- E (now known to be in position 2)
- L (still in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 4)
- A (still in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y, I, C

So far:
- Position 2 is E (✓)
- L must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1, 2, 4 are forbidden)
- A must be in position 1, 4 (since 2, 3, 5 are forbidden)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Has L in position 3 or 5
3. Has A in position 1 or 4
4. Uses two new letters (not S, T, R, Y, I, C)

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 1
Word pattern: A _ _ E _
L must be in position 3 or 5:
- A _ L E _ → need letters 2 and 5
  - Letters left: must be from unused {B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}
  - Try common consonants: A B L E N → “ABLEN” (no)
  - Try A N L E D → no
  - Try A L L E N → no (two L’s)
  - Try A D L E N → no
  - Try A N D E L → no
  - Try A M L E N → no
  - Try A N E L D → no
  - Try A N O E L → no
  - Try A N G E L → “ANGEL” (valid word)

Case 2: A in position 4
Word pattern: _ _ _ A E
L must be in position 3 or 5:
- _ _ L A E → need letters 1 and 2
  - Try B L A A E → no
  - Try N L A A E → no
  - Try M L A A E → no
  - Try B A L A E → no
  - Try N A L A E → no
  - Try M A L A E → no
  - Try B A M A E → no
  - No valid words found in this sub-case.

Thus the only valid word found is “ANGEL”.

Check constraints:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (S, T, R, Y, I, C)
- All letters used are either confirmed or new.

So the next guess is ANGEL.

From the four rounds we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- E (now known to be in position 2)
- L (now known to be in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, T, R, Y, I, C, N, G

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- A (must appear once, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5) → A must be in position 4.

So the word has the pattern:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the unused letters {B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}. These letters must form a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Position 3: same set

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ E _ A L.

Looking for common words:
- BEGAL (invalid)
- DEGAL (invalid)
- FERAL (valid word)
- HELAL (invalid)
- JERAL (invalid)
- KERAL (invalid)
- MERAL (invalid)
- PERAL (invalid)
- VERAL (invalid)

The only valid word found is ""FERAL"".

Check constraints:
- F and R: R is already ruled out (Guess 2 feedback), so FERAL is invalid.
Wait, R is already ruled out (R(x) in Guess 2), so FERAL is invalid.

Next possible word: ""WEDAL"" (invalid)
""PEDAL"" (invalid, D is unused but let's check)
""PEDAL"" - P, E, D, A, L - fits pattern _ E _ A L, uses P and D which are unused.

Is PEDAL a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are others:
""BEDAL"" (invalid)
""VEDAL"" (invalid)
""KEDAL"" (invalid)
""PEDAL"" (valid)
""ZEDAL"" (invalid)

Another approach: look for _ E _ A L words:
- ""CEDAL"" - C is ruled out
- ""G E _ A L"" - G is ruled out
- ""M E _ A L"" - ""MEAL"" is 4 letters, need 5
- ""P E _ A L"" - ""PEAL"" is 4 letters
- ""B E _ A L"" - ""BEAL"" is 4 letters

Actually, ""PEDAL"" is the clear candidate here.

But let's think again - is there a better fit? ""WEDAL"" is invalid, ""VEDAL"" is invalid, ""KEDAL"" is invalid.

Another word: ""B E D A L"" - ""BEDAL"" is not a word.
""F E D A L"" - ""FEDAL"" is not standard.
""F E M A L"" - ""FEMAL"" is not standard.
""F E O A L"" - ""FEOAL"" is not standard.

The only valid word fitting _ E _ A L is ""PEDAL"".

But wait - ""PEDAL"" uses D which is unused, and P which is unused. It fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is PEDAL.

From Guess 5 (PEDAL) we finally got:

P(x)  → P is NOT in the word  
E(✓)  → E is in the word AND in position 2  
D(✓)  → D is in the word AND in position 3  
A(✓)  → A is in the word AND in position 4  
L(✓)  → L is in the word AND in position 5  

Therefore, the secret word is completely determined:  
_  E  D  A  L

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out (from all guesses) include:  
S, T, R, Y, I, C, N, G, P

Unused letters that can occupy position 1 and are valid English letters:  
B, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form ? E D A L.

Valid dictionary words:  
F E D A L  → “FEDAL” (archaic but accepted; “FEDERAL” is 7 letters)  
B E D A L  → “BEDAL” (not a standard word)  
M E D A L  → “MEDAL” (valid)

“MEDAL” is the only common 5-letter word that fits.

Check constraints:  
- Starts with M (unused)  
- Exactly E D A L in positions 2-5  
- Uses no ruled-out letters  

Therefore the secret word must be MEDAL.
