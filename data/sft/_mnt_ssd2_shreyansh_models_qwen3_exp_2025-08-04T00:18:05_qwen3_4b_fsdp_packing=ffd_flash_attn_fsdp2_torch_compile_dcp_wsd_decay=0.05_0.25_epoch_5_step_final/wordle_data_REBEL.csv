### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us 5 distinct letters, all of which are among the most frequent in English, and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). This should provide good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains L and E, but not S, A, T.
- L is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Good letters to use next: L, E, plus common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U).

A strong second guess should:
1. Include L and E (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Place L and E in new positions to test their correct spots.
3. Use fresh, high-frequency consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- RELIC (R, E, L, I, C) – uses L in position 3, E in position 2.
- CLONE (C, L, O, N, E) – uses L in position 2 (but we already know L isn’t in position 2), so skip.
- ELBOW (E, L, B, O, W) – uses L in position 2 (again ruled out).

RELIC seems best: it places E in position 2 (new), L in position 3 (new), and brings in R, I, C (all common, not yet ruled out).
