1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, L, S).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to test multiple letters at once and narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can safely eliminate any word containing S, L, A, T, or E.

To make a good second guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses none of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. Contains other very common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain  
   → Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, etc.  
   → Common remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

A strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D — none of these letters were tested yet.
- It tests the very common vowel O and the consonants R, N, D.
- The letter U is also quite frequent in 5-letter words.

This should give us good coverage of still-untested letters to narrow down the possibilities.

From the two guesses we know:

Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, D  
Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: R (not in 1st position) and U (not in 3rd position)  
Letters we still don’t know about: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and U (since we know they’re in the word but misplaced)
2. Does **not** contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, D
3. Has R in a position other than 1st and U in a position other than 3rd

Let’s list possible placements:
- R can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- U can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

A quick scan of common 5-letter words meeting these constraints gives “CURIO”, but I is already unused and O is eliminated.  
Another candidate: “BRICK” – B, R, I, C, K. This uses R and I (I is still possible), and avoids all eliminated letters.  
But we need to confirm U is present.  
Wait – we must include both R and U.

Let’s try “URBID” – but D is eliminated.  
“PURIM” – M is possible, but I is still possible.  
“CURVY” – Y is possible, but V is possible.  
“FURRY” – F, U, R, R, Y. This uses F, U, R, R, Y. All letters are still possible except R and U which we know are in the word.  
But we don’t know if F or Y are in the word yet.  
A safer choice is “CURVY” – C, U, R, V, Y. It includes U and R and only uses still-possible letters.

However, we might prefer a word that uses more common remaining letters.  
“BURNT” – but N and T are eliminated.  
“CRUMP” – C, R, U, M, P. This uses C, R, U, M, P. All letters are still possible except R and U which we know are in the word.  
This seems like a strong candidate.

Let me verify:
- C: not tested
- R: known to be in word, position 2 here (not 1st, so allowed)
- U: known to be in word, position 3 here (but earlier U was in position 3 and marked wrong, so this is invalid)

Oops – U cannot be in position 3.  
So “CRUMP” is invalid because U would be in position 3 again.

Let’s rethink with U not in position 3 and R not in position 1.

Possible structure: _ R _ U _ or _ _ R _ U etc.

A good candidate is “CURVY”:
- C: possible
- U: position 2 (allowed, since previous U was in 3)
- R: position 3 (allowed, since previous R was in 1)
- V: possible
- Y: possible

This satisfies all constraints.

However, we might prefer a word that uses more common remaining letters.  
“BURNT” – but N and T are eliminated.  
“CRUMP” – C, R, U, M, P. This uses C, R, U, M, P. All letters are still possible except R and U which we know are in the word.  
This seems like a strong candidate.

Let me verify:
- C: not tested
- R: known to be in word, position 2 here (not 1st, so allowed)
- U: known to be in word, position 3 here (but earlier U was in position 3 and marked wrong, so this is invalid)

Oops – U cannot be in position 3.  
So “CRUMP” is invalid because U would be in position 3 again.

Let’s rethink with U not in position 3 and R not in position 1.

Possible structure: _ R _ U _ or _ _ R _ U etc.

A good candidate is “CURVY”:
- C: possible
- U: position 2 (allowed, since previous U was in 3)
- R: position 3 (allowed, since previous R was in 1)
- V: possible
- Y: possible

This satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, D, C, V, Y  
- Letters known to be in the word: U (position 2 is correct) and R (must appear, but not in position 1 and not in position 3)  
- So far the pattern is: _ U _ _ _

R must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
But position 2 is already U, so R must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Z  
We need a common 5-letter word that fits _ U _ _ _, contains R in position 4 or 5, and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible options:
- _ U _ R _ : e.g., BURK? (invalid, K is possible, but BURK is too short)
- _ U _ _ R : e.g., FUMER? (invalid, M, E, R – E is eliminated)
- _ U _ _ R : e.g., PUKER? (invalid, E is eliminated)
- _ U _ R _ : e.g., HURL? (invalid, L is eliminated)
- _ U _ _ R : e.g., MURDR? (invalid, D is eliminated)

Looking at valid words:
- ""BURNT"" – N, T eliminated
- ""FUROR"" – O, R already eliminated O
- ""HURRY"" – H, Y, R – Y eliminated
- ""MURKY"" – Y eliminated
- ""PURIM"" – I, M – but U is already in position 2
- ""QUIRK"" – Q, I, K – but R must be in 4 or 5
- ""BURKE"" – E eliminated
- ""FURRY"" – Y eliminated
- ""HURUL"" – L eliminated
- ""MURRA"" – A eliminated
- ""PURRY"" – Y eliminated
- ""QUIRR"" – invalid
- ""BURRS"" – S eliminated
- ""FURRS"" – S eliminated
- ""HURRS"" – S eliminated
- ""MURRS"" – S eliminated
- ""PURRS"" – S eliminated
- ""QUURS"" – invalid

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ U _ _ _, contain R in position 4 or 5, and use remaining letters.

Possible words:
- ""BURK"" – too short
- ""FURR"" – too short
- ""HURD"" – D eliminated
- ""MURR"" – too short
- ""PURR"" – too short
- ""QUIR"" – too short
- ""BURR"" – too short
- ""FURR"" – too short
- ""HURR"" – too short
- ""MURR"" – too short
- ""PURR"" – too short
- ""QUIR"" – too short

This suggests I might have missed some. Let me list valid 5-letter words with U in position 2, R in position 4 or 5, and no eliminated letters.

Valid words:
- ""BURKE"" – E eliminated
- ""FUROR"" – O eliminated

Actually, ""QUIRK"" is Q U I R K – this fits:
- _ U _ _ _ : Q U I R K
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- U is in position 2 (correct)
- Letters used: Q, U, I, R, K – none are eliminated
