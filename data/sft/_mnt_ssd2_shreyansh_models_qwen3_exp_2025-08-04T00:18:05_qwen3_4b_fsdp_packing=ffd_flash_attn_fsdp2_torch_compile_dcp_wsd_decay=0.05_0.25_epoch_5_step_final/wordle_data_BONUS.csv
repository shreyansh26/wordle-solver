For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.

- O(-) → O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word, but not in position 4.

- Contains O and S.
- Does not contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S.

Good candidate letters (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong second guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, I, N are new letters.
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since it cannot be in position 3).
- S is not in this guess (we need to test another position for S later).

But we still need to confirm where S goes. Another candidate is “SOILS”, but it repeats S and may not test new letters effectively.

A better choice is “FOIST”:
- F, I, T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “STOIC”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, C are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems valid:
- Contains S and O.
- Does not contain A, R, E.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common starting letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: most common letter in English
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
From both guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
Exact positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from arose) or position 3 (from stoic) – same rule reinforced.
- S cannot be in position 4 (from arose) or position 1 (from stoic) – so S must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains both O and S.
- Excludes A, R, E, T, I, C.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.

Remaining candidate letters (besides O and S): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and O in position 5:  
Pattern: _ S _ _ O  
Filling with new letters: D, L, N, B → “DSNBO” is not a valid English word.  
Try “B S _ _ O”: “BSHOT” contains H and T, but T is excluded.  
Try “P S _ _ O”: “PSHOT” contains T.  
Try “F S _ _ O”: “FSKOW” – not valid.  
Try “S in position 5, O in position 2”:  
Pattern: _ O _ _ S  
Example: “D O U B S” – not valid.  
“P O U L S” – not valid.  
“M O U N S” – “MOUNTS” is valid, uses M, U, N, and avoids all excluded letters.

Check constraints:
- Contains O (position 2) and S (position 5).
- Excludes A, R, E, T, I, C.
- O is not in position 3 – good.
- S is not in positions 1 or 4 – good.

“MOUNTS” fits all requirements.

The feedback on “mounts” says “Model answer is not five letters,” so “mounts” is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this puzzle.  
I need to pick a valid 5-letter word that still satisfies all the constraints we’ve gathered so far:

Letters known to be in the word: O, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in position 3 (already confirmed twice).
- S cannot be in positions 1 (from stoic) or 4 (from arose).

So S must be in position 2 or 5.  
O must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Let’s try S in position 2 and O in position 5:  
Pattern: _ S _ _ O  
Filling with remaining valid letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z):  
“D S _ _ O” → “DSHOT” contains T (invalid).  
“B S _ _ O” → “BSHOT” contains T.  
“F S _ _ O” → “FSKOW” – not a word.  
“N S _ _ O” → “NSHOT” – invalid.  

Now try S in position 5 and O in position 2:  
Pattern: _ O _ _ S  
Example: “B O U L S” – not a word.  
“D O U B S” – not a word.  
“P O U L S” – not a word.  
“M O U N S” – already tried (invalid).  
“D O U B S” – invalid.  

Let’s look for a word that places O in position 4 and S in position 2:  
Pattern: _ S _ O _  
Example: “B S _ O _” → “BSHOT” – T is out.  
“D S _ O _” → “D S K O _” – not a word.  

Another pattern: S in position 5, O in position 4:  
Pattern: _ _ _ O S  
Example: “B U D O S” – not a word.  
“F U D O S” – not a word.  

Let me list valid 5-letter words that contain both O and S, exclude A, R, E, T, I, C, and satisfy the position constraints.

One such word is “FOSSA” – but A is excluded.  
“BOSSA” – A excluded.  
“DUSKO” – S must be present.  
“MUSKO” – S must be present.  
“DUSKS” – S is in position 5, O in position 4 – valid letters, but is it a word? Yes, “DUSKS” is valid.

Check constraints:
- Contains O (position 4) and S (position 5).
- Excludes A, R, E, T, I, C.
- O not in position 3 – good.
- S not in positions 1 or 4 – good (it’s in 5).

“DUSKS” fits perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common starting letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: most common letter in English
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does not contain A, R, or E.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S.
2. Does not use A, R, or E.
3. O is not in position 3.
4. S is not in position 4.

Good candidate letters (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong second guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, I, N are new letters.
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since it cannot be in position 3).
- S is not in this guess (we need to test another position for S later).

But we still need to confirm where S goes. Another candidate is “SOILS”, but it repeats S and may not test new letters effectively.

A better choice is “FOIST”:
- F, I, T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “STOIC”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, C are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems valid:
- Contains S and O.
- Does not contain A, R, E.
- O not in position 3.
- S not in position 4.

Let’s go with “STOIC”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Known letters:
- O is in the word (from arose and stoic)
- S is in the word (from arose and dusks)
- S is in the correct position 5 (✓ at the end from dusks)
- U is in the word but not in position 2 (from dusks: U(-))
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C, D, K

So the word ends in S and contains O and U somewhere in positions 1-4, with O not in position 3 and U not in position 2.

Remaining candidate letters (besides O, U, S): B, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in S that includes both O and U, uses only the allowed letters, and satisfies the positional constraints.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ _ S
- Must contain O and U, with O ≠ pos 3, U ≠ pos 2.

Let’s brainstorm words ending in S:
- FOCUS – contains C (invalid)
- MOUNT – contains T (invalid)
- BONUS – ends in S, contains O and U, letters B, O, N, U, S – all allowed, and positions: O in 2, U in 4 – both satisfy constraints (O not in 3, U not in 2).

Check BONUS:
- B, O, N, U, S – all allowed letters
- Ends in S (position 5)
- Contains O (position 2) and U (position 4)
- O is not in position 3 – good
- U is not in position 2 – good

This seems to fit all constraints.
