### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll create a word using as many of these common letters as possible, while ensuring it's a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends with S and contains none of A, R, O, E.

Letters still possible (common ones): T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

I want a new guess that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidates ending in S:
- T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V

I’ll pick a word that combines several of these. “HINTS” uses H, I, N, T, S – all still possible letters and gives good coverage.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  
   – I, N, T are not in the word.  
   – S appears in the 5th position in both guesses, yet the feedback for hints shows S(-), which is puzzling because we already have S(✓) in the 5th position. This suggests that the feedback system is indicating that S is in the word but not in the 5th position in the hints guess, which contradicts the first feedback. However, since the first feedback clearly states S is in the correct position (5th), we will take that as absolute and assume the second feedback for S is an error or misinterpretation. We’ll proceed with S confirmed in the 5th spot.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: H _ _ _ S
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, T
- Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word starting with H and ending with S, using only the remaining possible letters. Good candidates:
- HUMPS – but P and U are possible, but M is possible too. However, HUMPS has 5 letters: H-U-M-P-S. All letters are possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll create a word using as many of these common letters as possible, while ensuring it's a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends with S and contains none of A, R, O, E.

Letters still possible (common ones): T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

I want a new guess that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidates ending in S:
- T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V

I’ll pick a word that combines several of these. “HINTS” uses H, I, N, T, S – all still possible letters and gives good coverage.

From the two guesses we have:

   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, T
- Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

From the four guesses we now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  
   – I, N, T are not in the word.  
   – S appears in the 5th position in both guesses, yet the feedback for hints shows S(-), which is contradictory. We will treat the first feedback as absolute (S is definitely in 5th position) and assume the second feedback for S is an error.

3. humps → H(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is confirmed in 1st position.  
   – U is confirmed in 2nd position.  
   – M and P are not in the word.  
   – Again, S(-) appears, but we already know S is in 5th position, so we will disregard this.

4. hulks → H(✓) U(✓) L(x) K(x) S(-)  
   – H is confirmed in 1st position.  
   – U is confirmed in 2nd position.  
   – L and K are not in the word.  
   – S(-) appears once more, but we already know S is in 5th position, so we will disregard this.

So the word is H U _ _ S, and the letters not in the word include: A, R, O, E, I, N, T, M, P, L, K.

Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word starting with H U and ending with S, using only the remaining letters. Possible candidates:
- HUCKS – but K is excluded.
- HUGES – but E is excluded.
- HUMPS – but M, P are excluded.
- HULKS – but L, K are excluded.
- HUSKS – but K is excluded.
- HUBBS – but B is possible, but we need 5 letters starting with H U _ _ S.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- HUBBS – but B is possible, but we need 5 letters starting with H U _ _ S.
- HUGGS – but G is possible, but we need 5 letters starting with H U _ _ S.

Looking at the pattern H U _ _ S, the only common word left seems to be HUGES, but E is excluded. 

Wait, let's think of other combinations:
- H U B _ S – but B is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y). Possible words: HUBBS, but that's H U B B S – B is allowed.
- H U C _ S – but C is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters. Possible words: HUCYS – but not a valid word.
- H U D _ S – but D is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters. Possible words: HUDIS – but not ending with S.
- H U G _ S – G is possible, possible words: HUGES (E excluded), HUGGS (G is allowed, but S is already in 5th position).
- H U V _ S – V is possible, possible words: HUVIS – not valid.
- H U W _ S – W is possible, possible words: HUWES – not valid.
- H U Y _ S – Y is possible, possible words: HUYDS – not valid.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with HU and ending with S, the only one left seems to be HUGES, but E is excluded. 

But wait, we have not used D, F, G, V, W, Y yet. Let me think of other possibilities:
- HUBBS – H U B B S – B is allowed, but is HUBBS a valid word? It's a plural of hub, but may not be accepted.
- HUGGS – H U G G S – G is allowed, but is HUGGS a valid word? It's a brand name, but may not be accepted.
- HUVIS – not valid.
- HUGES – invalid because E is excluded.

Looking back at the letters, we have not used D, F, V, W, Y yet. 

Possible words:
- HUBBS – acceptable if plural is allowed.
- HUGGS – acceptable if brand name is allowed.
- HUVIS – invalid.
- HUGES – invalid.

But let's think of other combinations:
- H U D _ S – but D is possible, but what's the 4th letter? From remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y. 
- H U D B S – not valid.
- H U D G S – HUDGS – not valid.
- H U F _ S – H U F _ S – but F is possible, but what's the 4th letter? From remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y. 
- H U F F S – not valid.
- H U G _ S – HUGES invalid, HUGGS acceptable if allowed.
- H U V _ S – HUVIS invalid.
- H U W _ S – HUWES invalid.
- H U Y _ S – HUYDS invalid.

Given the constraints, the most likely valid word is HUGGS, even though it's a brand name, or HUBBS if plural is allowed. 

But looking at common 5-letter words starting with HU and ending with S, and considering the letters left, the only possible word seems to be HUGES, but E is excluded. 

Wait, let me re-examine the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- HUBBS – H U B B S – valid as a plural of hub.
- HUGGS – H U G G S – valid as a brand name.
- HUVIS – invalid.
- HUGES – invalid.
- HUDIS – invalid.

Between these, HUBBS seems more likely as a valid word.

But let me check if there are others:
- HUCYS – invalid.
- HUDDY – not ending with S.
- HUFFY – not ending with S.

It seems HUBBS is the closest valid word left.

But wait, let me think of HUGGS as a possible guess.

Given the constraints, the most reasonable guesses are HUBBS or HUGGS. 

Between these, HUGGS uses G which is still allowed, and is more common as a word (brand name), but HUBBS is also acceptable.

However, let me think if there are other combinations:
- H U B C S – not valid.
- H U B D S – not valid.
- H U C _ S – HUCYS invalid.
- H U D _ S – HUDIS invalid.
- H U F _ S – HUFFS – but F is possible, but is HUFFS a valid word? Yes, HUFFS is a valid word (third person singular of huff).

HUFFS – H U F F S – uses F twice, which is allowed, and is a valid word.

This seems like the best option as it's a common word using remaining letters.

</think>

From the feedback, we know the word starts with H U and ends with S, and the letters not in the word include A, R, O, E, I, N, T, M, P, L, K. The remaining possible letters are B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y.

The most common valid word fitting H U _ _ S with these constraints is HUFFS.

<guess>huffs</guess>",huffs,"From the four guesses we now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  
   – I, N, T are not in the word.  
   – S appears in the 5th position in both guesses, yet the feedback for hints shows S(-), which is contradictory. We will treat the first feedback as absolute (S is definitely in 5th position) and assume the second feedback for S is an error.

3. humps → H(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is confirmed in 1st position.  
   – U is confirmed in 2nd position.  
   – M and P are not in the word.  
   – Again, S(-) appears, but we already know S is in 5th position, so we will disregard this.

4. hulks → H(✓) U(✓) L(x) K(x) S(-)  
   – H is confirmed in 1st position.  
   – U is confirmed in 2nd position.  
   – L and K are not in the word.  
   – S(-) appears once more, but we already know S is in 5th position, so we will disregard this.

So the word is H U _ _ S, and the letters not in the word include: A, R, O, E, I, N, T, M, P, L, K.

Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word starting with H U and ending with S, using only the remaining letters. Possible candidates:
- HUCKS – but K is excluded.
- HUGES – but E is excluded.
- HUMPS – but M, P are excluded.
- HULKS – but L, K are excluded.
- HUSKS – but K is excluded.
- HUBBS – but B is possible, but we need 5 letters starting with H U _ _ S.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- HUBBS – but B is possible, but we need 5 letters starting with H U _ _ S.
- HUGGS – but G is possible, but we need 5 letters starting with H U _ _ S.

Looking at the pattern H U _ _ S, the only common word left seems to be HUGES, but E is excluded. 

Wait, let's think of other combinations:
- H U B _ S – but B is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y). Possible words: HUBBS, but that's H U B B S – B is allowed.
- H U C _ S – but C is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters. Possible words: HUCYS – but not a valid word.
- H U D _ S – but D is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters. Possible words: HUDIS – but not ending with S.
- H U G _ S – G is possible, possible words: HUGES (E excluded), HUGGS (G is allowed, but S is already in 5th position).
- H U V _ S – V is possible, possible words: HUVIS – not valid.
- H U W _ S – W is possible, possible words: HUWES – not valid.
- H U Y _ S – Y is possible, possible words: HUYDS – not valid.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with HU and ending with S, the only one left seems to be HUGES, but E is excluded. 

But wait, we have not used D, F, G, V, W, Y yet. Let me think of other possibilities:
- HUBBS – H U B B S – B is allowed, but is HUBBS a valid word? It's a plural of hub, but may not be accepted.
- HUGGS – H U G G S – G is allowed, but is HUGGS a valid word? It's a brand name, but may not be accepted.
- HUVIS – not valid.
- HUGES – invalid because E is excluded.

Looking back at the letters, we have not used D, F, V, W, Y yet. 

Possible words:
- HUBBS – acceptable if plural is allowed.
- HUGGS – acceptable if brand name is allowed.
- HUVIS – invalid.
- HUGES – invalid.

But let's think of other combinations:
- H U D _ S – but D is possible, but what's the 4th letter? From remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y. 
- H U D B S – not valid.
- H U D G S – HUDGS – not valid.
- H U F _ S – H U F _ S – but F is possible, but what's the 4th letter? From remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y. 
- H U F F S – not valid.
- H U G _ S – HUGES invalid, HUGGS acceptable if allowed.
- H U V _ S – HUVIS invalid.
- H U W _ S – HUWES invalid.
- H U Y _ S – HUYDS invalid.

Given the constraints, the most likely valid word is HUGGS, even though it's a brand name, or HUBBS if plural is allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll create a word using as many of these common letters as possible, while ensuring it's a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends with S and contains none of A, R, O, E.

Letters still possible (common ones): T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

I want a new guess that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidates ending in S:
- T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V

I’ll pick a word that combines several of these. “HINTS” uses H, I, N, T, S – all still possible letters and gives good coverage.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  
   – I, N, T are not in the word.  
   – S appears in the 5th position in both guesses, yet the feedback for hints shows S(-), which is puzzling because we already have S(✓) in the 5th position. This suggests that the feedback system is indicating that S is in the word but not in the 5th position in the hints guess, which contradicts the first feedback. However, since the first feedback clearly states S is in the correct position (5th), we will take that as absolute and assume the second feedback for S is an error or misinterpretation. We’ll proceed with S confirmed in the 5th spot.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: H _ _ _ S
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, T
- Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word starting with H and ending with S, using only the remaining possible letters. Good candidates:
- HUMPS – but P and U are possible, but M is possible too. However, HUMPS has 5 letters: H-U-M-P-S. All letters are possible.
- HUMPS seems like a good choice as it uses common remaining letters (U, M, P) and fits the pattern H _ _ _ S.

Let’s go with HUMPS.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  
   – I, N, T are not in the word.  
   – S appears in the 5th position in both guesses, yet the feedback for hints shows S(-), which is contradictory. We will treat the first feedback as absolute (S is definitely in 5th position) and assume the second feedback for S is an error.

   – M and P are not in the word.  
   – Again, S(-) appears, but we already know S is in 5th position, so we will disregard this and treat the pattern as H U _ _ S.

So the word is H U _ _ S, and the letters not in the word include: A, R, O, E, I, N, T, M, P.

Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word starting with H U and ending with S, using only the remaining letters. Possible candidates:
- HUCKS – but C and K are possible, but U is already used.
- HUGES – but E is excluded.
- HULKS – L and K are possible.
- HUMPS – already tried (M, P excluded).
- HUSKS – S is already used in 5th position.

Looking at the remaining letters, L and K are possible. ""HULKS"" seems like a good choice as it uses L and K which are still allowed.

H U L K S – all letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

Wait, let's think of other combinations:
- H U B _ S – but B is possible, but we need 4th letter from remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, V, W, Y). Possible words: HUBBS, but that's H U B B S – B is allowed.

We’ll proceed with S confirmed in the 5th spot.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Word pattern: H _ _ _ S\n- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, T\n- Still possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y\n\nWe need a 5-letter word starting with H and ending with S, using only the remaining possible letters. Good candidates:\n- HUMPS – but P and U are possible, but M is possible too. However, HUMPS has 5 letters: H-U-M-P-S. All letters are possible.\n- HUMPS seems like a good choice as it uses common remaining letters (U, M, P) and fits the pattern H _ _ _ S.\n\nLet’s go with HUMPS.\n\n<guess>humps</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: hints -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: humps -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the three guesses we now know:\n\n1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  \n   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  \n   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.\n\n2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  \n   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  \n   – I, N, T are not in the word.  \n   – S appears in the 5th position in both guesses, yet the feedback for hints shows S(-), which is contradictory.

Yes, HUFFS is a valid word (third person singular of huff).\n\nHUFFS – H U F F S – uses F twice, which is allowed, and is a valid word.\n\nThis seems like the best option as it's a common word using remaining letters.From the feedback, we know the word starts with H U and ends with S, and the letters not in the word include A, R, O, E, I, N, T, M, P, L, K.

From the five guesses we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct and in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. hints → H(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct and in the 1st position.  
   – I, N, T are not in the word.  

3. humps → H(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – U is confirmed in the 2nd position.  
   – M, P are not in the word.  

4. hulks → H(✓) U(✓) L(x) K(x) S(-)  
   – L, K are not in the word.  

5. huffs → H(✓) U(✓) F(x) F(x) S(-)  
   – F is not in the word.

So the pattern is H U _ _ S and the letters NOT in the word include:
A, R, O, E, I, N, T, M, P, L, K, F.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, G, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word starting with H U and ending with S, using only these remaining letters.  
Possible candidates:
- HUG**?**S: G is allowed, but we need two middle letters from B, C, D, G, V, W, Y.  
  – HUGBS – not valid.  
  – HUGCS – not valid.  
  – HUGDS – not valid.  
  – HUGGS – valid (though informal).  
- HUB**?**S: B is allowed, but we need two middle letters.  
  – HUBBS – valid (plural of hub).  

Between HUGGS and HUBBS, HUBBS is more common as a word.  
Therefore, I will guess HUBBS.
