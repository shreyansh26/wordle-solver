### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage to potentially hit letters in the secret word and narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Current known facts:
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters confirmed in the word: O (in the correct position 2) and D (in the word but not in position 5)

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ _ _
And the letters we still need to test among common ones are: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y plus the D which we know is somewhere in positions 1,3,4 or 5.

From the feedback, D is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in 1,3, or 4.

A good next word should:
1. Keep O in position 2
2. Include D in one of positions 1,3,4
3. Use new common letters to maximize information

Looking at possibilities:
- If D is in position 1: DO _ _ _
- If D is in position 3: _ O D _ _
- If D is in position 4: _ O _ D _

Testing D in position 1 with common remaining letters: D, O, and then maybe C, H, I, K, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""DOCHI"" but that's not a valid English word. 
""DOMIC"" isn't valid either. 
""DOLIC"" isn't valid. 

A valid word with D in position 1 is ""DOGIC"" but that's not valid. 

Looking for valid words:
- ""DOCKY"" - but Y is less common
- ""DOPIE"" - but E is ruled out
- ""DOPIN"" - N is ruled out
- ""DOWIC"" - not valid
- ""DOWPY"" - not valid

Actually, ""DOUGH"" is valid but uses U which is ruled out.

Better approach: use D in position 3 or 4 with new letters.

Trying D in position 3: _ O D _ _
Possible: ""CODON"" - but N is ruled out
""FOCOD"" - not valid
""PODGY"" - G,Y are new
""PODGY"" is valid.

But let's check: P, O, D, G, Y - all new except O and D which we know.

But D is in position 3 here, which is allowed.

Alternatively, D in position 4: _ O _ D _
Possible: ""COBID"" - not valid
""FOBID"" - not valid
""POBID"" - not valid
""COMID"" - not valid
""CONID"" - N is ruled out
""COUID"" - U is ruled out

""D"" in position 1 seems better with ""DOGIC"" invalid, but ""DOCKY"" is invalid as well.

Wait, ""DOUGH"" is invalid due to U.

Looking again, ""DOPEY"" - E is ruled out.

""D"" in position 1 with valid words:
- ""DOGSY"" - S is ruled out
- ""DOUGH"" - U is ruled out
- ""DOZER"" - Z,R are new but R is ruled out

Hmm, maybe D in position 4:
""COBID"" invalid
""FOBID"" invalid
""POBID"" invalid

""D"" in position 3:
""CODON"" invalid
""FOCOD"" invalid
""PODGY"" valid

""PODGY"" uses P, O, D, G, Y - all new except O and D which we know. D is in position 3 which is allowed.

This seems the best option.

Alternatively, ""COFFY"" - but D is not included.

But we know D is in the word, so we must include D.

Thus, ""PODGY"" is the best next guess.

This seems the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

""DOMIC"" isn't valid either. 
""DOLIC"" isn't valid. 

A valid word with D in position 1 is ""DOGIC"" but that's not valid. 

Looking for valid words:
- ""DOCKY"" - but Y is less common
- ""DOPIE"" - but E is ruled out
- ""DOPIN"" - N is ruled out
- ""DOWIC"" - not valid
- ""DOWPY"" - not valid

Actually, ""DOUGH"" is valid but uses U which is ruled out.

Better approach: use D in position 3 or 4 with new letters.

Trying D in position 3: _ O D _ _
Possible: ""CODON"" - but N is ruled out
""FOCOD"" - not valid
""PODGY"" - G,Y are new
""PODGY"" is valid.

But let's check: P, O, D, G, Y - all new except O and D which we know.

But D is in position 3 here, which is allowed.

Alternatively, D in position 4: _ O _ D _
Possible: ""COBID"" - not valid
""FOBID"" - not valid
""POBID"" - not valid
""COMID"" - not valid
""CONID"" - N is ruled out
""COUID"" - U is ruled out

""D"" in position 1 seems better with ""DOGIC"" invalid, but ""DOCKY"" is invalid as well.

Wait, ""DOUGH"" is invalid due to U.

Looking again, ""DOPEY"" - E is ruled out.

""D"" in position 1 with valid words:
- ""DOGSY"" - S is ruled out
- ""DOUGH"" - U is ruled out
- ""DOZER"" - Z,R are new but R is ruled out

Hmm, maybe D in position 4:
""COBID"" invalid
""FOBID"" invalid
""POBID"" invalid

""D"" in position 3:
""CODON"" invalid
""FOCOD"" invalid
""PODGY"" valid

""PODGY"" uses P, O, D, G, Y - all new except O and D which we know. D is in position 3 which is allowed.

This seems the best option.

Alternatively, ""COFFY"" - but D is not included.

But we know D is in the word, so we must include D.

Thus, ""PODGY"" is the best next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word with D in position 1 or 4.

""D"" in position 1:
""DOGIC"" invalid
""DOCKY"" invalid
""DOZER"" - Z,R invalid

""D"" in position 4:
""COBID"" invalid
""FOBID"" invalid
""POBID"" invalid
""COMID"" invalid
""CONID"" invalid
""COUID"" invalid

""D"" in position 3:
""CODON"" invalid
""FOCOD"" invalid
""PODGY"" valid

Thus, ""PODGY"" is the best valid word.

But let me check ""PODGY"" - P, O, D, G, Y - all new except O and D which we know. D is in position 3 which is allowed.

This seems the best next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2
- D is confirmed in the word but not in position 5
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N

I need a word that keeps O in position 2, includes D somewhere (positions 1,3,4), and uses new common letters. A valid word fitting these constraints is ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y).

From PODGY:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage to potentially hit letters in the secret word and narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the answer contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.

For the second guess, I need a fresh set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, H, M, B, G, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U.

A balanced word that uses several of these is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none of these were guessed before, and they’re all fairly common.

This should give good information for the third guess.

Thus, the best next guess is ""DOCHY"".Based on the feedback:
- O is fixed in position 2
- Y is fixed in position 5
- D is confirmed in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5, so it must be in position 1
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G

The pattern is now D O _ _ Y. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern with unused letters is ""DOCHY"".

From the latest feedback:

- Pattern is _ O _ _ Y (O in position 2, Y in position 5).
- D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE: not 5; from PODGY: not 3; from DOCHY: not 1).  
  The only remaining position for D is 2, but position 2 is already O.  
  This contradiction means my earlier interpretation was wrong.

Re-examine the feedback carefully:

1. SLATE: D(-) in position 5 → D is not in position 5.
2. PODGY: D(-) in position 3 → D is not in position 3.
3. DOCHY: D(-) in position 1 → D is not in position 1.

Thus, D cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
The only remaining position is 2, but position 2 is O.  
This implies no valid placement for D, which is impossible.  
Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as ""D is in the word but not in the tested positions,"" not necessarily excluding all those positions.

Revised understanding:
- From SLATE: D is not in position 5.
- From PODGY: D is not in position 3.
- From DOCHY: D is not in position 1.

Thus, D must be in position 4 (the only remaining possible position).

So the pattern is _ O _ D Y.

Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G, C, H.

Remaining consonants to test: B, F, K, M, V, W, etc.

Possible valid words fitting _ O _ D Y:
- BOBDY – invalid
- FOBFY – invalid
- MOODY – M, O, O, D, Y – but O is already in position 2, so MOODY would have O in position 2 and 3, which is allowed.
- FOKDY – invalid
- VOGDY – invalid

The valid word is ""MOODY"".

Check letters:
- M: not ruled out
- O: already confirmed in position 2
- O: second O is allowed
- D: must be in position 4
- Y: confirmed in position 5

Thus, ""MOODY"" fits all constraints.
