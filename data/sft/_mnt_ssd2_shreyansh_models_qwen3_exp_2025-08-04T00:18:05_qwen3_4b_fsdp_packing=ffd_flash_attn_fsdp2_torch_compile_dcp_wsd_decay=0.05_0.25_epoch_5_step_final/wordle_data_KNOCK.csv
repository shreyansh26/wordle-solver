### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is fixed).

I’ll try a word that uses I and U plus some of those consonants. “POINT” uses P, I, N, T and keeps O in the correct spot. It avoids all the letters we know are absent.

Let's process the new feedback on “point”:

- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (contradicts previous feedback).  
  Wait: earlier feedback said O(✓) in 3rd position for “arose”.  
  This new feedback says O(-) in 2nd position.  
  That’s impossible unless the feedback system is mis-typed.  
  Interpreting the feedback literally:  
  – From arose: O is correct in 3rd position.  
  – From point: O is in word but wrong position (2nd).  
  These two facts are incompatible.  
  Therefore, the feedback for point must be:  
  O(-) means O is in word but NOT in 2nd position.  
  But 3rd position is already locked.  
  So O cannot be anywhere, which contradicts O being in word.  
  The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for point is:  
  O(-) means O is in word but NOT in 2nd position (so still 3rd is correct).  
  Therefore, the word has O in 3rd position, and other letters avoid A,R,S,E,P,I,T.

So pattern is: _ _ O _ _

Letters known absent: A,R,S,E,P,I,T  
Remaining common consonants: N,L,C,D,M,V,K,Y,H,G,B,F,U,W,Z,X,Q,J  
Remaining vowels: U (O is fixed in 3rd)

From point feedback: N(-) → N is in word but not in 4th position.

So word has:
- O in 3rd
- N somewhere else (positions 1,2, or 5)
- Avoid A,R,S,E,P,I,T

I need a word with O in 3rd, N somewhere, and no forbidden letters.  
Good candidates:  
- M O N D O (but O repeats)  
- B O N N Y (but N repeats)  
- C O N C Y (but C,Y)  
- D O N N Y (double N)  
- G O N N Y (double N)  
- H O N N Y (double N)  
- L O N D O (double O)  
- M O N D A (A forbidden)  
- B O N N Y, C O N C Y, D O N N Y, etc.

“CONNY” is a valid word (variant spelling of “connie”), has O in 3rd, N in 2nd and 5th, and avoids all forbidden letters.

Let's carefully parse the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - A, R, S, E are not in the word.

2. point → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(-) T(x)
   - P, I, T are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the position shown (2nd letter), but we already know from #1 it must be in 3rd, so this is consistent.
   - N is in the word but NOT in the position shown (4th letter).

3. donny → D(x) O(-) N(-) N(-) Y(x)
   - D, Y are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the position shown (2nd letter) – again consistent with O being in 3rd.
   - First N (3rd letter) is in the word but NOT in the position shown (3rd letter) – wait, that’s impossible because we know O is in 3rd letter from #1. This suggests the first N in donny is actually in 3rd position, but feedback says N(-) meaning N is in word but wrong position. This contradicts our known O in 3rd. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
     - The first N in donny is in 3rd position (same as O), but feedback says N(-) meaning N is in word but not in 3rd. This is impossible because O is already in 3rd. This implies the word cannot have N in 3rd (which is already O), so N must be elsewhere. But the first N in donny is in 3rd, so feedback says N(-) meaning N is in word but not in 3rd. This is a contradiction unless the word has N in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position.

   - Second N in donny is in 4th position, and feedback says N(-) meaning N is in word but not in 4th. So N is in word but not in 4th or 3rd (from first N feedback). From first N feedback, N is in word but not in 3rd (which we already know is O), so N must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th.

   - Also, Y is not in word (Y(x)).

   - Letters known absent so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, T, D, Y.

   - Pattern: _ _ O _ _
   - N is in word but not in 3rd or 4th, so N must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th.
   - No other vowels except O in 3rd, so remaining vowels to consider: U (since A, E, I are out).
   - Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, Z, X, Q (avoiding P, R, S, T, D).

   Let's try to find a word with:
   - O in 3rd
   - N in 1st, 2nd, or 5th
   - Avoid all forbidden letters
   - Likely to use common letters.

From the feedback:
- O is locked in the 3rd position.
- N is in the word but not in 3rd or 4th positions (from donny feedback), so N must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, T, D, Y.
- Remaining vowels: U (only other vowel left).
- Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, Z, X, Q.

The word must be of the form:
- _ _ O _ _
- N must appear in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position.
- Use remaining allowed letters.

A valid candidate is ""KNOCK"":
- K (1st) – allowed

- O (3rd) – locked
