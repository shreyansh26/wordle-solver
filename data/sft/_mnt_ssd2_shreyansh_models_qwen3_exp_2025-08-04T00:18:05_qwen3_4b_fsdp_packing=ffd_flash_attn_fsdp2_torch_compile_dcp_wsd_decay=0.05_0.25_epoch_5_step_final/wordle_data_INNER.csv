### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Need two more letters not excluded (not A, O, S, D, C). Common unused: T, N, L, U, etc.
Possible endings: E I R T _ or E I R N _ etc.

""ELITE"" uses E twice – bad.
""EIRIK"" – not common.
""EIRAL"" – contains A – bad.

Let’s try R in position 4:
- _ _ _ R _
E cannot be 5, so E could be 1, 2, or 3
I cannot be 4, so I could be 1, 2, 3, or 5

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, D, C
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, I
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from arose and redic)
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and redic)
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from redic)

So the secret word contains the letters R, E, I exactly once each, and does not contain A, O, S, D, C.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Uses the letters R, E, I once each
- Places R somewhere other than positions 1 or 2
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5
- Places I somewhere other than position 4
- Uses only letters not excluded (no A, O, S, D, C)

Remaining common unused letters: T, N, L, U, G, B, M, P, Y, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s try to place R, E, I legally and add two new letters.

Possible positions:
R can be in 3, 4, or 5
E can be in 1, 3, or 4
I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s try R in position 3:
- Word pattern: _ _ R _ _
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5, so E could be 1 or 4
- I cannot be in position 4, so I could be 1, 2, or 5

Let’s try E in position 1 and I in position 2:
- E I R _ _
Need two more letters not excluded (not A, O, S, D, C). Common unused: T, N, L, U, etc.
Possible endings: E I R T _ or E I R N _ etc.

""ELITE"" uses E twice – bad.
""EIRIK"" – not common.
""EIRAL"" – contains A – bad.

Let’s try R in position 4:
- _ _ _ R _
E cannot be 5, so E could be 1, 2, or 3
I cannot be 4, so I could be 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s try E in position 3 and I in position 1:
- I _ E R _
Need one more letter. Common unused: T, N, L, U...
Possible: I N E R T, I N E R N, etc. ""INERT"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, E, R, T
- No A, O, S, D, C – good
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- I is in position 1 (allowed)
- All letters are unique – good

Thus, ""INERT"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R and E somewhere, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5
2. Does not contain A, O, or S
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y

I'll try a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters. ""TREND"" uses T, R, E, N, D - all common letters, and places R in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the feedback), so that's bad. Let me rethink.

Better to place R and E in different positions. Let's try ""CRUEL"":
- C is new
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2), so no good

Next, ""PERIL"":
- P, I, L are new
- E is in position 4 (good, not position 5)
- R is in position 2 (bad, not position 2)

""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 and 4 (good)
- R in position 2 and 5 (bad, R not in position 2)

""REDIC"":
- R in position 1 (good)
- E in position 2 (good)
- D, I, C are new

This seems good - R in position 1 (new), E in position 2 (new), and introduces D, I, C.

Let’s try R in position 3:

- I cannot be in position 4, so I could be 1, 2, or 5

- E I R _ _
Need two more letters not excluded (not A, O, S, D, C). Common unused: T, N, L, U, etc.
Possible endings: E I R T _ or E I R N _ etc.

""ELITE"" uses E twice – bad.
""EIRIK"" – not common.
""EIRAL"" – contains A – bad.

Let’s try R in position 4:
- _ _ _ R _
E cannot be 5, so E could be 1, 2, or 3
I cannot be 4, so I could be 1, 2, 3, or 5

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try placing E in position 4 instead:
Word pattern: I N _ E _
R must then go in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is allowed for R (since R is forbidden in 1,2,4).
So:
- I N R E _ – but R would be in position 3 (allowed)
- I N _ E R – R in position 5 (allowed)

First option: I N R E _
Need a letter for position 4 (must be allowed and form valid word)
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Need a valid word: I N R E _

Possible candidates:
- INRER – not valid
- INREF – not valid
- INRGE – not valid
- INRHU – not valid
- INRKI – not valid
- INRLI – not valid
- INRMU – not valid
- INRPY – not valid
- INRVY – not valid
- INRXI – not valid
- INRYL – not valid

Second option: I N _ E R
Need a letter for position 3 (must be allowed and form valid word)
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Need a valid word: I N _ E R

Possible candidates:
- INBER – not valid
- INFER – yes, ""infer"" is a valid word
- INGER – not valid
- INHER – not valid
- INKER – not valid
- INLER – not valid
- INMER – not valid
- INPER – not valid
- INVER – not valid
- INWER – not valid

The only valid word from these options is ""INFER"".

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, F, E, R
- No A, O, S, D, C, T – good
- I in position 1 (✓)
- N in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, not 1,2,4)
- All letters are unique – goodBased on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is:

From the latest feedback on INFER:

The only missing letter is the third position.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
All letters except A, O, S, D, C, T, F.

Common remaining consonants: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form “IN _ ER”.

The only valid English word that matches is **INFER**, but we already tried it and got feedback.

“INGER” is not a word; “INHER” is not a word; “INKER” is not a word; “INLER” is not a word; “INMER” is not a word; “INPER” is not a word; “INVER” is not a word; “INWER” is not a word.

But **INFER** was already tried.  
Is there any other valid word?  
Yes—**INFER** is already used.  
The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern is **INFER**, but it was already guessed.  
This suggests we must have missed something.

Wait—let’s re-examine the pattern: I N _ E R.

The missing letter must be a single consonant or vowel not yet ruled out.  
Looking at the pattern, the only valid English word is **INFER**, but F is already ruled out.  
Next possibility: **INGER** – invalid.  
**INHER** – invalid.  
**INKER** – invalid.

**INMER** – invalid.  
**INPER** – invalid.  
**INVER** – invalid.  
**INWER** – invalid.

But **INFER** was already tried.  
This implies the only possible word is **INFER**, yet it was already used.  
This contradiction suggests an error in our earlier steps.

Re-examining:  
From Guess 1: R is in word but not position 2.  
From Guess 2: R is in word but not position 1.  
From Guess 3: R is in word but not position 4.  
From Guess 4: R is correctly placed in position 5.  
Thus, R is fixed at position 5.

Similarly, I is fixed at position 1, N at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.  
Thus the word is I N _ E R.

The only missing letter is the third position.  
The only valid English word that fits is **INFER**, but F is ruled out.  
This implies the word must be **INFER**, yet F is invalid.  
This contradiction suggests we must have missed a valid word.

Wait—let’s check **INKER**:  
I N K E R – is **INKER** a valid word?  
Yes, “INKER” is a valid English word (the residue of ink on paper).

Let’s verify constraints:
- I N K E R  
- Contains I, N, K, E, R – all allowed (no A, O, S, D, C, T, F)  
- I in position 1 (✓)  
- N in position 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R and E somewhere, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5
2. Does not contain A, O, or S
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y

I'll try a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters. ""TREND"" uses T, R, E, N, D - all common letters, and places R in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the feedback), so that's bad. Let me rethink.

Better to place R and E in different positions. Let's try ""CRUEL"":
- C is new
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2), so no good

Next, ""PERIL"":
- P, I, L are new
- E is in position 4 (good, not position 5)
- R is in position 2 (bad, not position 2)

""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 and 4 (good)
- R in position 2 and 5 (bad, R not in position 2)

""REDIC"":
- R in position 1 (good)
- E in position 2 (good)
- D, I, C are new

This seems good - R in position 1 (new), E in position 2 (new), and introduces D, I, C.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, D, C
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, I
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from arose and redic)
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and redic)
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from redic)

So the secret word contains the letters R, E, I exactly once each, and does not contain A, O, S, D, C.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Uses the letters R, E, I once each
- Places R somewhere other than positions 1 or 2
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5
- Places I somewhere other than position 4
- Uses only letters not excluded (no A, O, S, D, C)

Remaining common unused letters: T, N, L, U, G, B, M, P, Y, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s try to place R, E, I legally and add two new letters.

Possible positions:
R can be in 3, 4, or 5
E can be in 1, 3, or 4
I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s try R in position 3:
- Word pattern: _ _ R _ _
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5, so E could be 1 or 4
- I cannot be in position 4, so I could be 1, 2, or 5

Let’s try E in position 1 and I in position 2:
- E I R _ _
Need two more letters not excluded (not A, O, S, D, C). Common unused: T, N, L, U, etc.
Possible endings: E I R T _ or E I R N _ etc.

""ELITE"" uses E twice – bad.
""EIRIK"" – not common.
""EIRAL"" – contains A – bad.

Let’s try R in position 4:
- _ _ _ R _
E cannot be 5, so E could be 1, 2, or 3
I cannot be 4, so I could be 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s try E in position 3 and I in position 1:
- I _ E R _
Need one more letter. Common unused: T, N, L, U...
Possible: I N E R T, I N E R N, etc. ""INERT"" is a valid word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: redic -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
Guess 3: inert -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Now we have three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. redic → R(-) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
3. inert → I(✓) N(✓) E(-) R(-) T(x)

What we know for sure:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, D, C, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: I, N, R, E
   – I is in position 1 (✓)
   – N is in position 2 (✓)
   – E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and redic)
   – R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (from arose, redic, inert)

So the word looks like: I N _ _ _

Letters still available (not excluded): B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Letters already confirmed present: E, R (but not in their forbidden positions).

E must go in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
R must go in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, 4).

Let’s try placing E in position 3:
Word pattern: I N E _ _
R must then go in position 5: I N E _ R
The missing letter (position 4) must be from the allowed set and must form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters for position 4: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
We need a valid word: I N E _ R

Possible candidates:
- INEER – not valid
- INEGR – not valid
- INEKR – not valid
- INELR – not valid
- INEMR – not valid
- INEPY – not valid
- INEVY – not valid
- INEXR – not valid (X not allowed)
- INEPR – not valid
- INEBR – ""inibr"" – not valid
- INEER – not valid
- INEKR – not valid
- INELR – not valid
- INEMR – not valid
- INEPY – not valid
- INEVY – not valid
- INEXR – not valid
- INEPR – not valid
- INEBR – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try placing E in position 4 instead:
Word pattern: I N _ E _
R must then go in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is allowed for R (since R is forbidden in 1,2,4).
So:
- I N R E _ – but R would be in position 3 (allowed)
- I N _ E R – R in position 5 (allowed)

First option: I N R E _
Need a letter for position 4 (must be allowed and form valid word)
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Need a valid word: I N R E _

Possible candidates:
- INRER – not valid
- INREF – not valid
- INRGE – not valid
- INRHU – not valid
- INRKI – not valid
- INRLI – not valid
- INRMU – not valid
- INRPY – not valid
- INRVY – not valid
- INRXI – not valid
- INRYL – not valid

Second option: I N _ E R
Need a letter for position 3 (must be allowed and form valid word)
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Need a valid word: I N _ E R

Possible candidates:
- INBER – not valid
- INFER – yes, ""infer"" is a valid word
- INGER – not valid
- INHER – not valid
- INKER – not valid
- INLER – not valid
- INMER – not valid
- INPER – not valid
- INVER – not valid
- INWER – not valid

The only valid word from these options is ""INFER"".

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, F, E, R
- No A, O, S, D, C, T – good
- I in position 1 (✓)
- N in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, not 1,2,4)
- All letters are unique – goodBased on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is:

From the latest feedback on INFER:
- I(✓) – correct in position 1  
- N(✓) – correct in position 2  
- F(x) – F is NOT in the word  
- E(✓) – correct in position 4  
- R(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the secret word now looks like: I N _ E R

The only missing letter is the third position.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
All letters except A, O, S, D, C, T, F.

Common remaining consonants: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form “IN _ ER”.  
Checking each possibility:

- INBER – invalid  
- INGER – invalid  
- INHER – invalid  
- INKER – invalid  
- INLER – invalid  
- INMER – invalid  
- INPER – invalid  
- INVER – invalid  
- INWER – invalid  

The only valid English word that matches is **INFER**, but we already tried it and got feedback.  
Wait—let’s double-check the dictionary:  
“INGER” is not a word; “INHER” is not a word; “INKER” is not a word; “INLER” is not a word; “INMER” is not a word; “INPER” is not a word; “INVER” is not a word; “INWER” is not a word.

But **INFER** was already tried.  
Is there any other valid word?  
Yes—**INFER** is already used.  
The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern is **INFER**, but it was already guessed.  
This suggests we must have missed something.

Wait—let’s re-examine the pattern: I N _ E R.

The missing letter must be a single consonant or vowel not yet ruled out.  
Looking at the pattern, the only valid English word is **INFER**, but F is already ruled out.  
Next possibility: **INGER** – invalid.  
**INHER** – invalid.  
**INKER** – invalid.  
**INLER** – invalid.  
**INMER** – invalid.  
**INPER** – invalid.  
**INVER** – invalid.  
**INWER** – invalid.

But **INFER** was already tried.  
This implies the only possible word is **INFER**, yet it was already used.  
This contradiction suggests an error in our earlier steps.

Re-examining:  
From Guess 1: R is in word but not position 2.  
From Guess 2: R is in word but not position 1.  
From Guess 3: R is in word but not position 4.  
From Guess 4: R is correctly placed in position 5.  
Thus, R is fixed at position 5.

Similarly, I is fixed at position 1, N at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.  
Thus the word is I N _ E R.

The only missing letter is the third position.  
The only valid English word that fits is **INFER**, but F is ruled out.  
This implies the word must be **INFER**, yet F is invalid.  
This contradiction suggests we must have missed a valid word.

Wait—let’s check **INKER**:  
I N K E R – is **INKER** a valid word?  
Yes, “INKER” is a valid English word (the residue of ink on paper).

Let’s verify constraints:
- I N K E R  
- Contains I, N, K, E, R – all allowed (no A, O, S, D, C, T, F)  
- I in position 1 (✓)  
- N in position 2 (✓)  
- K in position 3 – never tested, so allowed  
- E in position 4 (✓)  
- R in position 5 (✓)  

Thus, **INKER** is the correct next guess.
