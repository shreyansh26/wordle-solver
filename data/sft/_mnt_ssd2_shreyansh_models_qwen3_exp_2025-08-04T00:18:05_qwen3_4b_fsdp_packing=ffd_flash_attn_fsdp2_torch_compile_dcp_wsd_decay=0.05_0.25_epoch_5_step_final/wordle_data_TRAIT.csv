For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives me good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is confirmed at position 2.
   - A is confirmed in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it shows ✓ there, that contradicts the earlier “-” for A in position 1, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is absent.

So the pattern is now:
T R _ _ _
and we know:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- I must be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be in 4).
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, N.

Let’s assemble the remaining three letters (positions 3, 4, 5) using the constraints:
- Position 4: A or I (since A must be in 4 or 5, and I must be in 3 or 5)
- Position 3: If I is in 5, then position 3 can be any unused consonant; if I is in 3, then position 4 must be A, and position 5 must be I.

A good next word that satisfies all constraints is:
T R I A _

Because:
- T and R are already correct in positions 1 and 2.
- I in position 3 is allowed (feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4).
- A in position 4 satisfies the requirement that A is in the word but not in position 1 (and now it’s in 4).
- The final letter (position 5) is still open; we can test a common consonant not yet used, like D, L, M, etc.

A quick check of valid 5-letter words gives us “TRIA_” – the only common word that fits is TRIAD.

   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is confirmed at position 2.
   - A is confirmed in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it shows ✓ there, that contradicts the earlier “-” for A in position 1, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is absent.

3. TRIAD → T(✓) R(✓) I(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T and R are confirmed at positions 1 and 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D is absent.

So the pattern is:
T R _ _ _
and we know:
- A must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).
- I must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is now taken by A, so I must be in position 3.
- That leaves position 4 to be filled by any letter not yet ruled out (O, S, E, N, D are out).

Current word shape:
T R I _ A

We need a single consonant for position 4 that hasn’t been tested yet and doesn’t violate any rules. Common unused consonants include: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching T R I _ A:
- TRIGA – not a common word.
- TRIKA – not common.
- TRIQA – not valid.
- TRIPA – valid (though rare).
- TRIMA – not standard.
- TRIWA – not valid.
- TRIHA – not valid.
- TRIGA – already noted.
- TRIJA – not a word.

Actually, the most common valid word fitting T R I _ A is “TRIKA” (not very common) or “TRIGA” (not standard). Let me reconsider – the word “TRIKA” isn’t listed in standard dictionaries. The only standard word I can find is “TRIWA” which isn’t valid.

Wait, let me double-check standard dictionaries. The only standard 5-letter word matching T R I _ A is “TRIKA” (Scrabble word) but that’s obscure. Actually, “TRIWA” isn’t valid. The correct word is “TRIKA” but that’s rare.

However, there’s a more common word: “TRIKA” is actually valid in some word lists. But let me think of others. 

Another approach: position 4 can be any unused consonant. Let’s list possible consonants and check validity:

- T R I B A – “TRIBA” – valid (a surname)
- T R I C A – “TRICA” – valid (Scrabble)
- T R I F A – “TRIFA” – not valid
- T R I G A – “TRIGA” – not standard
- T R I K A – “TRIKA” – valid (Scrabble)
- T R I L A – “TRILA” – not valid
- T R I M A – “TRIMA” – not valid
- T R I P A – “TRIPA” – valid (Spanish loanword, accepted in Scrabble)

Among these, “TRIBA” and “TRIPA” are the most standard. I’ll choose “TRIBA” as it’s more widely recognized.

Therefore, the next guess is TRIBA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives me good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ _ _
- It contains A somewhere (but not in position 1).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Good letters to try next: A, I, U, T, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Includes A somewhere else (positions 3,4, or 5)
3. Avoids O, S, E
4. Uses other common consonants to test new letters

Possible candidates: TRAIN, CRANK, DRANK, BRAND, PRANK, TRAMP

""TRAIN"" seems good because:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (but not position 1, so fits A(-))
- Tests T, I, N which are common letters
- Avoids O, S, E

Let's go with TRAIN.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is confirmed at position 2.
   - A is confirmed in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it shows ✓ there, that contradicts the earlier “-” for A in position 1, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is absent.

So the pattern is now:
T R _ _ _
and we know:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- I must be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be in 4).
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, N.

Let’s assemble the remaining three letters (positions 3, 4, 5) using the constraints:
- Position 4: A or I (since A must be in 4 or 5, and I must be in 3 or 5)
- Position 3: If I is in 5, then position 3 can be any unused consonant; if I is in 3, then position 4 must be A, and position 5 must be I.

A good next word that satisfies all constraints is:
T R I A _

Because:
- T and R are already correct in positions 1 and 2.
- I in position 3 is allowed (feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4).
- A in position 4 satisfies the requirement that A is in the word but not in position 1 (and now it’s in 4).
- The final letter (position 5) is still open; we can test a common consonant not yet used, like D, L, M, etc.

A quick check of valid 5-letter words gives us “TRIA_” – the only common word that fits is TRIAD.

Let’s summarize what we now know after four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is confirmed at position 2.
   - A is confirmed in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it shows ✓ there, that contradicts the earlier “-” for A in position 1, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is absent.

3. TRIAD → T(✓) R(✓) I(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T and R are confirmed at positions 1 and 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D is absent.

4. TRIBA → T(✓) R(✓) I(-) B(x) A(-)
   - T and R are confirmed at positions 1 and 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - B is absent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4 (confirms earlier feedback).

From all feedback:
- Pattern: T R _ _ _
- Position 5 must be A (since A can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).
- I must be in position 3 or 5, but 5 is A, so I is in position 3.
- That leaves position 4 to be any letter not yet ruled out (O, S, E, D, B are out, and we’ve used T, R, I, A).

So the word must be: T R I _ A
We need a single consonant for position 4 that hasn’t been tested yet and doesn’t violate any rules. Unused common consonants include: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching T R I _ A:
- TRIGA – not standard
- TRIKA – Scrabble only
- TRIQA – invalid
- TRIPA – valid (though rare)
- TRIMA – invalid
- TRIWA – invalid
- TRICA – Scrabble
- TRIFL – invalid
- TRIGS – invalid

The most standard word I can find is “TRIPA” (a Spanish loanword accepted in Scrabble). Another possible is “TRIKA” but it’s less common. 

However, “TRIGA” isn’t valid. The only valid word seems to be “TRIPA”. 

Therefore, the next guess is TRIKA or TRIPA. Between them, TRIKA is slightly more common in Scrabble lists. I’ll go with TRIKA.

But wait – let me double-check standard dictionaries. The only standard word matching T R I _ A is “TRIKA” (Scrabble) and “TRIPA” (also Scrabble). There’s no common English word. 

Realizing this, I need to reconsider – perhaps I missed another possibility. Actually, the word “TRIKA” isn’t in most dictionaries. The correct word is “TRIPA” which is accepted in Scrabble. 

Given this, the next guess is TRIPA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives me good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ _ _
- It contains A somewhere (but not in position 1).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Good letters to try next: A, I, U, T, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Includes A somewhere else (positions 3,4, or 5)
3. Avoids O, S, E
4. Uses other common consonants to test new letters

Possible candidates: TRAIN, CRANK, DRANK, BRAND, PRANK, TRAMP

""TRAIN"" seems good because:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (but not position 1, so fits A(-))
- Tests T, I, N which are common letters
- Avoids O, S, E

Let's go with TRAIN.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is confirmed at position 2.
   - A is confirmed in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it shows ✓ there, that contradicts the earlier “-” for A in position 1, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is absent.

So the pattern is now:
T R _ _ _
and we know:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- I must be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be in 4).
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, N.

Let’s assemble the remaining three letters (positions 3, 4, 5) using the constraints:
- Position 4: A or I (since A must be in 4 or 5, and I must be in 3 or 5)
- Position 3: If I is in 5, then position 3 can be any unused consonant; if I is in 3, then position 4 must be A, and position 5 must be I.

A good next word that satisfies all constraints is:
T R I A _

Because:
- T and R are already correct in positions 1 and 2.
- I in position 3 is allowed (feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4).
- A in position 4 satisfies the requirement that A is in the word but not in position 1 (and now it’s in 4).
- The final letter (position 5) is still open; we can test a common consonant not yet used, like D, L, M, etc.

A quick check of valid 5-letter words gives us “TRIA_” – the only common word that fits is TRIAD.

So:

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is confirmed at position 2.
   - A is confirmed in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it shows ✓ there, that contradicts the earlier “-” for A in position 1, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is absent.

3. TRIAD → T(✓) R(✓) I(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T and R are confirmed at positions 1 and 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D is absent.

So the pattern is:
T R _ _ _
and we know:
- A must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).
- I must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is now taken by A, so I must be in position 3.
- That leaves position 4 to be filled by any letter not yet ruled out (O, S, E, N, D are out).

Current word shape:
T R I _ A

We need a single consonant for position 4 that hasn’t been tested yet and doesn’t violate any rules. Common unused consonants include: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching T R I _ A:
- TRIGA – not a common word.
- TRIKA – not common.
- TRIQA – not valid.
- TRIPA – valid (though rare).
- TRIMA – not standard.
- TRIWA – not valid.
- TRIHA – not valid.
- TRIGA – already noted.
- TRIJA – not a word.

Actually, the most common valid word fitting T R I _ A is “TRIKA” (not very common) or “TRIGA” (not standard). Let me reconsider – the word “TRIKA” isn’t listed in standard dictionaries. The only standard word I can find is “TRIWA” which isn’t valid.

Wait, let me double-check standard dictionaries. The only standard 5-letter word matching T R I _ A is “TRIKA” (Scrabble word) but that’s obscure. Actually, “TRIWA” isn’t valid. The correct word is “TRIKA” but that’s rare.

However, there’s a more common word: “TRIKA” is actually valid in some word lists. But let me think of others. 

Another approach: position 4 can be any unused consonant. Let’s list possible consonants and check validity:

- T R I B A – “TRIBA” – valid (a surname)
- T R I C A – “TRICA” – valid (Scrabble)
- T R I F A – “TRIFA” – not valid
- T R I G A – “TRIGA” – not standard
- T R I K A – “TRIKA” – valid (Scrabble)
- T R I L A – “TRILA” – not valid
- T R I M A – “TRIMA” – not valid
- T R I P A – “TRIPA” – valid (Spanish loanword, accepted in Scrabble)

Among these, “TRIBA” and “TRIPA” are the most standard. I’ll choose “TRIBA” as it’s more widely recognized.

Therefore, the next guess is TRIBA.

   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D is absent.

4. TRIBA → T(✓) R(✓) I(-) B(x) A(-)
   - T and R are confirmed at positions 1 and 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - B is absent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4 (confirms earlier feedback).

From all feedback:
- Pattern: T R _ _ _
- Position 5 must be A (since A can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).
- I must be in position 3 or 5, but 5 is A, so I is in position 3.
- That leaves position 4 to be any letter not yet ruled out (O, S, E, D, B are out, and we’ve used T, R, I, A).

So the word must be: T R I _ A
We need a single consonant for position 4 that hasn’t been tested yet and doesn’t violate any rules. Unused common consonants include: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching T R I _ A:
- TRIGA – not standard
- TRIKA – Scrabble only
- TRIQA – invalid
- TRIPA – valid (though rare)
- TRIMA – invalid
- TRIWA – invalid
- TRICA – Scrabble
- TRIFL – invalid
- TRIGS – invalid

The most standard word I can find is “TRIPA” (a Spanish loanword accepted in Scrabble). Another possible is “TRIKA” but it’s less common. 

However, “TRIGA” isn’t valid. The only valid word seems to be “TRIPA”. 

Therefore, the next guess is TRIKA or TRIPA. Between them, TRIKA is slightly more common in Scrabble lists. I’ll go with TRIKA.

But wait – let me double-check standard dictionaries. The only standard word matching T R I _ A is “TRIKA” (Scrabble) and “TRIPA” (also Scrabble). There’s no common English word. 

Realizing this, I need to reconsider – perhaps I missed another possibility. Actually, the word “TRIKA” isn’t in most dictionaries. The correct word is “TRIPA” which is accepted in Scrabble.

We now know:
- T R _ _ _ is locked in positions 1 and 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
  (It can’t be in 1 because A(-) in AROSE; can’t be in 3 because A(✓) in TRAIN; can’t be in 4 or 5 because A(-) in TRIAD and TRIPA.)
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from TRIAD and TRIBA).
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, D, B, P.

So:
- Position 3 cannot be I, A, O, S, E, D, B, P.
- Position 4 cannot be A, I, O, S, E, D, B, P.
- Position 5 cannot be A, I, O, S, E, D, B, P.

The only remaining consonants for positions 3, 4, 5 are: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form T R _ _ _ that contains both A and I exactly once each, with A somewhere in positions 2-5 (but position 2 is R), and I somewhere in positions 1-3 (but positions 1-2 are T R), so I must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be T R I _ _, and A must appear in position 4 or 5, but we know A cannot be in 4 or 5 (from TRIAD and TRIPA). This is impossible unless we made an error.

Rechecking constraints:
- AROSE: A(-) – A exists but not in 1.
- TRAIN: A(✓) – A exists and is in 3.
- TRIAD: A(-) – A exists but not in 4.
- TRIPA: A(-) – A exists but not in 5.

So A must be in position 3, but TRAIN already showed A(✓) in position 3, which contradicts A(-) in TRIAD for position 4 and TRIPA for position 5. This implies A must be in position 3, but cannot be in 4 or 5, which is fine – it’s confirmed in 3.

Wait, the contradiction is resolved: A is in position 3 (from TRAIN), and we have:
- TRIAD: A(-) means A is not in 4 (consistent).
- TRIPA: A(-) means A is not in 5 (consistent).

Thus the word is T R I A _, and we need a single consonant for position 5 not in {O, S, E, D, B, P}.

Possible consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words T R I A _:
- TRIAC – valid (a type of thyristor)
- TRIAL – valid (common word)
- TRIKA – invalid
- TRIAL is the most common.

So the next guess is TRIAL.
