### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and will help me narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the placement of vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is correct and in the right place (last letter).
- A, R, O are in the word but in wrong positions.

So the secret word ends with S and contains A, R, O somewhere in the first four positions.  
I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S
2. Contains A, R, O (but not in their original positions: A-1, R-2, O-3)
3. Uses only valid English letters and is a real word.

Possible placements for A, R, O:
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3

A good candidate is ""ROAST"":
- Ends with S
- Contains R, O, A (R in position 1, O in position 2, A in position 3 – none of these violate the positional constraints)
- All letters are valid and it’s a real word.

Let’s try ROAST.
