For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This combination can help me quickly identify which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better balanced. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E
2. Avoids A, R, O
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5

Good next guesses should test other common consonants and vowels. Since we know O is out, let's try a word with I or U. A strong candidate is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E
- Doesn't have A, R, O
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5)
- Uses common letters T and I

This seems like a solid next guess to gather more information.

From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 1.
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in position 2.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 3.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S T E _ _
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, I, N
- We still need to determine positions 4 and 5.

Good remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I are out)
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that start with STE and use remaining letters. Possible endings:
- STE_U
- STE_

Common words: STEEL, STEMS, STEP, STEPS, STENO (but N is out), STEAK, STEAM, STONE (O is out), STOLE, STOLE, STOLE, etc.

The most promising candidates are:
- STEEL (but L hasn’t been tested)
- STEPS (but P hasn’t been tested)
- STEAK (K hasn’t been tested)
- STOLE (O is out, so no)

Among these, ""STEPS"" uses two new letters (P and S again, but S is already confirmed in position 1). However, since S is already fixed in position 1, the ending would need to be PS. But ""STEPS"" is S T E P S, which would have S in position 5, but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if S appears twice. This might not be the best.

Another good candidate is ""STEAM"" (A is out), so no. ""STEEL"" is possible, but L hasn’t been tested.

Looking at remaining letters, ""STEPS"" seems the most plausible common word, but let me reconsider. The word must be S T E _ _. The only common words I can think of are:
- STEEL
- STEPS
- STEAK
- STEMS

""STEEL"" uses L, which hasn’t been eliminated. ""STEPS"" uses P. ""STEAK"" uses K. ""STEMS"" uses M.

Among these, ""STEEL"" seems most likely because L is a common letter and forms a valid word. Let me check: STEEL is S T E E L. This uses E twice, which is possible since E is already confirmed in position 3. The second E would be in position 4, and L in position 5. This seems like a reasonable guess.

Alternatively, ""STEMS"" is S T E M S, but M and S again. Since S is already in position 1, we don’t know if it appears again, but this is still possible.

Between STEEL and STEMS, I’ll go with STEEL as it’s more common and tests L, which hasn’t been used yet.

But wait, in STEEL, the letters would be S T E E L. We know:
- S is in position 1
- T is in position 2
- E is in position 3
- The fourth letter is E (but we already know E is in position 3, so this would imply E is in position 4, which is possible if the word has double E)
- L is new

This seems valid. However, I should also consider that the word might be STEPS or STEMS. 

Another thought: the word could be ""STEPS"" (S T E P S), but this would have S in both positions 1 and 5, which might be possible but less common.

After reconsidering, ""STEEL"" seems the most straightforward common word that fits all constraints.

Final choice: STEEL
