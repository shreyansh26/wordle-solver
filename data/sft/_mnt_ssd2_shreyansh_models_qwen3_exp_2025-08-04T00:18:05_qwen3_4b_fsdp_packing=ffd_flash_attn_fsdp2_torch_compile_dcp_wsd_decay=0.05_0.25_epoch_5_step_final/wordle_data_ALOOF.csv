### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 unique, high-frequency letters that should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- A is in the word and in the first position.
- O is in the word and in the third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the third position
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E anywhere else
4. Uses only valid English words

Some candidate letters for the 2nd and 4th positions (and 5th) that are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. “ABOIL” is invalid because it contains an I in position 4 and L in 5, but let’s check: A(✓) B(?) O(✓) I(?) L(?). However, we don’t know about B, I, or L yet. A better choice might be “ACORN” but R is forbidden. “ACOUSTIC” is too long. “APOCALYPSE” is too long. “AMONG” fits: A(✓) M(?) O(✓) N(?) G(?).

But “AMONG” is a good candidate because:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (M, N, G are new)
- Common word

Let’s go with “AMONG”.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. \n\nLooking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis gives us 5 unique, high-frequency letters that should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “arose” we know:\n\n- A is in the word and in the first position.\n- O is in the word and in the third position.\n- R, S, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the pattern so far is:\nA _ O _ _\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

O(✓) I(?) L(?). However, we don’t know about B, I, or L yet. A better choice might be “ACORN” but R is forbidden. “ACOUSTIC” is too long. “APOCALYPSE” is too long. “AMONG” fits: A(✓) M(?) O(✓) N(?) G(?).\n\nBut “AMONG” is a good candidate because:\n- Starts with A\n- Has O in position 3\n- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (M, N, G are new)\n- Common word\n\nLet’s go with “AMONG”.\n\n<guess>among</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: among -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two previous guesses we know:\n\n1.

We now know:

- Fixed letters: A _ O _ _
- Eliminated letters: R, S, E, M, N, G, D, P, T

Available letters (still untested): B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form A _ O _ _ using only these remaining letters.

Let’s list possible combinations:

- A B O _ _ → ABOCK, ABOIL (but L is allowed), ABOYS (but Y is allowed)
- A C O _ _ → ACORN (R is out), ACOUST (too long), ACOYA (not common)
- A F O _ _ → AFOUL (U, L are allowed)
- A H O _ _ → AHOY (Y is allowed)
- A I O _ _ → AIORY (not a word)
- A K O _ _ → AKOON (not common)
- A L O _ _ → ALOOF (F is allowed), ALOMA (not common)
- A V O _ _ → AVOID (D is out), AVONN (not common)
- A W O _ _ → AWOKEN (K, E is out), AWOOL (L is allowed)
- A Y O _ _ → AYONS (not common)

Among these, “AFOUL”, “AHOY”, “ALOOF”, and “AWOOL” are all valid English words.  
“ALOOF” is the most common and uses three new letters (L, O, F), so let’s try it.

(If ALOOF were invalid for any reason, we’d have other options like AFOUL or AHOY.)
