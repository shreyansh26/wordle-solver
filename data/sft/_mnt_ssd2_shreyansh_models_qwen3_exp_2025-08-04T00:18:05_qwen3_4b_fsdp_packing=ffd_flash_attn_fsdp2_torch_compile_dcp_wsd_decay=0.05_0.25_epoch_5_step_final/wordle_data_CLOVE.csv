1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word often includes:

- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, T, N, S, L, etc.

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)

   - The feedback “O(-)” here is therefore **irrelevant** to the 3rd position because the first guess already confirmed O is correct there.  
   - Eliminated letters from POINT: P, I, N, T (in addition to A, R, S).

This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word often includes:\n\n- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U\n- Common consonants like R, T, N, S, L, etc.\n\nSome popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common\n- 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- All letters are among the most frequent in English\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n- A, R, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the pattern is: _ _ O _ E, and the letters A, R, S are eliminated.\n\nNext, I want to test new common consonants and vowels. Remaining common consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, etc. Common vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already partially used, and E is locked in).\n\nI’ll look for a word that:\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern: _ _ O _ E
   - Eliminated letters: A, R, S

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is in the word but **not** in position 3 (because the first feedback already said it is in position 3).  
   - Eliminated letters added: P, I, N, T

3. FOGUE → F(x) O(-) G(x) U(x) E(✓)
   - O is again marked “-”, but since position 3 is already locked, this simply confirms O is in the word and not elsewhere (so it **must** be in position 3).  
   - Eliminated letters added: F, G, U

So far eliminated letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, F, G, U.

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: O, E (O is fixed at 3, E at 5)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ O _ E using only the remaining letters.

Possible combinations:
- C, L, D, H, M, V, W, Y

Good candidates:
- ""COVVE"" – invalid (double V, not common).  
- ""COMET"" – T eliminated.  
- ""COBWE"" – not a word.  
- ""CLOVE"" – C, L, V; all allowed.  
- ""CLOVE"" is a valid word meaning a small piece of wood or a clove of garlic.

""CLOVE"" tests C, L, V in positions 1, 2, 4, while keeping O and E fixed.
