For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Looking at common letters not yet used: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""TULIP"":
- Contains A? No, but we know A is in the word, so this might not be ideal.
Wait, we need to include A somewhere else.

Let me think of words with A in positions 2-5 and avoiding R,O,S,E.

""PAINT"" - but E is in arose feedback as absent, so T is okay.
- P, A, I, N, T.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1, so possible).

But let's check if this is optimal. Another option is ""PLANT"":
- P, L, A, N, T.
- A in position 3.

Alternatively, ""CANTO"" - but O is out.

""FLANK"":
- F, L, A, N, K.
- A in position 3.

""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K.
- A in position 3.

""PLANT"" seems good - uses P, L, A, N, T (none of R,O,S,E) and positions A in 3rd spot.

But let's see if we can use more common letters. ""PAINT"" is similar.

Another option: ""MADAM"" - but has double A and M, and D is okay.

Actually, ""MADAM"" has two A's and M, D. But positions are 1:M, 2:A, 3:D, 4:A, 5:M. A is in positions 2 and 4 - but we know A is in the word, but this might not help much.

Better: ""CAMPS"" - but S is out.

""CAMPS"" - S is out.

""CAMPA"" - but not a valid word.

""ALARM"" - has R (out), so no.

""ADMIT"" - has M, I, T. A in position 1 - but feedback says A is in word but not position 1, so position 1 is invalid.

""ADMIT"" - A is first letter, which is invalid (from arose feedback: A is not in position 1).

So avoid words with A in position 1.

Best so far: ""PLANT"" - A in position 3, uses P, L, N, T.

But let's see if we can include more common letters. ""PAINT"" is similar.

Alternatively, ""CANTO"" - O is out.

""BLANK"" - A in position 3, uses B, L, N, K.

""BULGY"" - Y is less common.

""PLANK"" - same as BLANK but P instead of B.

""GLAND"" - A in position 3, G, L, N, D.

""PLANT"" seems best among these.

But let's think of words with A in positions 2-5 and avoiding R,O,S,E.

""PAINT"" - P, A, I, N, T - valid word, A in 2, uses I and T which are common.

This seems like a strong second guess to gather more information.

Based on the feedback from ""arose"", I now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but A is not in position 1.
- The letters R, O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

To maximize information gain, I'm choosing a word that:
1. Includes the letter A (but not in position 1)
2. Avoids R, O, S, E
3. Uses other common letters (P, I, N, T) to test new possibilities

- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): A, I, T.

We also know:
- A is not in position 1 (from arose) and not in position 2 (from paint) → A can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- I is not in position 3 (from paint) → I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- T is not in position 5 (from paint) → T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Contains A, I, T exactly once each.  
- Places A only in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
- Places I anywhere except 3.  
- Places T anywhere except 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, O, S, E, P, N).

Candidate letters left: A, I, T, plus common unused ones like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next word should test new positions for A, I, T and introduce a few fresh letters to narrow things down.  
Let’s try “TIGAR” – but R is ruled out.  
“TIALK” – not a word.  
“CITAD” – not a word.  
“MIAOU” – uses U and O, but O is out.  
“TACIT” – uses C, T, I, A, but T appears twice (invalid).  
“VITAL” – uses L, V, I, T, A.  
Check positions:  
- V (new) – pos 1  
- I – pos 2 (allowed)  
- T – pos 3 (allowed)  
- A – pos 4 (allowed)  
- L (new) – pos 5  

No ruled-out letters, and it satisfies all constraints.

So, “VITAL” is a strong third guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Looking at common letters not yet used: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""TULIP"":
- Contains A? No, but we know A is in the word, so this might not be ideal.
Wait, we need to include A somewhere else.

Let me think of words with A in positions 2-5 and avoiding R,O,S,E.

""PAINT"" - but E is in arose feedback as absent, so T is okay.
- P, A, I, N, T.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1, so possible).

But let's check if this is optimal. Another option is ""PLANT"":
- P, L, A, N, T.
- A in position 3.

Alternatively, ""CANTO"" - but O is out.

""FLANK"":
- F, L, A, N, K.
- A in position 3.

""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K.
- A in position 3.

""PLANT"" seems good - uses P, L, A, N, T (none of R,O,S,E) and positions A in 3rd spot.

But let's see if we can use more common letters. ""PAINT"" is similar.

Another option: ""MADAM"" - but has double A and M, and D is okay.

Actually, ""MADAM"" has two A's and M, D. But positions are 1:M, 2:A, 3:D, 4:A, 5:M. A is in positions 2 and 4 - but we know A is in the word, but this might not help much.

Better: ""CAMPS"" - but S is out.

""CAMPS"" - S is out.

""CAMPA"" - but not a valid word.

""ALARM"" - has R (out), so no.

""ADMIT"" - has M, I, T. A in position 1 - but feedback says A is in word but not position 1, so position 1 is invalid.

""ADMIT"" - A is first letter, which is invalid (from arose feedback: A is not in position 1).

So avoid words with A in position 1.

Best so far: ""PLANT"" - A in position 3, uses P, L, N, T.

But let's see if we can include more common letters. ""PAINT"" is similar.

Alternatively, ""CANTO"" - O is out.

""BLANK"" - A in position 3, uses B, L, N, K.

""BULGY"" - Y is less common.

""PLANK"" - same as BLANK but P instead of B.

""GLAND"" - A in position 3, G, L, N, D.

""PLANT"" seems best among these.

But let's think of words with A in positions 2-5 and avoiding R,O,S,E.

""PAINT"" - P, A, I, N, T - valid word, A in 2, uses I and T which are common.

This seems like a strong second guess to gather more information.Based on the feedback from ""arose"", I now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but A is not in position 1.
- The letters R, O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

To maximize information gain, I'm choosing a word that:
1. Includes the letter A (but not in position 1)
2. Avoids R, O, S, E
3. Uses other common letters (P, I, N, T) to test new possibilities

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
A, R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L

Letters we have confirmed ARE in the word:
- I (position 2 is correct)  
- T (somewhere, but not position 5)  
- A (somewhere, but not positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 — wait, that can’t be right)

Hold on — let’s re-express the constraints carefully.

From the feedback:
- arose: A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 1.  
- paint: A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- vital: A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 4.  

So A is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  Therefore A must be in position 3 or 5.

From vital:
- I(✓) → I is in the word and is in position 2.  (Fixed.)  
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3.  (So T must be in 1, 4, or 5.)  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 4.  (So A must be in 3 or 5.)

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Contains A in position 3 or 5.  
- Contains T in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible letter sets:

Case 1: A in position 3  
Then positions are: _ I A _ _  
We still need T somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).  
Possible patterns:  
- T I A _ _ → T in 1  
- _ I A T _ → T in 4  
- _ I A _ T → T in 5  

Case 2: A in position 5  
Then positions are: _ I _ _ A  
We still need T somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).  
But position 5 is already A, so T must be in 1 or 4.  
Patterns:  
- T I _ _ A → T in 1  
- _ I _ T A → T in 4  

Letters we can still use: A, I, T, plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones).

Let’s look for real words that fit these patterns.

Pattern T I A _ _  
Need a valid 5-letter word starting TI A.  
- TIARA – uses R (ruled out).  
- TIKAL – uses L (ruled out).  
- TIBIA – uses B (allowed), but is TIBIA a word? Yes, it’s the bone.  
But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Pattern _ I A T _  
Need a word with I A T in positions 2,3,4.  
- C I A T _ – no.  
- B I A T _ – no.  
- F I A T _ – FIAT is a word, but it’s 4 letters.  
- H I A T _ – no.  

Pattern _ I A _ T  
Need I A _ T.  
- B I A _ T – no.  
- C I A _ T – no.  
- D I A _ T – no.  
- M I A _ T – no.  

Pattern T I _ _ A  
Need T I _ _ A.  
- T I M A A – no.  
- T I G A A – no.  
- T I C A A – no.  
- T I D A A – no.  
- T I B A A – no.  
- T I K A A – no.  
- T I H A A – no.  

Pattern _ I _ T A  
Need _ I _ T A.  
- B I G T A – no.  
- C I D T A – no.  
- F I G T A – no.  
- H I D T A – no.  
- M I D T A – no.  
- D I G T A – no.  
- G I V T A – no.  

Wait, let’s think of actual words that fit these constraints.

Looking at _ I A _ T:  
- B I A L T – no.  
- C I A R T – no.  
- D I A M T – no.  
- F I A R T – no.  
- H I A R T – no.  
- K I A R T – no.  
- M I A R T – no.  

Actually, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words that:
- Have I in position 2.  
- Have A in position 3 or 5.  
- Have T somewhere (positions 1,4,5).  
- No R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L.

Let’s scan mentally:
- B I A _ T – BIAT_ – no common word.  
- C I A _ T – CIAT_ – no.  
- D I A _ T – DIAT_ – no.  
- F I A _ T – FIAT_ – FIAT is 4 letters.  
- G I A _ T – GIATS – no.  
- H I A _ T – no.  
- K I A _ T – no.  
- M I A _ T – no.  
- W I A _ T – no.  

Going back to T I A _ _  
- T I A M A – no.  
- T I A K A – no.  
- T I A B A – no.  
- T I A D A – no.  
- T I A F A – no.  
- T I A H A – no.  

Actually, TIBIA (the bone) is valid, but it’s obscure.

Let’s try _ I _ T A  
- B I G T A – no.  
- C I D T A – no.  
- D I G T A – no.  
- F I G T A – no.  
- H I D T A – no.  
- M I D T A – no.  

Wait, let me think of “ditia” – no, that’s not a word.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with I in position 2, and see which fit the constraints.

Common 5-letter words with I in position 2:
- ABIDE – no.  
- ACIDY – no.  
- ADMIT – A is 1, so no.  
- AGING – A is 1, no.  
- ALIBI – A is 1, no.  
- AMBIT – A is 1, no.  
- ANKLE – no.  
- ANTIC – A is 1, no.  
- AORTA – A is 1, no.  
- ARGON – no.  
- ARSON – no.  
- ASIDE – A is 1, no.  
- ASWIR – no.  
- AXIOM – A is 1, no.  
- AHEAD – A is 1, no.  
- AFOOT – A is 1, no.  
- AGING – A is 1, no.  
- ADORE – A is 1, no.  
- AFRAI – A is 1, no.  
- AFIRE – A is 1, no.  
- AGING – A is 1, no.  

Wait, let me systematically list all 5-letter words with I in position 2:

- B I _ _ _  
- C I _ _ _  
- D I _ _ _  
- F I _ _ _  
- G I _ _ _  
- H I _ _ _  
- J I _ _ _  
- K I _ _ _

- Q I _ _ _  
- S I _ _ _  
- T I _ _ _  
- W I _ _ _  
- X I _ _ _  
- Y I _ _ _  
- Z I _ _ _  

From these, the valid English words are:

- BITES  
- BITUM – no.  
- BIVOU – no.  
- BISON – no.  
- BLOAT – no.  
- BLOAT – no.  
- BLOKE – no.  
- BOINK – no.  
- BOAST – no.  
- BOGUS – no.  
- BOLTS – no.  
- BONED – no.  
- BOOGE – no.  
- BOOGE – no.  
- BOOGE – no.  
- BOOGE – no.  
- BOOGE – no.  

Actually, common ones are:
- BITES  
- BLOAT  
- BOAST  
- BOINK  
- BISON  
- BOLTS  
- BONED  
- BOOGE – no.  

But we need A in the word as well (since A is confirmed). So filter these to include A:

- BITES – no A.  
- BLOAT – no A.  
- BOAST – no A.  
- BOINK – no A.  
- BISON – no A.  
- BOLTS – no A.  
- BONED – no A.  

None of these have A.  

Let’s try T I _ _ _  
- TIGER – no.  
- TIGHT – no.  
- TIKAL – no.  
- TIMID – no.  
- TIMOR – no.  
- TITAN – no.  
- TITHE – no.  
- TITIO – no.  
- TITLY – no.  
- TITRA – no.  
- TITUB – no.  
- TITZY – no.  

None have A.  

Let’s try _ I A _ _  
- B I A _ _ – no common word.  
- C I A _ _ – no.  
- D I A _ _ – no.  
- F I A _ _ – no.  
- G I A _ _ – no.  
- H I A _ _ – no.  
- M I A _ _ – no.  
- W I A _ _ – no.  

Actually, let me think of “MIAOU” – no, O is ruled out.  

Let’s try _ I _ A _  
- B I _ A _ – no.  
- C I _ A _ – no.  
- D I _ A _ – no.  
- F I _ A _ – no.  
- G I _ A _ – no.  
- H I _ A _ – no.  
- M I _ A _ – no.  
- W I _ A _ – no.  

Let me think of “DITTO” – no, O is ruled out.  

Let me think of “FIBIA” – no, not a word.  

Let me think of “GIMIA” – no.  

Let me think of “HIBAS” – no.  

Let me think of “KIBAS” – no.  

Let me think of “MIBAS” – no.  

Let me think of “WIBAS” – no.  

Let me think of “CIGAR” – no, R is ruled out.  

Let me think of “CITIZ” – no.  

Let me think of “DITZY” – no, Y is allowed, but no A.  

Let me think of “GIGAS” – no.  

Let me think of “HIBIT” – no.  

Let me think of “MIBIT” – no.  

Let me think of “WIBIT” – no.  

Let me think of “DITZY” – no A.  

Let me think of “FITCH” – no A.  

Let me think of “HITCH” – no A.  

Let me think of “MITCH” – no A.  

Let me think of “WITCH” – no A.  

Let me think of “FIBIA” – no.  

Let me think of “TIBIA” – this is a valid word (the bone), and it has:
- T I B I A  
But it has I in position 4 as well, and we already have I in position 2.  That’s allowed, but let’s check constraints:
- I is confirmed in position 2.  
- A must be in position 3 or 5.  In TIBIA, A is in 5.  
- T must be in 1, 4, or 5.  In TIBIA, T is in 1.  
- Letters used: T, I, B, I, A.  Only B is new.  
- No ruled-out letters.  

So TIBIA fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is TIBIA.
</think>

<guess>tibia</guess>",tibia,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
A, R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L

Letters we have confirmed ARE in the word:
- I (position 2 is correct)  
- T (somewhere, but not position 5)  
- A (somewhere, but not positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 — wait, that can’t be right)

Hold on — let’s re-express the constraints carefully.

From the feedback:
- arose: A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 1.  
- paint: A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- vital: A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 4.  

So A is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  Therefore A must be in position 3 or 5.

From vital:
- I(✓) → I is in the word and is in position 2.  (Fixed.)  
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3.  (So T must be in 1, 4, or 5.)  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 4.  (So A must be in 3 or 5.)

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Contains A in position 3 or 5.  
- Contains T in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible letter sets:

Case 1: A in position 3  
Then positions are: _ I A _ _  
We still need T somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).  
Possible patterns:  
- T I A _ _ → T in 1  
- _ I A T _ → T in 4  
- _ I A _ T → T in 5  

Case 2: A in position 5  
Then positions are: _ I _ _ A  
We still need T somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).  
But position 5 is already A, so T must be in 1 or 4.  
Patterns:  
- T I _ _ A → T in 1  
- _ I _ T A → T in 4  

Letters we can still use: A, I, T, plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones).

Let’s look for real words that fit these patterns.

Pattern T I A _ _  
Need a valid 5-letter word starting TI A.  
- TIARA – uses R (ruled out).  
- TIKAL – uses L (ruled out).  
- TIBIA – uses B (allowed), but is TIBIA a word? Yes, it’s the bone.  
But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Pattern _ I A T _  
Need a word with I A T in positions 2,3,4.  
- C I A T _ – no.  
- B I A T _ – no.  
- F I A T _ – FIAT is a word, but it’s 4 letters.  
- H I A T _ – no.  

Pattern _ I A _ T  
Need I A _ T.  
- B I A _ T – no.  
- C I A _ T – no.  
- D I A _ T – no.  
- M I A _ T – no.  

Pattern T I _ _ A  
Need T I _ _ A.  
- T I M A A – no.  
- T I G A A – no.  
- T I C A A – no.  
- T I D A A – no.  
- T I B A A – no.  
- T I K A A – no.  
- T I H A A – no.  

Pattern _ I _ T A  
Need _ I _ T A.  
- B I G T A – no.  
- C I D T A – no.  
- F I G T A – no.  
- H I D T A – no.  
- M I D T A – no.  
- D I G T A – no.  
- G I V T A – no.  

Wait, let’s think of actual words that fit these constraints.

Looking at _ I A _ T:  
- B I A L T – no.  
- C I A R T – no.  
- D I A M T – no.  
- F I A R T – no.  
- H I A R T – no.  
- K I A R T – no.  
- M I A R T – no.  

Actually, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words that:
- Have I in position 2.  
- Have A in position 3 or 5.  
- Have T somewhere (positions 1,4,5).  
- No R, O, S, E, P, N, V, L.

Let’s scan mentally:
- B I A _ T – BIAT_ – no common word.  
- C I A _ T – CIAT_ – no.  
- D I A _ T – DIAT_ – no.  
- F I A _ T – FIAT_ – FIAT is 4 letters.  
- G I A _ T – GIATS – no.  
- H I A _ T – no.  
- K I A _ T – no.  
- M I A _ T – no.  
- W I A _ T – no.  

Going back to T I A _ _  
- T I A M A – no.  
- T I A K A – no.  
- T I A B A – no.  
- T I A D A – no.  
- T I A F A – no.  
- T I A H A – no.  

Actually, TIBIA (the bone) is valid, but it’s obscure.

Let’s try _ I _ T A  
- B I G T A – no.  
- C I D T A – no.  
- D I G T A – no.  
- F I G T A – no.  
- H I D T A – no.  
- M I D T A – no.  

Wait, let me think of “ditia” – no, that’s not a word.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with I in position 2, and see which fit the constraints.

Common 5-letter words with I in position 2:
- ABIDE – no.  
- ACIDY – no.  
- ADMIT – A is 1, so no.  
- AGING – A is 1, no.

Let me think of “TIBIA” – this is a valid word (the bone), and it has:
- T I B I A  
But it has I in position 4 as well, and we already have I in position 2.  That’s allowed, but let’s check constraints:
- I is confirmed in position 2.  
- A must be in position 3 or 5.  In TIBIA, A is in 5.  
- T must be in 1, 4, or 5.  In TIBIA, T is in 1.  
- Letters used: T, I, B, I, A.  Only B is new.  
- No ruled-out letters.  

So TIBIA fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is TIBIA.",Guess 4: tibia -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) B(✓) I(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
