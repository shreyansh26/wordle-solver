### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-3 consonants to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This will help me quickly identify which vowels are present and their positions, while also checking R and S.

Another good alternative is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of S which is very common. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, I, M, B

Letters known to be in the word:
- L (from both guesses) – but L is NOT in position 2 (from CLIMB feedback) and NOT in position 5 (from UNTIL feedback).  
  So L must be in position 1 or 3 or 4.  
- I (from UNTIL feedback) – but I is NOT in position 3 (from CLIMB feedback).  
  So I must be in position 4 (confirmed by UNTIL) or position 2.  
  But from UNTIL feedback, I is in position 4 (✓), so that is fixed.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ I _ and must contain L in position 1 or 3.

Remaining letters (not ruled out yet):
D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains L in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
1. L _ _ I _
2. _ _ L I _

Let's brainstorm words for each pattern:

Pattern 1 (L _ _ I _):
- L _ _ I _ with remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q
  Possible words: LADGI (invalid), LF... hard to form.  
  Real words: LIVID (but V and D are allowed), LIVID uses I twice which is ok, but we don't know if I is allowed twice.  
  LIVID: L I V I D – but we don't have info about V or D yet.  
  Let's check: L I V I D – letters are L, I, V, I, D. All letters except L, I, V, D are allowed?  
  From the list, D, V are allowed. So LIVID is possible.

Pattern 2 (_ _ L I _):
- _ _ L I _ with remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q
  Possible words: FLICK (but C is out), GLYPH (but H is allowed), PLINK (but N is out), SLINK (but S is out), DLINK (invalid), FLUID (but U is out), GLIDE (but E is out), etc.  
  Real words: FLUID – but U is out, so no.  
  GLYPH – G, L, Y, P, H. All letters allowed.  
  PLINK – N is out.  
  SLINK – S is out.  
  So GLYPH is possible.

Between LIVID and GLYPH, both are valid based on current constraints.  
But we need to choose one. Let's pick GLYPH as it uses G, L, Y, P, H – all new letters except L and I (but I is already fixed in position 4).

Wait, GLYPH has I in position 4? No, GLYPH is G L Y P H – I is not in it. But we know I must be in position 4. So GLYPH is invalid because it doesn't have I in position 4.

Oops, I made a mistake. The word must have I in position 4. So for pattern 2 (_ _ L I _), we need _ _ L I _.  
Possible words:  
- F L _ I _ – but need a valid word.  
- D L _ I _ – DL...  
- P L _ I _ – PL...  
- V L _ I _ – VL... invalid.  
- W L _ I _ – WL... invalid.  
- H L _ I _ – HL... invalid.  
- K L _ I _ – KL... invalid.  
- J L _ I _ – JL... invalid.  
- Y L _ I _ – YL... invalid.  
- Z L _ I _ – ZL... invalid.  
- X L _ I _ – XL... invalid.  
- Q L _ I _ – QL... invalid.  

Real words with _ _ L I _:
- FLI... like FLING (but G is allowed, N is out), FLINT (N is out), FLISK (S is out), etc.  
- PLI... like PLING (N is out), PLIERS (E is out, S is out), etc.  
- KL... nothing.  
- SL... S is out.  
- BL... B is out.  
- CL... C is out.  

So FLING is possible: F L I N G – but N is out.  
So FLI... seems limited.  

Looking back at pattern 1 (L _ _ I _):
- L _ _ I _ with allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q  
  Possible words:  
  - LIVID – L I V I D – but V and D are allowed, and I is allowed in position 2?  
    But we don't know if I is allowed twice. The word could have two I's.  
  - LUGIA – but U is out.  
  - LYMPH – L Y M P H – but M is out.  
  - LIGAN – N is out.  
  - LIGNE – E is out.  
  - LIVOR – O is out.  
  - LIVID – seems the only valid word here.  

So LIVID is the best candidate.

Let's verify LIVID:
- L: allowed (not in position 2 or 5, and here it's in position 1 – ok)  
- I: allowed, and in position 4 – matches our constraint  
- V: allowed  
- I: allowed (second I)  
- D: allowed  

Thus, LIVID is valid.
