For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This combination should help identify which letters are in the word and their positions efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd)
- T and E are not in the word at all

So the secret word contains S, L, and A somewhere, but not in their SLATE positions (1, 2, 3 respectively), and does not contain T or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S, L, A but move their positions
2. Introduce new common letters to test
3. Avoid T and E

A good candidate is ""SCALD"":
- S moves to 2nd (was 1st)
- C is new common consonant
- A moves to 3rd (was 3rd - same, but feedback says A is wrong position, so this is bad)
Wait, A was 3rd and feedback says A is in wrong position, so A cannot be 3rd again.

Alternative: ""SALAD"" - but A would be 3rd again.

Better: ""LASER"" - but E is excluded.

Another approach: positions for S, L, A need to change.
Possible new positions:
S could be 2,3,4,5
L could be 1,3,4,5
A could be 2,4,5 (since 3 is excluded)

Try ""PLAID"":
- P new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)
No, L cannot stay 2nd.

Better: ""CLASP"":
- C new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""SCALP"":
- S 1st (same as before - bad)

Wait, S was 1st and feedback says S is in word but wrong position, so S cannot be 1st. So S must be 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, L was 2nd, so L must be 1,3,4,5.

A was 3rd, so A must be 2,4,5.

Let's try ""SCALP"" - S is 1st (same as before) - bad.

Better: ""PLANS"":
- P new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""SPALL"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

This is tricky. Let's try ""SALTY"" - but T is excluded.

Better: ""SALON"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

Alternative: ""ALARM"":
- A 1st (was 3rd, new position)
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Hmm, L cannot stay 2nd. Let's try ""ARSON"":
- A 1st (was 3rd)
- R new
- S 4th (was 1st, new position)
- O new
- N new

This seems good - tests new letters while moving S and A.

But let's check: S is in word (from feedback), so ARSON has S 4th - acceptable.
L must be somewhere, so ARSON has no L - bad.

We must include L. Let's try ""CLASP"" - L 2nd (same as before) - bad.

This is harder. Let's try ""SPALL"" - S 1st (same, bad)

Wait, maybe ""SALAD"" - but A 3rd is same as before.

Alternative: ""ASLUM"" - A 1st (was 3rd), S 2nd (was 1st), L 3rd (was 2nd), U new, M new.

This seems good - moves S, L, A to new positions and tests U, M.

But ""ASLUM"" is not a common word.

Better: ""SLANT"" - but T is excluded.

Alternative: ""SLANG"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

This is challenging. Let's try ""CLASP"" - L 2nd (same)

Another approach: use ""CRANE"" but E is excluded.

Better: ""CRANK"" - E excluded, K new.

But A was 3rd and must move.

Let's try ""CRANK"":

- A 3rd (same, bad)

Hmm.

This is tough. Let's try ""SCALD"" - A 3rd (same)

I think the best option is ""ARSON"" but it misses L. We must include L.

Let's try ""ALARM"":
- A 1st (was 3rd)
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""LARKS"":
- L 1st (was 2nd, new)
- A 2nd (was 3rd, new)
- R new
- K new
- S 5th (was 1st, new)

This includes L, A, S in new positions and tests R, K.

""LARKS"" seems good.

Based on the feedback:
- S, L, and A are in the word but in wrong positions (not 1st, 2nd, 3rd respectively)

From the combined feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S, L, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively
   - T and E are absent

2. LARKS → L(-) A(✓) R(x) K(x) S(-)
   - A is correctly in position 2
   - L and S are still in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
   - R and K are absent

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: S, L, A
- Letters definitely absent: T, E, R, K
- S cannot be in position 1 or 5
- L cannot be in position 1

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- Must contain S and L somewhere
- Cannot contain T, E, R, K

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is A), so 3 or 4
Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 2 is A), so 3, 4, 5

Let's look for words matching _ A _ _ _ with S and L somewhere, avoiding forbidden letters.

Some candidates:
- SALAD - but A is already in 2, and we can't have A in 3
- SABLE - contains B and L, but B is allowed
- SALTY - contains T (forbidden)
- SLANG - contains R (forbidden)
- PLANS - contains N and S, but L is in 2 (forbidden)

Wait, let's systematically build:
_ A _ _ _
Need to place S and L in remaining positions (3,4,5 for both), with no T,E,R,K.

Possible words:
- S A L V E - contains E (forbidden)
- S A L V A - contains A again
- S A L M O - possible
- P A L S E - contains E (forbidden)
- C A L S S - possible
- S A L L Y - possible
- M A L S S - possible

Among these, ""SALTY"" is invalid (T), ""SABLE"" is invalid (E), so ""SALVY"" is invalid (not a word).

A valid word is ""SALVY"" - but not common.

Another candidate: ""SALSA"" - contains S twice, but A is already in 2, and 4 would be S, 5 A - possible, but double S.

Better: ""SALSA"" is invalid (S twice, but allowed), but let's check letters: S, A, L, S, A - contains S, A, L, and no forbidden letters.

But we need to confirm if this is a valid word - ""SALSA"" is valid.

However, we already have A in position 2, and position 4 would be S, 5 A - but A could be repeated.

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""SALVO"" - contains O and V, no forbidden letters, positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) V(4) O(5) - but S cannot be in 1 (from SLATE feedback).

Thus, ""SALVO"" is invalid (S in 1).

Alternative: ""SALAD"" - but A in 3 is invalid (from SLATE).

Alternative: ""SALON"" - contains O, N - positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) O(4) N(5) - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALTY"" - invalid (T).

Next: ""SALSA"" - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALVY"" - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALAS"" - S in 1 invalid.

We need S not in 1 or 5, and L not in 1.

So possible positions:
S can be 3 or 4
L can be 3,4,5

Let's try:
- S A L _ _ : but L would be 3, S 1 invalid
- _ A S _ _ : S in 3
- _ A _ S _ : S in 4
- _ A _ _ L : L in 5

Let's find words in these patterns:

   - ""S A L Y S"" - invalid
   - ""S A L Z S"" - invalid

6. _ A _ _ L
   - Already checked, no valid words.

This is very restrictive. Let's reconsider possible words with A in 2, S and L somewhere, avoiding forbidden letters.

Valid dictionary words:
- ""SALSA"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid
- ""SABLE"" - E invalid
- ""SALAD"" - A in 3 invalid
- ""SALON"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""SALVE"" - E invalid
- ""SALVY"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""SALMY"" - contains Y, positions: S(1) invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid

Wait, let's think differently - maybe S is in 4, L in 3 or 5.

Example: _ A L S _
- ""C A L S O"" - invalid
- ""M A L S O"" - invalid
- ""P A L S E"" - invalid (E)
- ""B A L S A"" - invalid (A in 5)
- ""D A L S A"" - invalid
- ""F A L S A"" - invalid
- ""G A L S A"" - invalid
- ""H A L S A"" - invalid
- ""J A L S A"" - invalid
- ""K A L S A"" - invalid (K)
- ""L A L S A"" - invalid
- ""M A L S A"" - invalid
- ""N A L S A"" - invalid
- ""O A L S A"" - invalid
- ""Q A L S A"" - invalid
- ""R A L S A"" - invalid (R)
- ""S A L S A"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""T A L S A"" - invalid (T)
- ""U A L S A"" - invalid
- ""V A L S A"" - invalid
- ""W A L S A"" - invalid
- ""X A L S A"" - invalid
- ""Y A L S A"" - invalid
- ""Z A L S A"" - invalid

Another pattern: _ A _ L S
- ""C A P I L S"" - invalid
- ""M A J O L S"" - invalid
- ""P A N D L S"" - invalid
- ""B A N D L S"" - invalid
- ""S A L L S"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""C A L L S"" - invalid (A in 2)
- ""M A L L S"" - invalid
- ""P A L L S"" - invalid
- ""B A L L S"" - invalid
- ""D A L L S"" - invalid
- ""F A L L S"" - invalid
- ""G A L L S"" - invalid
- ""H A L L S"" - invalid
- ""J A L L S"" - invalid
- ""K A L L S"" - invalid (K)
- ""L A L L S"" - invalid
- ""M A L L S"" - invalid
- ""N A L L S"" - invalid
- ""O A L L S"" - invalid
- ""Q A L L S"" - invalid
- ""R A L L S"" - invalid (R)
- ""S A L L S"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""T A L L S"" - invalid (T)
- ""U A L L S"" - invalid
- ""V A L L S"" - invalid
- ""W A L L S"" - invalid
- ""X A L L S"" - invalid
- ""Y A L L S"" - invalid
- ""Z A L L S"" - invalid

This is very limiting. Let's try ""CABAS"" - but A is in 2, positions: C(1) A(2) B(3) A(4) S(5) - but A in 4 is allowed, S in 5 is allowed (S can be 3 or 4 from feedback, but 5 is allowed for S? Wait, feedback says S is in word but wrong position - in SLATE S was 1st, so S can be 2,3,4,5. But A is fixed at 2, so S can be 3 or 4 or 5.

""CABAS"" has S in 5 - this is allowed.

Let's check letters: C, A, B, A, S - no T, E, R, K - valid.

But ""CABAS"" is not a common word.

Another candidate: ""BAKAS"" - but K is forbidden.

""BASAL"" - contains A in 2, S in 3, A in 4, L in 5 - positions: B(1) A(2) S(3) A(4) L(5)
- Letters: B, A, S, A, L - no forbidden letters
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- L is in 5 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (correct)
- B is new
- This seems valid.

""BASAL"" is a valid word.

Let's verify:
- B A S A L
- A is in 2 (correct)
- S is in 3 (was 1 in SLATE, so allowed)
- L is in 5 (was 2 in SLATE, so allowed)
- No T, E, R, K
- Valid English word.

This seems the best option.

</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Contains S, L, A
- Does not contain T, E, R, K
- S cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from SLATE and LARKS)
- L cannot be in position 1 (from LARKS)

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""BASAL"".

<guess>BASAL</guess>",BASAL,"From the combined feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)

- S A L M O - possible
- P A L S E - contains E (forbidden)
- C A L S S - possible
- S A L L Y - possible
- M A L S S - possible

Among these, ""SALTY"" is invalid (T), ""SABLE"" is invalid (E), so ""SALVY"" is invalid (not a word).

A valid word is ""SALVY"" - but not common.

Thus, ""SALVO"" is invalid (S in 1).

Alternative: ""SALAD"" - but A in 3 is invalid (from SLATE).

Alternative: ""SALON"" - contains O, N - positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) O(4) N(5) - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALTY"" - invalid (T).

Next: ""SALSA"" - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALVY"" - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALAS"" - S in 1 invalid.

We need S not in 1 or 5, and L not in 1.

So possible positions:
S can be 3 or 4
L can be 3,4,5

This is very limiting. Let's try ""CABAS"" - but A is in 2, positions: C(1) A(2) B(3) A(4) S(5) - but A in 4 is allowed, S in 5 is allowed (S can be 3 or 4 from feedback, but 5 is allowed for S? Wait, feedback says S is in word but wrong position - in SLATE S was 1st, so S can be 2,3,4,5. But A is fixed at 2, so S can be 3 or 4 or 5.

""CABAS"" has S in 5 - this is allowed.

Let's check letters: C, A, B, A, S - no T, E, R, K - valid.

But ""CABAS"" is not a common word.

Another candidate: ""BAKAS"" - but K is forbidden.

""BASAL"" - contains A in 2, S in 3, A in 4, L in 5 - positions: B(1) A(2) S(3) A(4) L(5)
- Letters: B, A, S, A, L - no forbidden letters
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- L is in 5 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (correct)
- B is new
- This seems valid.

""BASAL"" is a valid word.

Let's verify:
- B A S A L
- A is in 2 (correct)
- S is in 3 (was 1 in SLATE, so allowed)
- L is in 5 (was 2 in SLATE, so allowed)
- No T, E, R, K
- Valid English word.

This seems the best option.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Contains S, L, A
- Does not contain T, E, R, K
- S cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from SLATE and LARKS)
- L cannot be in position 1 (from LARKS)

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""BASAL"".",Guess 3: BASAL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(✓) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This combination should help identify which letters are in the word and their positions efficiently.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd)
- T and E are not in the word at all

So the secret word contains S, L, and A somewhere, but not in their SLATE positions (1, 2, 3 respectively), and does not contain T or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S, L, A but move their positions
2. Introduce new common letters to test
3. Avoid T and E

A good candidate is ""SCALD"":
- S moves to 2nd (was 1st)
- C is new common consonant
- A moves to 3rd (was 3rd - same, but feedback says A is wrong position, so this is bad)
Wait, A was 3rd and feedback says A is in wrong position, so A cannot be 3rd again.

Alternative: ""SALAD"" - but A would be 3rd again.

Better: ""LASER"" - but E is excluded.

Another approach: positions for S, L, A need to change.
Possible new positions:
S could be 2,3,4,5
L could be 1,3,4,5
A could be 2,4,5 (since 3 is excluded)

Try ""PLAID"":
- P new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)
No, L cannot stay 2nd.

Better: ""CLASP"":
- C new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""SCALP"":
- S 1st (same as before - bad)

Wait, S was 1st and feedback says S is in word but wrong position, so S cannot be 1st. So S must be 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, L was 2nd, so L must be 1,3,4,5.

A was 3rd, so A must be 2,4,5.

Let's try ""SCALP"" - S is 1st (same as before) - bad.

Better: ""PLANS"":
- P new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""SPALL"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

This is tricky. Let's try ""SALTY"" - but T is excluded.

Better: ""SALON"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

Alternative: ""ALARM"":
- A 1st (was 3rd, new position)
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Hmm, L cannot stay 2nd. Let's try ""ARSON"":
- A 1st (was 3rd)
- R new
- S 4th (was 1st, new position)
- O new
- N new

This seems good - tests new letters while moving S and A.

But let's check: S is in word (from feedback), so ARSON has S 4th - acceptable.
L must be somewhere, so ARSON has no L - bad.

We must include L. Let's try ""CLASP"" - L 2nd (same as before) - bad.

Alternative: ""SCALD"" - A 3rd (same as before) - bad.

Better: ""SCALP"" - same issue.

Let's try ""FLASK"":
- F new
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""BLASP"" - B new, L 2nd (same)

This is harder. Let's try ""SPALL"" - S 1st (same, bad)

Wait, maybe ""SALAD"" - but A 3rd is same as before.

Alternative: ""ASLUM"" - A 1st (was 3rd), S 2nd (was 1st), L 3rd (was 2nd), U new, M new.

This seems good - moves S, L, A to new positions and tests U, M.

But ""ASLUM"" is not a common word.

Better: ""SLANT"" - but T is excluded.

Alternative: ""SLANG"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

This is challenging. Let's try ""CLASP"" - L 2nd (same)

Another approach: use ""CRANE"" but E is excluded.

Better: ""CRANK"" - E excluded, K new.

But A was 3rd and must move.

Let's try ""CRANK"":
- C new
- R new
- A 3rd (same, bad)

Hmm.

Alternative: ""SCARF"":
- S 1st (same, bad)

This is tough. Let's try ""SCALD"" - A 3rd (same)

I think the best option is ""ARSON"" but it misses L. We must include L.

Let's try ""ALARM"":
- A 1st (was 3rd)
- L 2nd (was 2nd - same, bad)

Alternative: ""LARKS"":
- L 1st (was 2nd, new)
- A 2nd (was 3rd, new)
- R new
- K new
- S 5th (was 1st, new)

This includes L, A, S in new positions and tests R, K.

""LARKS"" seems good.Based on the feedback:
- S, L, and A are in the word but in wrong positions (not 1st, 2nd, 3rd respectively)
- T and E are not in the word

A new guess that moves S, L, and A to different positions while introducing new common letters is ""LARKS"".

<guess>LARKS</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LARKS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(✓) R(x) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the combined feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S, L, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively
   - T and E are absent

2. LARKS → L(-) A(✓) R(x) K(x) S(-)
   - A is correctly in position 2
   - L and S are still in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
   - R and K are absent

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: S, L, A
- Letters definitely absent: T, E, R, K
- S cannot be in position 1 or 5
- L cannot be in position 1

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- Must contain S and L somewhere
- Cannot contain T, E, R, K

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is A), so 3 or 4
Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 2 is A), so 3, 4, 5

Let's look for words matching _ A _ _ _ with S and L somewhere, avoiding forbidden letters.

Some candidates:
- SALAD - but A is already in 2, and we can't have A in 3
- SABLE - contains B and L, but B is allowed
- SALTY - contains T (forbidden)
- SLANG - contains R (forbidden)
- PLANS - contains N and S, but L is in 2 (forbidden)

Wait, let's systematically build:
_ A _ _ _
Need to place S and L in remaining positions (3,4,5 for both), with no T,E,R,K.

Possible words:
- S A L V E - contains E (forbidden)
- S A L V A - contains A again
- S A L M O - possible
- P A L S E - contains E (forbidden)
- C A L S S - possible
- S A L L Y - possible
- M A L S S - possible

Among these, ""SALTY"" is invalid (T), ""SABLE"" is invalid (E), so ""SALVY"" is invalid (not a word).

A valid word is ""SALVY"" - but not common.

Another candidate: ""SALSA"" - contains S twice, but A is already in 2, and 4 would be S, 5 A - possible, but double S.

Better: ""SALSA"" is invalid (S twice, but allowed), but let's check letters: S, A, L, S, A - contains S, A, L, and no forbidden letters.

But we need to confirm if this is a valid word - ""SALSA"" is valid.

However, we already have A in position 2, and position 4 would be S, 5 A - but A could be repeated.

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""SALVO"" - contains O and V, no forbidden letters, positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) V(4) O(5) - but S cannot be in 1 (from SLATE feedback).

Thus, ""SALVO"" is invalid (S in 1).

Alternative: ""SALAD"" - but A in 3 is invalid (from SLATE).

Alternative: ""SALON"" - contains O, N - positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) O(4) N(5) - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALTY"" - invalid (T).

Next: ""SALSA"" - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALVY"" - S in 1 is invalid.

Next: ""SALAS"" - S in 1 invalid.

We need S not in 1 or 5, and L not in 1.

So possible positions:
S can be 3 or 4
L can be 3,4,5

Let's try:
- S A L _ _ : but L would be 3, S 1 invalid
- _ A S _ _ : S in 3
- _ A _ S _ : S in 4
- _ A _ _ L : L in 5

Let's find words in these patterns:

1. _ A S _ _
   - Possible: M A S S A (invalid A in 5), B A S S A (invalid), C A S S A (invalid)
   - ""MASSE"" - invalid (E)
   - ""BASSE"" - invalid (E)
   - ""CASSA"" - invalid (A in 5)
   - ""PASSE"" - invalid (E)
   - ""DASHE"" - invalid (E, H not forbidden)

2. _ A _ S _
   - ""C A V S E"" - invalid
   - ""P A U S E"" - invalid (E)
   - ""M A U S E"" - invalid (E)
   - ""M A J S Y"" - invalid
   - ""P A U S A"" - possible, but S in 4, A in 2 and 5 - but A in 5 is allowed
   - ""P A U S A"" - valid word ""PAUSE"" but E is forbidden.

3. _ A _ _ L

   - ""S A L W L"" - invalid
   - ""S A L X L"" - invalid
   - ""S A L Y L"" - invalid
   - ""S A L Z L"" - invalid

4. _ A S _ _ (but S in 3)

   - ""W A S S A"" - invalid
   - ""X A S S A"" - invalid
   - ""Y A S S A"" - invalid
   - ""Z A S S A"" - invalid

6. _ A _ _ L
   - Already checked, no valid words.

This is very restrictive. Let's reconsider possible words with A in 2, S and L somewhere, avoiding forbidden letters.

Valid dictionary words:
- ""SALSA"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid
- ""SABLE"" - E invalid
- ""SALAD"" - A in 3 invalid

- ""SALVY"" - S in 1 invalid
- ""SALMY"" - contains Y, positions: S(1) invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid
- ""SALTY"" - T invalid

Wait, let's think differently - maybe S is in 4, L in 3 or 5.

This is very limiting. Let's try ""CABAS"" - but A is in 2, positions: C(1) A(2) B(3) A(4) S(5) - but A in 4 is allowed, S in 5 is allowed (S can be 3 or 4 from feedback, but 5 is allowed for S? Wait, feedback says S is in word but wrong position - in SLATE S was 1st, so S can be 2,3,4,5. But A is fixed at 2, so S can be 3 or 4 or 5.

""CABAS"" has S in 5 - this is allowed.

Let's check letters: C, A, B, A, S - no T, E, R, K - valid.

- Letters: B, A, S, A, L - no forbidden letters
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- L is in 5 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (correct)
- B is new

""BASAL"" is a valid word.

This seems the best option.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Contains S, L, A
- Does not contain T, E, R, K
