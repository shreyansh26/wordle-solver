### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it includes O which is very common and appears in many words, while ""SLATE"" might be too focused on S and L. 

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess to maximize the chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.\n\nLooking at combinations, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. \n\nBetween these, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it includes O which is very common and appears in many words, while ""SLATE"" might be too focused on S and L. \n\nLet\'s go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess to maximize the chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (–)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- O is not in the word (x)\n- S is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is fixed at position 5.
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S are absent.

2. PLACE → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) C(x) E(✓)
   – L is fixed at position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3 (contradiction? no, original PLACE showed A in position 3 as ✓, so A is in position 3).
   – P and C are absent.
   – E is fixed at position 5.

3. FLAME → F(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
   – F is fixed at position 1.
   – L is confirmed at position 2.
   – A is confirmed at position 3.
   – M is absent.
   – E is fixed at position 5.

So the pattern is now completely determined:
F L A _ E

Only the 4th letter is unknown, and it must not be C, M, R, O, S (from earlier exclusions). Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words: FLAKE, FLANGE (6 letters), FLAXE (not valid), FLIBE (not valid), FLIDE (not valid), FLANE (not valid), FLAGE (valid), FLITE (valid), FLAKE (valid).

Among these, FLAKE is the most common and valid 5-letter word fitting F L A _ E.

Let’s try FLAKE.
