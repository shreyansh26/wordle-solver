For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

CRANE covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters. This seems like a strong first guess to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains R and E, does NOT contain C, A, or N, and places R and E in new positions.

Let’s brainstorm possible letters left: common consonants like S, T, L, D, B, G, M, P, etc., and vowels O, I, U (since A is out).

We need two more letters plus R and E, avoiding C, A, N.

One approach is to keep R and E but move them around. For example:
- Put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2)
- Put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

Let’s try to pick a word that repositions R and E and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""STORE"":
- S, T, O are new letters
- R is now in position 2 (allowed since it was in position 2 before but marked as wrong position, so now position 2 is allowed for R)
- E is now in position 5 (but feedback said E is in word but not in position 5, so this is bad)

Oops, E cannot be in position 5. Let’s rethink.

Try ""ROTES"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O, T, S are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- This uses R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters.

This seems like a good next guess.

Let’s try to pick a word that repositions R and E and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""STORE"":
- S, T, O are new letters
- R is now in position 2 (allowed since it was in position 2 before but marked as wrong position, so now position 2 is allowed for R)
- E is now in position 5 (but feedback said E is in word but not in position 5, so this is bad)

Oops, E cannot be in position 5. Let’s rethink.

Try ""ROTES"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O, T, S are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- This uses R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters.

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROTES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(✓) E(✓) S(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ROTES → R(-) O(-) T(✓) E(✓) S(x)
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions: _ _ T E _
- Letters in the word: R, E, T, O
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, S
- R is not in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is E, so R must be in position 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 5. Position 5 is R, so O must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must be: O _ T E R

Now we just need to fill position 2 with a letter that hasn't been ruled out. Available letters (common ones): D, L, B, G, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""OLDER"":
- O in position 1 (matches our deduction)
- L in position 2 (new letter)
- T in position 3 (correct)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- R in position 5 (correct)

This seems to fit all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   – C, A, N are absent.
   – R is present but not in position 2.
   – E is present but not in position 5.

2. ROTES → R(-) O(-) T(✓) E(✓) S(x)
   – T is in position 3 (locked).
   – E is in position 4 (locked).
   – R is present but not in position 1.
   – O is present but not in position 2.

3. OLDER → O(✓) L(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – O is in position 1 (locked).
   – E is in position 4 (locked).
   – R is in position 5 (locked).
   – L and D are absent.

Current pattern: O _ T E R

Letters known to be in the word: O, T, E, R  
Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, S, L, D

The blank (position 2) must be a letter that:
- has not been ruled out (not C, A, N, S, L, D)
- has not been placed yet (O, T, E, R are already positioned)

Common remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.
Vowels still available: I, U (A and E are already used/ruled out)

Let’s test a common consonant: “M” gives O M T E R – but “OMTER” is not a valid English word.  
Next: “B” → O B T E R – “OBTER” is not valid.  
Next: “H” → O H T E R – “OHTER” is not valid.  
Next: “P” → O P T E R – “OPTER” is valid (as in “optronic”).  
But “OPTER” uses P, which hasn’t been ruled out.

However, a more common word is “OUTER” – but U has not been ruled out, and “OUTER” fits perfectly: O U T E R.

Let’s verify:
- O is in position 1 (✓)
- U is new and allowed
- T in 3 (✓)
- E in 4 (✓)
- R in 5 (✓)

“OUTER” satisfies every constraint.
