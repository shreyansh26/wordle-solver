For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. The letters R, I, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next steps: test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) while maintaining the A in position 2.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: RAISE

Round 2: PLANT

We still need to test vowels O and U, plus common consonants like C, D, G, K, M.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern is now **M A _ _ _** (M and A are correct and in place).
2. Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H, O.
3. Remaining unused common letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with **M A** and uses only letters from the remaining set.

Another candidate: **MADAM** (but A is already fixed in position 2, and M is correct in position 1, so repeating M in position 4 would be allowed, but we have no info on D or G yet).

However, **MADAM** uses M, A, D, A, M. D is still untested and valid.

Between MAGGY and MADAM, MAGGY tests G (a common letter not yet used), while MADAM tests D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- I, S, E are NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. The letters R, I, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next steps: test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) while maintaining the A in position 2.

Possible candidates:
- PLANT (P, L, N, T tested; but T is common)
- CANTO (C, N, T, O tested)
- LADDO (but O is tested, and D is okay)
- GLOAT (G, L, O, T tested)

I'll choose PLANT because it tests P, L, N, T - all common letters not yet excluded, while keeping A in position 2.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: RAISE

→ Pattern: _ A _ _ _  
→ Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E

Round 2: PLANT  
P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
→ A is NOT in the correct 2nd position (but we already knew it must be in position 2 from RAISE, so this simply confirms A is in position 2)  
→ Additional letters definitely absent: P, L, N, T

So far:
- Fixed: A in position 2  
- Absent: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need to test vowels O and U, plus common consonants like C, D, G, K, M.

A good word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses fresh common letters is:
G A M O D → but that’s not a word  
C A M O D → not valid  
D A M O D → invalid  
G A M O → too short  
C A M O → invalid  
D A M O → invalid  

Let’s pick a valid word: C A M P O is invalid (P absent).  
How about C A M B O → not valid.  
D A M B O → invalid.  
G A M U → invalid.  
C A M U → invalid.  
H A M O → invalid.  
M A C H O → valid and uses M, C, H, O (all fresh).

MACHO fits _ A _ _ _ (it’s M A C H O) and tests M, C, H, O.

So:
Pattern: M A C H O  
Letters used: M, A, C, H, O  
All letters except A are new and not previously excluded.

This seems like the best next guess.

Let's interpret the new feedback on MADAM:

M(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(-)

1. M and A are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2, so this feedback reinforces that.
2. D is NOT in the word (x).
3. The second A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). However, we already know A must be in position 2 (from RAISE feedback), so this simply confirms A is indeed in position 2 and tells us A does not appear elsewhere in the word.
4. The final M is in the word but in the wrong position (-). But we know M is already confirmed in position 1, so this also just reconfirms M is in position 1.

Therefore, the pattern is still M A _ _ _, and we now know D is not in the word.  
Letters already excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H, O, D.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with MA and using only these remaining letters.  
Possible candidates:

- M A B _ _ → MA B Y L (invalid), MA B L Y (invalid)
- M A F _ _ → MA F R Y (R absent)
- M A G _ _ → MA G G Y (valid, uses G and Y)
- M A K _ _ → MA K E S (E, S absent)
- M A U _ _ → MA U R I (R, I absent)
- M A V _ _ → MA V E N (E absent)
- M A W _ _ → MA W K I (I absent)
- M A Y _ _ → MA Y B Y (invalid)

The only valid word fitting these constraints is **MAGGY**.

However, let's verify:  
M, A, G, G, Y  
- M and A are correct in positions 1 and 2  
- G and Y are new letters not previously excluded  
- This satisfies all feedback so far

Therefore, the next logical guess is MAGGY.

M(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(-)

1. M and A are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2, so this feedback reinforces that.
2. D is NOT in the word (x).
3. The second A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). However, we already know A must be in position 2 (from RAISE feedback), so this simply confirms A is indeed in position 2 and tells us A does not appear elsewhere in the word.
4. The final M is in the word but in the wrong position (-). But we know M is already confirmed in position 1, so this also just reconfirms M is in position 1.

Therefore, the pattern is still M A _ _ _, and we now know D is not in the word.  
Letters already excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H, O, D.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with MA and using only these remaining letters.  
Possible candidates:

- M A B _ _ → MA B Y L (invalid), MA B L Y (invalid)
- M A F _ _ → MA F R Y (R absent)
- M A G _ _ → MA G G Y (valid, uses G and Y)
- M A K _ _ → MA K E S (E, S absent)
- M A U _ _ → MA U R I (R, I absent)
- M A V _ _ → MA V E N (E absent)
- M A W _ _ → MA W K I (I absent)
- M A Y _ _ → MA Y B Y (invalid)

The only valid word fitting these constraints is **MAGGY**.

However, let's verify:  
M, A, G, G, Y  
- M and A are correct in positions 1 and 2  
- G and Y are new letters not previously excluded  
- This satisfies all feedback so far

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- I, S, E are NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. The letters R, I, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next steps: test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) while maintaining the A in position 2.

Possible candidates:
- PLANT (P, L, N, T tested; but T is common)
- CANTO (C, N, T, O tested)
- LADDO (but O is tested, and D is okay)
- GLOAT (G, L, O, T tested)

I'll choose PLANT because it tests P, L, N, T - all common letters not yet excluded, while keeping A in position 2.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: RAISE  
R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ Pattern: _ A _ _ _  
→ Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E

Round 2: PLANT  
P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
→ A is NOT in the correct 2nd position (but we already knew it must be in position 2 from RAISE, so this simply confirms A is in position 2)  
→ Additional letters definitely absent: P, L, N, T

So far:
- Fixed: A in position 2  
- Absent: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need to test vowels O and U, plus common consonants like C, D, G, K, M.

A good word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses fresh common letters is:
G A M O D → but that’s not a word  
C A M O D → not valid  
D A M O D → invalid  
G A M O → too short  
C A M O → invalid  
D A M O → invalid  

Let’s pick a valid word: C A M P O is invalid (P absent).  
How about C A M B O → not valid.  
D A M B O → invalid.  
G A M U → invalid.  
C A M U → invalid.  
H A M O → invalid.  
M A C H O → valid and uses M, C, H, O (all fresh).

MACHO fits _ A _ _ _ (it’s M A C H O) and tests M, C, H, O.

So:
Pattern: M A C H O  
Letters used: M, A, C, H, O  
All letters except A are new and not previously excluded.

This seems like the best next guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern is now **M A _ _ _** (M and A are correct and in place).
2. Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H, O.
3. Remaining unused common letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with **M A** and uses only letters from the remaining set.  
Scanning common words beginning with MA:

- M A B _ _ → M A B Y L (invalid), M A B L E (E absent), etc.
- M A D _ _ → M A D U R (invalid), M A D U L (invalid)
- M A F _ _ → M A F R Y (R absent)
- M A G _ _ → M A G G Y (valid, but uses G twice)
- M A K _ _ → M A K E S (E, S absent)
- M A N _ _ → N already absent
- M A U _ _ → M A U R I (I absent)
- M A V _ _ → M A V E N (E absent)
- M A W _ _ → M A W K I (I absent)
- M A D _ _ → M A D U R (invalid)

The only valid word that fits and uses only allowed letters appears to be **MAGGY** (though it repeats G).  
Another candidate: **MADAM** (but A is already fixed in position 2, and M is correct in position 1, so repeating M in position 4 would be allowed, but we have no info on D or G yet).

However, **MADAM** uses M, A, D, A, M. D is still untested and valid.

Between MAGGY and MADAM, MAGGY tests G (a common letter not yet used), while MADAM tests D.

Let’s choose **MADAM** as it tests the new letter D without repeating any other letters unnecessarily.

(Note: MADAM is a valid English word meaning ""my dear"".)

From the feedback on MAGGY:

M(✓) A(✓) G(✓) G(-) Y(x)

1. M, A, G are confirmed in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
2. The fourth G is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since G is already confirmed in position 3, this implies there is another G elsewhere in the word, but position 4 is currently occupied by G (which is already confirmed correct in position 3), so this feedback is a bit ambiguous. However, the key point is that Y is NOT in the word (x).
3. Therefore, the pattern is now M A G _ _ and we need to find a valid 5-letter word starting with MAG that uses letters not yet excluded.

Letters already excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H, O, D, Y.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, J, K, U, V, W, Z.

Possible words starting with MAG:
- MAGMA (but M is already in position 1 and we don't know about position 4 yet)
- MAGMA uses M, A, G, M, A. We know M and A are correct in positions 1 and 2, G in 3. The fourth M would be a new position (position 4) and the fifth A would be position 5. Since A is already confirmed in position 2, but we don't have info that A can't appear again, but from MADAM feedback we saw that A appears only once (since the second A in MADAM was marked as wrong position, implying A only appears in position 2). So A can't appear again, so MAGMA is invalid (has A in position 5).

Other options:
- MAGMA is invalid because A can't appear again.
- MAGB_ - but we need a valid word.
- MAGF_ - no valid words.
- MAGJ_ - no valid words.
- MAGK_ - no valid words.
- MAGU_ - no valid words.
- MAGV_ - no valid words.
- MAGW_ - no valid words.
- MAGZ_ - no valid words.

Wait, let's think of actual valid 5-letter words starting with MAG and using remaining letters:
- MAGMA - invalid as explained
- MAGGI - but I is excluded
- MAGGS - S is excluded
- MAGMA is the only valid word, but it's invalid due to A appearing twice.

This suggests we might need to reconsider. Maybe the feedback allows A to appear again, but from MADAM we saw A in position 4 was marked as wrong position, implying A is only in position 2. So A can't appear again.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, J, K, U, V, W, Z.

Possible combinations for positions 4 and 5:
- MAGB_ - need a letter, but no valid words
- MAGF_ - no valid words
- MAGK_ - no valid words
- MAGU_ - no valid words
- MAGV_ - no valid words
- MAGW_ - no valid words
- MAGZ_ - no valid words

This seems problematic. Maybe we missed a word. Let me think differently - perhaps the word is MAGMA, even though it has A twice. But from MADAM feedback, A appears only once (position 2), so MAGMA would have A in position 5, which would be invalid.

Wait, maybe the word is MAGMA, and the feedback allows A to appear again. Let me re-examine MADAM feedback:
MADAM -> M(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(-)
The second A in MADAM was in position 4 and was marked as (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. This does not necessarily preclude A from appearing in position 5, as long as it's not in position 4. So MAGMA would have A in position 5, which is allowed.

Similarly, the final M in MADAM was in position 5 and was marked as (-), meaning M is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent with M being in position 1.

So MAGMA seems valid:
M(1) A(2) G(3) M(4) A(5)
- M confirmed in 1, A in 2, G in 3
- A in 5 is allowed (not restricted by previous feedback)
- M in 4 is allowed (not restricted by previous feedback)

Thus, MAGMA is a valid next guess.

- MAGMA (but M is already in position 1 and we don't know about position 4 yet)
- MAGMA uses M, A, G, M, A. We know M and A are correct in positions 1 and 2, G in 3. The fourth M would be a new position (position 4) and the fifth A would be position 5. Since A is already confirmed in position 2, but we don't have info that A can't appear again, but from MADAM feedback we saw that A appears only once (since the second A in MADAM was marked as wrong position, implying A only appears in position 2). So A can't appear again, so MAGMA is invalid (has A in position 5).

Other options:
- MAGMA is invalid because A can't appear again.
- MAGB_ - but we need a valid word.
- MAGF_ - no valid words.
- MAGJ_ - no valid words.
- MAGK_ - no valid words.
- MAGU_ - no valid words.
- MAGV_ - no valid words.
- MAGW_ - no valid words.
- MAGZ_ - no valid words.

Wait, let's think of actual valid 5-letter words starting with MAG and using remaining letters:
- MAGMA - invalid as explained
- MAGGI - but I is excluded
- MAGGS - S is excluded
- MAGMA is the only valid word, but it's invalid due to A appearing twice.

This suggests we might need to reconsider. Maybe the feedback allows A to appear again, but from MADAM we saw A in position 4 was marked as wrong position, implying A is only in position 2. So A can't appear again.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, J, K, U, V, W, Z.

Possible combinations for positions 4 and 5:
- MAGB_ - need a letter, but no valid words
- MAGF_ - no valid words
- MAGK_ - no valid words
- MAGU_ - no valid words
- MAGV_ - no valid words
- MAGW_ - no valid words
- MAGZ_ - no valid words

This seems problematic. Maybe we missed a word. Let me think differently - perhaps the word is MAGMA, even though it has A twice. But from MADAM feedback, A appears only once (position 2), so MAGMA would have A in position 5, which would be invalid.

Wait, maybe the word is MAGMA, and the feedback allows A to appear again. Let me re-examine MADAM feedback:
MADAM -> M(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(-)
The second A in MADAM was in position 4 and was marked as (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. This does not necessarily preclude A from appearing in position 5, as long as it's not in position 4. So MAGMA would have A in position 5, which is allowed.

Similarly, the final M in MADAM was in position 5 and was marked as (-), meaning M is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent with M being in position 1.

So MAGMA seems valid:
M(1) A(2) G(3) M(4) A(5)
- M confirmed in 1, A in 2, G in 3
- A in 5 is allowed (not restricted by previous feedback)
- M in 4 is allowed (not restricted by previous feedback)

Thus, MAGMA is a valid next guess.",Guess 6: MAGMA -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) G(✓) M(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
