### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word

   - L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (-)  
   - I is in the word but not in position 2 (-)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word  
   - S, A, T, N

So the secret word must contain {E, L, I, D} and one more letter that has not been tried yet and is not S, A, T, or N.

Positions so far:
- Position 4 = E

- D cannot be in position 5 → possible positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is E) → 1, 2, 3

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- E (fixed in position 4)

Letters that are in the word but whose positions we still don’t know:
- L (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 from CRUEL feedback)  
- I (cannot be in position 2 from LINED)  
- D (cannot be in position 5 from LINED)  
- R (from CRUEL: R is in the word but not in position 2)

Letters we have ruled out entirely:
S, A, T, N, C, U

So the set of letters that must appear is {E, L, I, D, R}, with the constraints:
- E is at position 4
- L can only be in position 3 (since 1, 2, 5 are forbidden)
- I cannot be in position 2
- D cannot be in position 5
- R is somewhere, but not position 2

Given E is fixed at 4 and L must be at 3, the word looks like: _ _ L E _

We still need to place I and D in positions 1 and/or 5 (but D cannot be at 5, so D must be at 1 and I at 5), and R must go into position 2.

That gives us: D R L E I

Let’s check:
- D at 1 (allowed)  
- R at 2 (allowed, since R only can’t be at 2 from CRUEL, but we’re placing it at 2 now – wait, that’s exactly the forbidden position. So DRLEI is invalid.)

Let me re-evaluate placement.

With E at 4 and L at 3, the pattern is: _ _ L E _

We need to place I and D in positions 1 and 2 (since 5 is forbidden for D and I can’t be at 2), so:
- I must be at 1 or 5 (but 5 is allowed for I)  
- D must be at 1 or 2 (but can’t be at 5)

But we have only two empty slots (1 and 2) and two letters to place (I and D).

Possible permutations:
1. I at 1, D at 2 → I D L E _
2. D at 1, I at 2 → D I L E _

Now R must go into the remaining slot (position 5).

So candidates:
- IDLE_ with R at 5 → IDLER (but we have only 5 letters and already have I,D,L,E,R – that’s 5 letters. So IDLER is 5 letters and fits.)

Check constraints:
- E at 4 (✓)  
- L at 3 (allowed)  
- I at 1 (allowed)  
- D at 2 (allowed)  
- R at 5 (allowed, and R is in the word)

This seems valid.

Another candidate would be D I L E R → DILER, but that’s not a common word. IDLER is valid.

So the next guess is IDLER.

Letters that are in the word but whose positions we still don’t know:

- D (cannot be in position 5 from LINED)

Letters we have ruled out entirely:

So the set of letters that must appear is {E, L, I, D, R}, with the constraints:
- E is at position 4
- L can only be in position 3 (since 1, 2, 5 are forbidden)
- I cannot be in position 2
- D cannot be in position 5
- R is somewhere, but not position 2

Given E is fixed at 4 and L must be at 3, the word looks like: _ _ L E _

We still need to place I and D in positions 1 and/or 5 (but D cannot be at 5, so D must be at 1 and I at 5), and R must go into position 2.

That gives us: D R L E I

Let’s check:
- D at 1 (allowed)  
- R at 2 (allowed, since R only can’t be at 2 from CRUEL, but we’re placing it at 2 now – wait, that’s exactly the forbidden position. So DRLEI is invalid.)

Let me re-evaluate placement.

With E at 4 and L at 3, the pattern is: _ _ L E _

We need to place I and D in positions 1 and 2 (since 5 is forbidden for D and I can’t be at 2), so:
- I must be at 1 or 5 (but 5 is allowed for I)  
- D must be at 1 or 2 (but can’t be at 5)

But we have only two empty slots (1 and 2) and two letters to place (I and D).

Possible permutations:
1. I at 1, D at 2 → I D L E _
2. D at 1, I at 2 → D I L E _

Now R must go into the remaining slot (position 5).

So candidates:
- IDLE_ with R at 5 → IDLER (but we have only 5 letters and already have I,D,L,E,R – that’s 5 letters. So IDLER is 5 letters and fits.)

Check constraints:
- E at 4 (✓)  
- L at 3 (allowed)  
- I at 1 (allowed)  
- D at 2 (allowed)  
- R at 5 (allowed, and R is in the word)

This seems valid.

Another candidate would be D I L E R → DILER, but that’s not a common word. IDLER is valid.

So the next guess is IDLER.",Guess 4: IDLER -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) D(✓) L(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
