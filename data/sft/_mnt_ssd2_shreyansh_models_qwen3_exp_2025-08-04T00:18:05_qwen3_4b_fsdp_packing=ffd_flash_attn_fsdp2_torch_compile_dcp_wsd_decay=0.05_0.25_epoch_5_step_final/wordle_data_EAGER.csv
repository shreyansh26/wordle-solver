### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at the most common letters in English words, E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are frequently used. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these high-frequency letters.

A good first guess would be ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter overall

This combination should give me good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (1st letter) – x → S is not in the word at all.
- L (2nd letter) – x → L is not in the word at all.
- A (3rd letter) – - → A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.
- T (4th letter) – x → T is not in the word at all.
- E (5th letter) – - → E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (somewhere other than positions 3 and 5, respectively)
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T

I now want a new word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions from before.
2. Avoids S, L, T.
3. Introduces other common letters to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- E is now in position 1 (not 5)
- A is now in position 2 (not 3)
- Uses common consonants R and Y
- Avoids S, L, T

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - E is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in position 2 (✓)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - S, L, T, Y (from both guesses)

3. Additional information:
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 (-)

So the pattern so far is:
E A _ _ _

with the remaining three letters chosen from the unused pool (excluding S, L, T, Y).  
Common remaining consonants include D, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

I want a word that:
- Starts with EA
- Uses R in one of positions 4 or 5
- Introduces a new consonant to test

A good candidate is “EARDY” but Y is already ruled out.  
Next: “EARNY” – Y is out.  
Try “EARLY” again – Y is out.  
Instead, let’s try “EARDY” is invalid (Y out).  
Try “EARED” – uses D, keeps R in 4th spot.

But “EARED” repeats E, which is fine, but we need to test a new consonant.  
Better to test N or D or C.

A better choice: “EANED” – but N is common and fits, but R must appear somewhere.

Let’s construct: EA _ R _.  
Possible endings: EA R _ _ – need a consonant and a vowel/consonant.

Try “EAGER” – uses G, keeps R in 5th spot, introduces G.

This seems optimal: starts with EA, places R in 5th (allowed), introduces G.
