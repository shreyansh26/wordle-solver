### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination covers 5 different common letters and 3 vowels (A, E) which helps narrow down possibilities quickly. Other strong first guesses could be ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""SLATE"" seems slightly more balanced.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all  
- L (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- A (x) – not in the word  
- T (x) – not in the word  
- E (x) – not in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains the letter L somewhere other than position 2.  
- The letters S, A, T, E are NOT in the word.  
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.  

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the L in a different position (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).  
2. Introduce new common letters that we haven’t tested yet (R, O, I, N, C, U, D, etc.).  
3. Avoid S, A, T, E entirely.  

A word that satisfies these is “FLING”:
- F – new letter  
- L – stays in the word (position 2 → now position 2 is L, but feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2, so this is actually bad because we’re putting L back in position 2).  

Let me rethink: L cannot be in position 2, so we need to move it elsewhere.  
A better word is “CLIMB”:
- C – new letter  
- L – in position 2 (still bad, same issue).  

Another option: “PLUMB”:
- P – new letter  
- L – in position 2 (still bad).  

“BULGY”:
- B – new letter  
- U – new letter  
- L – in position 3 (acceptable)  
- G – new letter  
- Y – new letter  

This avoids S, A, T, E and places L in position 3.  

But let’s pick a more common word: “CLUNK”:
- C – new  
- L – in position 2 (bad).  

“FLOUR”:
- F – new  
- L – in position 2 (bad).  

“DROWN”:
- D – new  
- R – new  
- O – new  
- W – new  
- N – new  
But it lacks L.  

“GLOOM”:
- G – new  
- L – in position 2 (bad).  

“CLOPS” – contains S (bad).  

“BLOND”:
- B – new  
- L – in position 2 (bad).  

“FLUNK”:
- F – new  
- L – in position 2 (bad).  

“LURCH”:
- L – in position 1 (acceptable)  
- U, R, C, H – all new letters  

This seems perfect: L is now in position 1, and we test U, R, C, H.  

But let’s double-check:  
- L is in the word (from feedback) and not in position 2, so position 1 is allowed.  
- Avoids S, A, T, E.  
- Tests 4 new letters (U, R, C, H).  

Thus, “LURCH” is a strong next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, U, R, C, H  
2. The letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from L(-) in both guesses).  
   Therefore L must be in position 3, 4 or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains L in one of positions 3, 4, or 5  
- Uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out (no S, A, T, E, U, R, C, H)  
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain: D, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Candidate letters left: D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We want common ones: D, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try placing L in position 3 and build a word:
- _ _ L _ _
Possible: F, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y

A good word using these constraints is “FLING” but we already ruled out F and I are okay, but we need to check:
- F is allowed (not ruled out)  
- L is allowed in position 3  
- I, N, G are allowed  
But we already have I and G in “FLING” but we haven’t used them yet.

Wait, let’s pick a word that uses fresh common letters.  
How about “GLIMP”?  
- G, L, I, M, P – all allowed  
- L is in position 2 which we know is wrong, so skip.

Better: “BLOND” – but B is allowed, L in position 2 is wrong.

Better: “DOLLY” – but L is in positions 2 and 4, position 2 is wrong.

Better: “FOLLY” – same issue with L in position 4 (but position 2 is wrong, position 4 is okay).

But “FOLLY” has two L’s – not ideal.

Better: “MOLLY” – same issue.

Better: “GOLLY” – same.

Let’s try “FILMY”:
- F, I, L, M, Y – all allowed  
- L is in position 3 (acceptable)  
- Uses 4 new letters (F, I, M, Y) compared to previous ones.

This seems good.

But let’s double-check:
- F – not ruled out  
- I – not ruled out  
- L – must be in word, position 3 is allowed  
- M – not ruled out  
- Y – not ruled out  

Thus, “FILMY” is a valid next guess.

<guess>FILMY</guess>",FILMY,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, U, R, C, H  
2. The letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from L(-) in both guesses).  
   Therefore L must be in position 3, 4 or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains L in one of positions 3, 4, or 5  
- Uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out (no S, A, T, E, U, R, C, H)  
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain: D, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Candidate letters left: D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We want common ones: D, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try placing L in position 3 and build a word:
- _ _ L _ _
Possible: F, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y

A good word using these constraints is “FLING” but we already ruled out F and I are okay, but we need to check:
- F is allowed (not ruled out)  
- L is allowed in position 3  
- I, N, G are allowed  
But we already have I and G in “FLING” but we haven’t used them yet.

Wait, let’s pick a word that uses fresh common letters.  
How about “GLIMP”?  
- G, L, I, M, P – all allowed  
- L is in position 2 which we know is wrong, so skip.

Better: “BLOND” – but B is allowed, L in position 2 is wrong.

Better: “DOLLY” – but L is in positions 2 and 4, position 2 is wrong.

Better: “FOLLY” – same issue with L in position 4 (but position 2 is wrong, position 4 is okay).

But “FOLLY” has two L’s – not ideal.

Better: “MOLLY” – same issue.

Better: “GOLLY” – same.

Let’s try “FILMY”:
- F, I, L, M, Y – all allowed  
- L is in position 3 (acceptable)  
- Uses 4 new letters (F, I, M, Y) compared to previous ones.

This seems good.

But let’s double-check:
- F – not ruled out  
- I – not ruled out  
- L – must be in word, position 3 is allowed  
- M – not ruled out  
- Y – not ruled out  

Thus, “FILMY” is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: FILMY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
