### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters, ideally with no duplicates to test as many letters as possible. ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

I\'ll pick a word that uses several of these common letters, ideally with no duplicates to test as many letters as possible. ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is not in the word.\n- R(x) → R is not in the word.\n- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 4.\n- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo far we know:\n- S is fixed in position 4.\n- O and E are in the word but are misplaced (O not in 3, E not in 5).\n- Letters A and R are not in the word at all.\n\nNext, I want a word that:\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(-)
2. OCEAN → O(-) C(x) E(✓) A(x) N(x)
3. DOESY → D(x) O(✓) E(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)

What we now know for certain:

- Letters not in the word: A, R, C, N, D
- Letters in the word and in their correct positions (from DOESY):
  – O is in position 2
  – E is in position 3
  – S is in position 4
  – Y is in position 5
- Therefore, the word has the pattern: _ O E S Y
- The only remaining position is the first letter, which we have not yet tested.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a letter we haven’t ruled out (not A, R, C, N, D) and fits the pattern _ O E S Y.

Possible first letters (from the remaining alphabet): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
