### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: very common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but NOT in the 5th position
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not in the 5th spot)
2. Avoids S, L, A, T
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let me try a word with E in position 1, 2, 3 or 4, and other common letters. ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:
- C, R, N are common consonants
- E is in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback)
- Avoids S, L, A, T

But wait, ""CRANE"" has A, which we know is not in the word. Let me rethink.

Better options:
- ""MERGE"" - has E in position 2 and 4, but G is less common
- ""NERVE"" - has E in positions 2 and 5, but 5 is bad for E
- ""CHORE"" - has O, E in positions 3 and 5, but 5 is bad for E

- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, D, I, N
- Allowed letters (among common ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The word must contain E and R.
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it’s not in 4 or 5).
- R can be in positions 1-4 (since it’s not in 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses E and R exactly once each (since we only have the negative feedback for those letters, not how many times they appear).
- Avoids all forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, D, I, N.
- Uses other allowed letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: O, U (besides E which we already know is present)

Let’s try to place E in position 2 and R in position 3, and fill the rest with common allowed letters:

E _ R _ _ → _ E R _ _ (positions 1,2,3)
Possible: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y for the blanks.

A word that fits: ""CERUM"" – but that’s not valid.
""PERCH"" – uses P, E, R, C, H – all allowed letters, E in position 2, R in position 3.

""PERCH"" is a valid 5-letter word, uses P, E, R, C, H – none of the forbidden letters, and positions E and R to test new placements.

Let’s go with PERCH.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. DINER → D(x) I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-)
   - Forbidden letters add: D, I, N
   - E is in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5 (so positions 1, 2, or 3).
   - R is in the word, but not in position 5.

3. PERCH → P(✓) E(✓) R(✓) C(x) H(x)
   - P is correct in position 1.
   - E is correct in position 2.
   - R is correct in position 3.
   - C and H are not in the word.

So the word starts with PER and we need to find the last two letters.

Known pattern: P E R _ _

Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, D, I, N, C, H

Allowed letters left: B, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters that are not yet excluded and form a valid 5-letter word starting with PER.

Possible endings:
- PER + B + O → PERBO (invalid)
- PER + K + E → PERKE (invalid)
- PER + F + O → PERFO (invalid)
- PER + M + E → PERME (invalid)
- PER + G + O → PERGO (invalid)

Wait, let's think of valid English words that start with PER and have 5 letters:
- PERCH (already guessed, C and H excluded)
- PERKY (K and Y are allowed)
- PERKY: P(✓) E(✓) R(✓) K(-) Y(-) – but K and Y haven't been tested yet.
- PERMY: not a valid word
- PERGO: not a valid word
- PERFO: not a valid word
- PERMA: not a valid word
- PERVY: not a valid word
- PERGE: not a valid word
- PERBU: not a valid word

The only valid word left seems to be PERKY, as K and Y haven't been ruled out yet.

Let's check:
- K: not in the forbidden list
- Y: not in the forbidden list

So PERKY is a valid guess to test K and Y in positions 4 and 5.
