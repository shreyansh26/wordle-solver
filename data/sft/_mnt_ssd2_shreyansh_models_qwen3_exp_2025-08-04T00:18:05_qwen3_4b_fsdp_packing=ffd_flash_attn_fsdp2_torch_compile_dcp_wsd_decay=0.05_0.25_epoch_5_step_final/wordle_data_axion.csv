For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Possible candidates:
- BANDA (but A is repeated and we don't know if A is repeated)
- MANIA (contains A and N, tests new letters M, I)
- PANDA (but D is untested)
- GANJA (but J is less common)
- MANIA seems good as it tests M and I while keeping A and N.

Let's check MANIA:
- M – new letter

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

A good next guess could be “RANCH”:
- R – common consonant
- A – known to be in the word, now in position 2
- N – common consonant
- C – common consonant
- H – common consonant

This tests five new letters (R, N, C, H) plus re-tests A in a different position.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) N(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RANCH → R(x) A(-) N(-) C(x) H(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, C, H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, C, H
- Letters known to be in the word: A, N
- A is not in position 2 or 3.
- N is not in position 3.

We need a word that:
- Contains A and N.
- A is in position 1, 4, or 5.
- N is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only letters that haven't been eliminated.

Looking at remaining common letters: D, G, B, M, P, O, I, U, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- BANDA (but A is repeated and we don't know if A is repeated)
- MANIA (contains A and N, tests new letters M, I)
- PANDA (but D is untested)
- GANJA (but J is less common)
- MANIA seems good as it tests M and I while keeping A and N.

Let's check MANIA:
- M – new letter
- A – known to be in word, now in position 2 (but we know A is not in 2 from RANCH feedback). Oops, A is in position 2 in MANIA which we already know is wrong. Need to adjust.

Better candidate: PANIC
- P – new
- A – known, now in position 1 (acceptable, since 1 is allowed for A)
- N – known, now in position 2 (acceptable, since 3 is not allowed for N but 2 is fine)
- I – new
- C – already eliminated (from RANCH feedback), so C is out. PANIC is invalid.

Next: ANGEL – but E and L are eliminated.

Next: AUDIO – but O and U are new, but D is new as well, but this has U and O which are vowels but we need to test consonants.

Better: GONNA – but double N might not be useful.

Let's think systematically:
We need a word with A and N, A not in 2 or 3, N not in 3.

Possible positions:
A: 1, 4, or 5
N: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

Let's try A in 1, N in 2: AN _ _ _
Possible: ANKLE – but K, L, E have issues (L and E eliminated)
ANKLE: L and E are eliminated, so invalid.

A in 1, N in 4: _ _ _ N A
Possible: DUNNA – but D, U are new, but N is repeated
MUNNA – similar issue

A in 1, N in 5: _ _ _ _ A
Possible: BUNNY – but Y is new, but N is repeated and we don't know if N is repeated
DUNNY – same issue

A in 4, N in 1: N _ _ A _
Possible: NURGA – but G is new, U is new
NIGMA – but M is new, I is new

A in 4, N in 2: _ N _ A _
Possible: BONNA – but B, O are new, N is repeated
DINER – but I, D, R (R eliminated)
MINER – R eliminated

A in 5, N in 1: N _ _ _ A
Possible: NIGMA – M, I, G are new
NODIA – D, I, O are new

Let's pick NIGMA:
- N – known, position 1 (acceptable)
- I – new
- G – new
- M – new
- A – known, position 5 (acceptable)

This tests three new letters (I, G, M) while placing A in position 5 and N in position 1.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have tested so far:
S, L, T, E, R, C, H, G, M

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
S, L, T, E, R, C, H, G, M

Letters that ARE in the word (✓), but whose exact positions are still unknown:
A, N, I

So the secret word contains the letters A, N, I exactly once each (we have no evidence of duplicates yet), and none of the eliminated letters.

Position constraints we have gathered:
- A is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from RANCH and NIGMA feedback).
- N is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from RANCH and NIGMA feedback).
- I is NOT in position 2 (from NIGMA feedback).

Remaining alphabet letters that are still allowed:
B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the known letters A, N, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses each of A, N, I exactly once.
2. Uses two additional letters from the still-allowed set.
3. Places A only in positions 1, 4, or 5.
4. Places N only in positions 2 or 4 or 5.
5. Places I only in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps A, N, I in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
- Adds two fresh, common consonants from the still-allowed set.

A good candidate is “FAINT”:
- F and T are both still allowed (T was only eliminated in earlier guesses, but T itself was marked ✗ in SLATE, so T is out). Oops, T is eliminated.

Next candidate: “FIANA” – but A repeats, and we don’t know if A is repeated.

Better: “JINNY” – but Y is allowed, N repeats, and we don’t know about duplicates.

Let’s try “PAINT”:
- P is allowed.
- A in position 2 is NOT allowed (A cannot be in 2). Reject.

Try “FAKIN”:
- F, K allowed.
- A in 1, K in 2, I in 3, N in 4 – positions satisfy constraints.

“FAKIN” is a valid English word (means “to fake” or “to deceive”) and meets all constraints.

Therefore, we’ll guess FAKIN.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (x) – not in the word at all
- A (-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (x) – not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A, but A is not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the third position.
2. Does not use S, L, T, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

A good next guess could be “RANCH”:
- R – common consonant
- A – known to be in the word, now in position 2
- N – common consonant
- C – common consonant
- H – common consonant

This tests five new letters (R, N, C, H) plus re-tests A in a different position.

Let's update what we now know after the four guesses.

Known letters in the word (✓) and their positions:
- N is in position 5 (last letter).

Known letters in the word but wrong positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from RANCH, NIGMA, FAKIN).
  So A must be in position 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from NIGMA, FAKIN).
  So I must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- K, F, G, M, S, L, T, H, C, E are all absent.

Letters still allowed: B, D, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters A, I, N.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- N fixed at position 5.
- A and I somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (with A restricted to 1 or 4).
- Two additional letters from the still-allowed set.

Let's list possible placements:

Case 1: A in position 1
Then I must be in 3 or 4.
Possible patterns:
A _ I _ N
A _ _ I N

Case 2: A in position 4
Then I must be in 1, 3.
Possible patterns:
I _ _ A N
_ I _ A N

Now we need to pick valid English words that fit these patterns using allowed letters.

Looking at Case 1:
A _ I _ N
Possible letters for 2 and 4: B, D, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
A B I D N → ""ABIDN"" – not a word
A B I O N → ""ABION"" – not a word
A D I V N → ""ADIVN"" – not a word

Case 2:
_ I _ A N
Possible: B, D, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
D I V A N → ""DIVAN"" – valid word (a type of couch or the word ""divan"" as in ""divan bed"")

This fits all constraints:
- N is at 5 (✓)
- A is at 4 (allowed)
- I is at 2 (allowed)
- D and V are new letters from the still-allowed set.

So ""DIVAN"" is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (x) – not in the word at all
- A (-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (x) – not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A, but A is not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the third position.
2. Does not use S, L, T, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

A good next guess could be “RANCH”:
- R – common consonant
- A – known to be in the word, now in position 2
- N – common consonant
- C – common consonant
- H – common consonant

This tests five new letters (R, N, C, H) plus re-tests A in a different position.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RANCH → R(x) A(-) N(-) C(x) H(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, C, H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, C, H
- Letters known to be in the word: A, N
- A is not in position 2 or 3.
- N is not in position 3.

We need a word that:
- Contains A and N.
- A is in position 1, 4, or 5.
- N is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only letters that haven't been eliminated.

Looking at remaining common letters: D, G, B, M, P, O, I, U, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- BANDA (but A is repeated and we don't know if A is repeated)
- MANIA (contains A and N, tests new letters M, I)
- PANDA (but D is untested)
- GANJA (but J is less common)
- MANIA seems good as it tests M and I while keeping A and N.

Let's check MANIA:
- M – new letter
- A – known to be in word, now in position 2 (but we know A is not in 2 from RANCH feedback). Oops, A is in position 2 in MANIA which we already know is wrong. Need to adjust.

Better candidate: PANIC
- P – new
- A – known, now in position 1 (acceptable, since 1 is allowed for A)
- N – known, now in position 2 (acceptable, since 3 is not allowed for N but 2 is fine)
- I – new
- C – already eliminated (from RANCH feedback), so C is out. PANIC is invalid.

Next: ANGEL – but E and L are eliminated.

Next: AUDIO – but O and U are new, but D is new as well, but this has U and O which are vowels but we need to test consonants.

Better: GONNA – but double N might not be useful.

Let's think systematically:
We need a word with A and N, A not in 2 or 3, N not in 3.

Possible positions:
A: 1, 4, or 5
N: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

Let's try A in 1, N in 2: AN _ _ _
Possible: ANKLE – but K, L, E have issues (L and E eliminated)
ANKLE: L and E are eliminated, so invalid.

A in 1, N in 4: _ _ _ N A
Possible: DUNNA – but D, U are new, but N is repeated
MUNNA – similar issue

A in 1, N in 5: _ _ _ _ A
Possible: BUNNY – but Y is new, but N is repeated and we don't know if N is repeated
DUNNY – same issue

A in 4, N in 1: N _ _ A _
Possible: NURGA – but G is new, U is new
NIGMA – but M is new, I is new

A in 4, N in 2: _ N _ A _
Possible: BONNA – but B, O are new, N is repeated
DINER – but I, D, R (R eliminated)
MINER – R eliminated

A in 5, N in 1: N _ _ _ A
Possible: NIGMA – M, I, G are new
NODIA – D, I, O are new

Let's pick NIGMA:
- N – known, position 1 (acceptable)
- I – new
- G – new
- M – new
- A – known, position 5 (acceptable)

This tests three new letters (I, G, M) while placing A in position 5 and N in position 1.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have tested so far:
S, L, T, E, R, C, H, G, M

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
S, L, T, E, R, C, H, G, M

Letters that ARE in the word (✓), but whose exact positions are still unknown:
A, N, I

So the secret word contains the letters A, N, I exactly once each (we have no evidence of duplicates yet), and none of the eliminated letters.

Position constraints we have gathered:
- A is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from RANCH and NIGMA feedback).
- N is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from RANCH and NIGMA feedback).
- I is NOT in position 2 (from NIGMA feedback).

Remaining alphabet letters that are still allowed:
B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the known letters A, N, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses each of A, N, I exactly once.
2. Uses two additional letters from the still-allowed set.
3. Places A only in positions 1, 4, or 5.
4. Places N only in positions 2 or 4 or 5.
5. Places I only in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps A, N, I in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
- Adds two fresh, common consonants from the still-allowed set.

A good candidate is “FAINT”:
- F and T are both still allowed (T was only eliminated in earlier guesses, but T itself was marked ✗ in SLATE, so T is out). Oops, T is eliminated.

Next candidate: “FIANA” – but A repeats, and we don’t know if A is repeated.

Better: “JINNY” – but Y is allowed, N repeats, and we don’t know about duplicates.

Let’s try “PAINT”:
- P is allowed.
- A in position 2 is NOT allowed (A cannot be in 2). Reject.

Try “FAKIN”:
- F, K allowed.
- A in 1, K in 2, I in 3, N in 4 – positions satisfy constraints.

“FAKIN” is a valid English word (means “to fake” or “to deceive”) and meets all constraints.

Therefore, we’ll guess FAKIN.

Known letters in the word (✓) and their positions:
- N is in position 5 (last letter).

Known letters in the word but wrong positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from RANCH, NIGMA, FAKIN).
  So A must be in position 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from NIGMA, FAKIN).
  So I must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- K, F, G, M, S, L, T, H, C, E are all absent.

Letters still allowed: B, D, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters A, I, N.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- N fixed at position 5.
- A and I somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (with A restricted to 1 or 4).
- Two additional letters from the still-allowed set.

Let's list possible placements:

Case 1: A in position 1
Then I must be in 3 or 4.
Possible patterns:
A _ I _ N
A _ _ I N

Case 2: A in position 4
Then I must be in 1, 3.
Possible patterns:
I _ _ A N
_ I _ A N

Now we need to pick valid English words that fit these patterns using allowed letters.

Looking at Case 1:
A _ I _ N
Possible letters for 2 and 4: B, D, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
A B I D N → ""ABIDN"" – not a word
A B I O N → ""ABION"" – not a word
A D I V N → ""ADIVN"" – not a word

Case 2:
_ I _ A N
Possible: B, D, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
D I V A N → ""DIVAN"" – valid word (a type of couch or the word ""divan"" as in ""divan bed"")

This fits all constraints:
- N is at 5 (✓)
- A is at 4 (allowed)
- I is at 2 (allowed)
- D and V are new letters from the still-allowed set.

So ""DIVAN"" is a strong next guess.

Let's gather everything we now know after five guesses.

1. N is fixed in position 5 (✓ from Guess 4 and 5).
2. Letters definitely absent (✗): S, L, T, E, R, C, H, G, M, F, D, V.
3. Letters that are present but whose positions are still unknown:
   - A (must be in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 – from RANCH, NIGMA, FAKIN, DIVAN).  
     The only remaining spot for A is position 1.
   - I (must be in the word, but not in positions 2, 5, or now 4 – from NIGMA, FAKIN, DIVAN).  
     So I can only be in position 3.
4. Therefore the word must look like: A _ I _ N.
5. The two blank spots must be filled with letters that have not yet been ruled out.  
   Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, J, K, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
   From earlier guesses, K was already tested (in FAKIN) and marked ✗, so K is out.  
   The remaining valid letters are B, J, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form A _ I _ N using any of those remaining letters in the second and fourth positions.

Possible combinations:
- A B I O N → ""ABION"" – not a word
- A B I P N → ""ABIPN"" – not a word
- A J I O N → ""AJION"" – not a word
- A P I O N → ""APION"" – not a word
- A P I U N → ""APIUN"" – not a word
- A U I O N → ""AUION"" – not a word
- A U I P N → ""AUIPN"" – not a word
- A Y I O N → ""AYION"" – not a word

The only valid English word that matches the pattern A _ I _ N with the remaining allowed letters is ""AUDIO"".

Check constraints:
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- U and O are new letters not yet eliminated
- D and V were already eliminated, but O and U are still allowed
- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is the next logical guess.
