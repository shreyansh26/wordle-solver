### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.  

A strong second guess that uses these letters is “ROUND”:

Current constraints:

_ O _ _ _

N must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Good remaining consonants to test: C, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere else.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

- ""HONEY"" - but E is ruled out.
- ""PONGY"" - not a valid word.
- ""CONCH"" - but C and H are allowed, and it has O in position 2 and N in position 3.

""CONCH"" is valid and fits the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.  
To maximize information gain, I should pick a word with letters that are still possible and cover common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.  

A strong second guess that uses these letters is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D — none of these were ruled out yet.  
- It tests two new vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (R, N, D).  
This will help narrow down the remaining possibilities efficiently.

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D
- Letters known to be in the word: O (correct position 2), N (in the word but not in position 4)

So far we have:
_ O _ _ _

N must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Good remaining consonants to test: C, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (but U is already ruled out), so only I is left.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere else.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates: CONIN (invalid), PONNY (invalid), HONNY (invalid), but we can use:
- H O N N Y (but Y is allowed)
- M O N K Y (but K is less common)
- P O N G Y (but G is allowed)

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- ""MONKS"" - but S is ruled out.
- ""HONEY"" - but E is ruled out.
- ""PONGY"" - not a valid word.
- ""CONCH"" - but C and H are allowed, and it has O in position 2 and N in position 3.

""CONCH"" seems valid:
C, O, N, C, H - all letters are still possible, and it satisfies O in position 2 and N in position 3.

But let me check if there's a better word. Another option is ""HONKY"" but K is less common. ""MONKY"" is also not a valid word. ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters. 

""CONCH"" is valid and fits the constraints.

However, let me think of a word with N in position 5: ""CHONY"" - but is CHONY a valid word? It's obscure.

Better option: ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters. 

Another valid word: ""HONKY"" - but K is allowed.

But ""HONKY"" is more common. Let's go with ""HONKY"":
H, O, N, K, Y - all letters are still possible, O is in position 2, N is in position 3 (so not in position 4, satisfying the feedback).

But wait, in ""HONKY"", N is in position 3, which is allowed since N must be in a position other than 4. This seems correct.

Alternatively, ""MONKY"" is invalid. ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters. 

""HONKY"" seems the best option here.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(x)

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D
- Letters known to be in the word: O (correct position 2), N (in the word but not in position 4)

So far we have:
_ O _ _ _

N must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Good remaining consonants to test: C, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (but U is already ruled out), so only I is left.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere else.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates: CONIN (invalid), PONNY (invalid), HONNY (invalid), but we can use:
- H O N N Y (but Y is allowed)
- M O N K Y (but K is less common)
- P O N G Y (but G is allowed)

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- ""MONKS"" - but S is ruled out.
- ""HONEY"" - but E is ruled out.
- ""PONGY"" - not a valid word.
- ""CONCH"" - but C and H are allowed, and it has O in position 2 and N in position 3.

""CONCH"" seems valid:
C, O, N, C, H - all letters are still possible, and it satisfies O in position 2 and N in position 3.

But let me check if there's a better word. Another option is ""HONKY"" but K is less common. ""MONKY"" is also not a valid word. ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters. 

""CONCH"" is valid and fits the constraints.

However, let me think of a word with N in position 5: ""CHONY"" - but is CHONY a valid word? It's obscure.

Better option: ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters. 

Another valid word: ""HONKY"" - but K is allowed.

But ""HONKY"" is more common. Let's go with ""HONKY"":
H, O, N, K, Y - all letters are still possible, O is in position 2, N is in position 3 (so not in position 4, satisfying the feedback).

But wait, in ""HONKY"", N is in position 3, which is allowed since N must be in a position other than 4. This seems correct.

Alternatively, ""MONKY"" is invalid. ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters. 

""HONKY"" seems the best option here.

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, H, K, Y
- Letters known to be in the word: O (position 2), N (position 3)

So the word structure is: _ O N _ _

Remaining possible consonants: C, G, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining possible vowels: I (since A, E, U, Y are ruled out)

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ O N _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- CONIC (but C is allowed, I is allowed)
- PONI (invalid, too short)
- MONIC (but M is allowed, I is allowed)
- WONKY (but K and Y are ruled out)
- PONCH (but H is ruled out)

Looking at valid words:
- CONIC: C O N I C - valid, uses C and I which are allowed
- MONIC: M O N I C - valid, uses M and I which are allowed
- PONI_ : no valid 5-letter words

Between CONIC and MONIC, both are valid, but CONIC is more common.

Let's go with CONIC.

But wait, let me check if all letters are allowed:
C, O, N, I, C - all are allowed based on current constraints.

Yes, this seems correct.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, H, K, Y  
2. Letters known to be in the word and their positions:  
   - O must be in position 2  
   - N must be in position 3  
   - I must be in position 4  
   - C must be in position 5 (because only the last C got a ✓, meaning it’s in the right place)

The structure is therefore: _ O N I C

The first letter is the only unknown.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): any letter not in the banned list and not already used in their current positions.  
Remaining consonants: B, F, G, M, P, V, W, etc.

Valid 5-letter words that fit _ O N I C:
- BONIC  
- FONIC (not a common word)  
- GONIC (not standard)  
- MONIC  
- PONIC (not standard)  
- WONIC (not standard)

Among these, MONIC is a recognized word (relating to a monic polynomial) and uses M, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.

So the next logical guess is MONIC.
