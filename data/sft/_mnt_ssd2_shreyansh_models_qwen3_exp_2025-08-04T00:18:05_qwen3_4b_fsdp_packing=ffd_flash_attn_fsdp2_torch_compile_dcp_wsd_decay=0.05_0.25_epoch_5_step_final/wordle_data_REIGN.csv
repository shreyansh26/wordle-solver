### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
S, L, A, T, C, O, U, D, R, N, E

Letters NOT in the word:
S, L, A, T, C, O, U, D

Letters that ARE in the word (with their known restrictions):
- R: must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 5 from earlier? Wait: UNDER gave R(-) so R is in the word but NOT in position 5. So R can be 1, 3, or 4.)
- N: must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4 from CRONE and cannot be 2 from UNDER? No, UNDER had N(-) meaning N is in word but NOT in position 2. So N can be 1, 3, 4, or 5.)
- E: must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5)

We still need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, N, E at least once each.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the known letters R, N, E.
3. Respects the positional restrictions above.

Let’s list possible positions for R, N, E:

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need to place R, N, E plus two additional letters (from B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y) such that all constraints are met.

Let’s try to find a word that fits. One systematic way is to look for common words that contain R, N, E and use remaining letters.

Consider “BEGIN”:
- Letters: B, E, G, I, N
- Contains E and N but not R – invalid.

Consider “PERIN”:
- Letters: P, E, R, I, N
- Contains P, E, R, I, N – all allowed.
- Check constraints:
  – R is in position 3 (allowed: 1,3,4)
  – N is in position 5 (allowed: 1,3,4,5)
  – E is in position 2 (allowed: 1,2,3,4)
  – No forbidden letters (S,L,A,T,C,O,U,D are absent)
  – All letters are unique, so no duplicates to worry about.

This seems to satisfy every constraint.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So we now know:
- The word contains E (but not at the end).
- The letters S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain S, L, A, T.
2. Does contain E, but not as the last letter.

Looking at common letters we haven’t ruled out yet: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good second guess should introduce several new common letters while respecting the constraints.  
""CRONE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It introduces C, R, O, N (all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out).
- It places E in the 4th position, satisfying the ""E is in the word but not last"" clue.

Let’s try CRONE.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on CRONE:

- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed earlier).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, N, E.
- Positions ruled out for these letters:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – N cannot be in position 4.
  – E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, N, E (at least once each).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, O.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
5. Places N somewhere other than position 4.

Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, M, P, Y, K, B, F, V, W, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already known to be in).

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies all constraints.  
A promising pattern is “_ _ _ E _” to place E in position 4 (which is still allowed).  
We still need to place R and N somewhere.

Consider “UNDER”:
- Letters: U, N, D, E, R.
- Contains U, N, D, E, R – all allowed letters.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since only position 2 was ruled out).
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since only position 4 was ruled out).

This looks valid.

Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:
- E is fixed in position 2
- N is fixed in position 5

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 because 2 has E, 3 is excluded by PERIN, and 5 has N)
- I (cannot be in position 4)

Remaining letters we can still use: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus R and I.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with:
- One of them will be R (positions allowed: 1 or 4, but 4 is excluded for I, so R must be in 1 or 4, but I cannot be in 4, so R must be in 1 or 4, but position 4 could still take R)
- One of them will be I (cannot be in 4, so positions allowed: 1, 3)
- One of them will be from the remaining letters (B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y)

Also, we have to ensure that R and I are both placed correctly.

Let’s consider possible arrangements:

We have _ E _ _ N with positions 1,3,4 to fill.

Possible placements:
- R could be in position 1 or 4
- I could be in position 1 or 3
- The third letter will be from the remaining pool.

Let’s try R in position 1:
R E _ _ N
Now we need to place I in position 3 (since position 4 is open but I cannot be in 4)
R E I _ N
The last letter (position 4) must be from B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
Looking for common words: R E I _ N
REIGN – but G is allowed and not yet excluded. REIGN is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- G is allowed (not in excluded list)
- E is in position 2 (correct)
- N is in position 5 (correct)
- No forbidden letters are used.

This seems valid.

- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 3.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
