### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters in 5-letter English words include S, T, A, R, N, L, etc. Similarly, common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess should ideally include:

1. A common consonant (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. A couple of common vowels (like A, E, I)
3. No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and provides good initial information about multiple possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:

- L, A, E are not in their original positions (positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep L, A, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (like R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S and T.

Possible candidates:
- RELAX (R, E, L, A, X) – keeps E in position 2, L in position 3, A in position 4, introduces R and X.
- ALONE (A, L, O, N, E) – keeps A in position 1, L in position 2, E in position 5, introduces O and N.
- LEARN (L, E, A, R, N) – keeps L in position 1, E in position 2, A in position 3, introduces R and N.

From the new feedback on RELAX:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 4
- X is NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _ (positions 2 and 4 locked)
- Must contain R and L somewhere (but not in their current positions: R not at 1, L not at 3)
- Cannot contain S, T, or X

Possible positions for R and L:
- R can be at 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is A, so R can be at 3 or 5.
- L can be at 1, 2, 3, or 5. Position 2 is E, so L can be at 1, 3, or 5.

But we need to place both R and L without conflicts. Let’s list possible words fitting _ E _ A _ with R and L:

1. If R is at 3: _ E R A _, then L must be at 1 or 5 → L E R A _ or _ E R A L
   - L E R A _ → L E R A ? (needs a 5th letter, but we already have E, R, A, L – no new letters needed if it’s a 5-letter word, but this would repeat letters: L E R A L – but that’s 4 unique letters, and we know the word has 5 unique letters? Actually, the rules don’t say letters must be unique, but Wordle words typically have unique letters. However, we can’t assume that. But L E R A L is a valid word but repeats L, which might not be the case.

2. If R is at 5: _ E _ A R, then L must be at 1 or 3 → L E _ A R or _ E L A R
   - L E _ A R: needs a 3rd letter. Possible: L E N A R (but is that a word?), L E G A R (LEGAL is a word, but that would be L E G A L, which fits _ E G A L – but we have R at 5, so L E G A R – is that a word? LEGAR isn’t valid, but LEGAL is 5 letters and fits _ E G A L – but we have R at 5, so this doesn’t fit.

3. If L is at 1: L E R A _ or L E _ A R
   - L E R A _: needs 5th letter, but we have L, E, R, A – could be L E R A Y (but Y is untested)
   - L E _ A R: needs 3rd letter, could be L E G A R (not valid), L E N A R (not valid)

4. If L is at 3: _ E L A _, then R must be at 5 → _ E L A R
   - Possible: B E L A R (not valid), C E L A R (not valid), F E L A R (not valid), G E L A R (not valid), H E L A R (not valid), J E L A R (not valid), K E L A R (not valid), M E L A R (not valid), N E L A R (not valid), P E L A R (not valid), Q E L A R (not valid), V E L A R (not valid), W E L A R (not valid), X E L A R (X already excluded), Y E L A R (not valid), Z E L A R (not valid).

This path isn’t yielding obvious words. Let me try a different approach: list common 5-letter words with pattern _ E _ A _ and check for R and L.

Some candidates:
- BERGA (but G and B are untested, and we know R must be present)
- PERAL (P, E, R, A, L) – this has P, E, R, A, L – all required letters (E and A already confirmed, R and L confirmed in word)
- PERAL fits the pattern: P at 1, E at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5
- Check positions: R was at 1 in RELAX (wrong position), here R is at 3 – acceptable
- L was at 3 in RELAX (wrong position), here L is at 5 – acceptable
- No S, T, or X
- PERAL is a valid word

Another candidate: MERAL (but not common)
Another: FERAL (F, E, R, A, L) – also valid
Between PERAL and FERAL, both are valid, but FERAL is more common.

But let me verify FERAL:
- F E R A L
- E at 2 ✓
- A at 4 ✓
- R at 3 (was at 1 before) ✓
- L at 5 (was at 3 before) ✓
- No S, T, X ✓
