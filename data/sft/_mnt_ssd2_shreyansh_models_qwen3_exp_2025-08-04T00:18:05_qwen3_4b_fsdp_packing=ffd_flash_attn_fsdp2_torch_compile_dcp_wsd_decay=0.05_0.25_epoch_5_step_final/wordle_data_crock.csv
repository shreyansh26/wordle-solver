For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It has no repeated letters, giving maximum information

This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern we have is: _ R O _ _

Next, I want to test new letters while keeping R and O fixed. The remaining positions (1st and 4th) are unknown, and the 5th is also unknown. 

Good letters to test next are common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, H, etc., and vowels I, U (since A and E are ruled out). 

A strong candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: confirmed correct (2nd position)
- O: confirmed correct (3rd position)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests three new letters (F, N, T) while keeping R and O fixed. If this doesn't work, we can narrow down the possibilities further.

- Still-available common consonants: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
- Still-available vowels: I, U (A and E are out, O is already in place)

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern we have is: _ R O _ _

Next, I want to test new letters while keeping R and O fixed. The remaining positions (1st and 4th) are unknown, and the 5th is also unknown. 

Good letters to test next are common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, H, etc., and vowels I, U (since A and E are ruled out). 

A strong candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: confirmed correct (2nd position)
- O: confirmed correct (3rd position)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests three new letters (F, N, T) while keeping R and O fixed. If this doesn't work, we can narrow down the possibilities further.

We now know:
- Letters fixed: R (2nd) and O (3rd) → pattern _ R O _ _
- Eliminated letters so far: A, S, E, F, N, T
- Still-available common consonants: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
- Still-available vowels: I, U (A and E are out, O is already in place)

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4, and possibly a vowel for position 5.  
A good word that fits the pattern and tests useful letters is “CROAK”:
- C: new consonant for position 1  
- R: confirmed in position 2  
- O: confirmed in position 3  
- A: already eliminated (but this shows we don’t need it)  
- K: new consonant for position 5  

However, since A is eliminated, let’s pick a word that avoids all known bad letters and keeps the pattern:  
“CROOK” would reuse O, but we already know O is correct in position 3.  
A better choice is “CROON” (but N is eliminated).  
Next best: “CROWD”:
- C: new letter 1  
- R: correct 2  
- O: correct 3  
- W: new letter 4  
- D: new letter 5  

This tests three fresh letters (C, W, D) while respecting the fixed R and O.

We need two letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 4 and 5.  
Looking at common English combinations for ""cro"" + letter endings:

Possible endings:
- ""cro"" + B → ""croxb""? No, that’s not 5 letters.
- ""cro"" + G → ""croog""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + H → ""croph""? Not a word.
- ""cro"" + L → ""crol""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + M → ""crom""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + V → ""crov""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + Y → ""croy""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + I → ""croci""? Not valid.

However, ""cro"" + K is not possible since K was not tested but is eliminated here.  
Looking more carefully, the only common valid word that fits C R O _ _ and uses remaining letters is ""crock"" but C is already used in position 1.  
Next, ""croon"" uses N (eliminated).  
""cro"" + M + something? ""crom"" is not a word.  
""cro"" + K is invalid.  
Wait, ""cro"" + I + something? ""croci"" is plural of cROCus, but not a valid word.

But we have ""cro"" + remaining letters: B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I.  
Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with CRO:

- CROON (N eliminated)
- CROAK (A, K eliminated)
- CROWD (W, D eliminated)
- CROFT (F, T eliminated)
- CROOK (O is already in position 3, so duplicate O is allowed? But O is already fixed in position 3, so CROOK would be C R O O K, but O is already confirmed in position 3, so the second O is possible. However, K is not eliminated yet. But in our previous eliminations, K was not tested, so it's still possible.

But let's see if CROOK is a valid word - yes, it is.  
Let me check if any letters in CROOK are eliminated:
C, R, O are correct positions.
O is allowed to repeat? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters, so it's possible.  
K hasn't been eliminated yet.  

So CROOK is a possible word.

Another option is ""crock"" but C is already in position 1, and we don't know if C is allowed to repeat, but the feedback didn't indicate any issue with duplicates yet. However, CROOK seems more likely.

But let me think if there are better options.  
Another valid word is ""cruel"" but that starts with CR, not CRO.  

Looking back, the only valid words fitting CRO _ _ with remaining letters seem to be CROOK and CROON (but N is eliminated).  
CROOK uses O and K. O is allowed to repeat, and K is not eliminated.  

So the best next guess is CROOK.

But wait, let me double-check:
Letters eliminated so far: A, S, E, F, N, T, W, D, U, P
Available letters: B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I, K (since K wasn't eliminated)
CROOK uses C, R, O, O, K - all allowed based on current feedback.

- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern we have is: _ R O _ _

Next, I want to test new letters while keeping R and O fixed. The remaining positions (1st and 4th) are unknown, and the 5th is also unknown. 

Good letters to test next are common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, H, etc., and vowels I, U (since A and E are ruled out). 

A strong candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: confirmed correct (2nd position)
- O: confirmed correct (3rd position)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests three new letters (F, N, T) while keeping R and O fixed. If this doesn't work, we can narrow down the possibilities further.

We now know:
- Letters fixed: R (2nd) and O (3rd) → pattern _ R O _ _
- Eliminated letters so far: A, S, E, F, N, T
- Still-available common consonants: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
- Still-available vowels: I, U (A and E are out, O is already in place)

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4, and possibly a vowel for position 5.  
A good word that fits the pattern and tests useful letters is “CROAK”:
- C: new consonant for position 1  
- R: confirmed in position 2  
- O: confirmed in position 3  
- A: already eliminated (but this shows we don’t need it)  
- K: new consonant for position 5  

However, since A is eliminated, let’s pick a word that avoids all known bad letters and keeps the pattern:  
“CROOK” would reuse O, but we already know O is correct in position 3.  
A better choice is “CROON” (but N is eliminated).  
Next best: “CROWD”:
- C: new letter 1  
- R: correct 2  
- O: correct 3  
- W: new letter 4  
- D: new letter 5  

This tests three fresh letters (C, W, D) while respecting the fixed R and O.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: C is correct → pattern C R O _ _
- Position 2: R is correct → already known
- Position 3: O is correct → already known
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, F, N, T, W, D

Remaining possible letters (excluding the already-placed C, R, O):
Consonants: B, G, H, L, M, P, V, Y
Vowels: I, U

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Common endings for ""cro"" + letter combinations:
- ""croup"" (but P is still possible)
- ""crown"" (but W and N are eliminated)
- ""crock"" (but C is already used in position 1)
- ""croup"" uses P and U, both still possible.

Let's test ""croup"":

We now know:
- The word starts exactly with C R O _ _
- Eliminated letters for positions 4 and 5: U, P, W, D, N, T, S, E, A, F
- Still available letters (excluding C, R, O): B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I

We need two letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 4 and 5.  
Looking at common English combinations for ""cro"" + letter endings:

Possible endings:
- ""cro"" + B → ""croxb""? No, that’s not 5 letters.
- ""cro"" + G → ""croog""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + H → ""croph""? Not a word.
- ""cro"" + L → ""crol""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + M → ""crom""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + V → ""crov""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + Y → ""croy""? Not valid.
- ""cro"" + I → ""croci""? Not valid.

However, ""cro"" + K is not possible since K was not tested but is eliminated here.  
Looking more carefully, the only common valid word that fits C R O _ _ and uses remaining letters is ""crock"" but C is already used in position 1.  
Next, ""croon"" uses N (eliminated).  
""cro"" + M + something? ""crom"" is not a word.  
""cro"" + K is invalid.  
Wait, ""cro"" + I + something? ""croci"" is plural of cROCus, but not a valid word.

But we have ""cro"" + remaining letters: B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I.  
Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with CRO:

- CROON (N eliminated)
- CROAK (A, K eliminated)
- CROWD (W, D eliminated)
- CROFT (F, T eliminated)
- CROOK (O is already in position 3, so duplicate O is allowed? But O is already fixed in position 3, so CROOK would be C R O O K, but O is already confirmed in position 3, so the second O is possible. However, K is not eliminated yet. But in our previous eliminations, K was not tested, so it's still possible.

But let's see if CROOK is a valid word - yes, it is.  
Let me check if any letters in CROOK are eliminated:
C, R, O are correct positions.
O is allowed to repeat? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters, so it's possible.  
K hasn't been eliminated yet.  

So CROOK is a possible word.

Another option is ""crock"" but C is already in position 1, and we don't know if C is allowed to repeat, but the feedback didn't indicate any issue with duplicates yet. However, CROOK seems more likely.

But let me think if there are better options.  
Another valid word is ""cruel"" but that starts with CR, not CRO.  

Looking back, the only valid words fitting CRO _ _ with remaining letters seem to be CROOK and CROON (but N is eliminated).  
CROOK uses O and K. O is allowed to repeat, and K is not eliminated.  

So the best next guess is CROOK.

But wait, let me double-check:
Letters eliminated so far: A, S, E, F, N, T, W, D, U, P
Available letters: B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I, K (since K wasn't eliminated)
CROOK uses C, R, O, O, K - all allowed based on current feedback.

Yes, CROOK is the most plausible next guess.

Now we have:

- Eliminated letters for position 4: U, P, W, D, N, T, S, E, A, F
- Still available letters (excluding C, R, O, K): B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I

We need one letter for position 4 that is still allowed and makes a valid 5-letter word.  
Looking at the remaining letters and checking valid words that fit C R O _ K:

- CROIK – not a word
- CROBK – not a word
- CROHK – not a word
- CROLK – not a word
- CROMK – not a word
- CROVK – not a word
- CRO YK – not a word
- CRO I K – not a word

But ""CROOK"" already used K in position 5, and we need a single letter in position 4.  
Looking at the list again, the only common English word that fits C R O _ K is ""CROCK"", but C is already in position 1 and we don't know if C repeats. However, ""CROCK"" is a valid word and C is already confirmed in position 1, so it's possible.

But let's think of other possibilities. The letter must be from B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I.

Looking at valid words:
- CROCK – valid, C is allowed to repeat
- CROIK – invalid
- CROHK – invalid
- CROVK – invalid
- CROMK – invalid
- CROBLK – invalid

The only valid word seems to be CROCK. But let me check if C is allowed to repeat. The feedback didn't say anything against it, so it's possible.

However, looking back at the feedback, when we guessed ""arose"", R was correct in position 2, and O was correct in position 3. This implies that R and O are in their exact positions, but doesn't necessarily prevent C from repeating. 

But actually, ""CROCK"" would be C R O C K, which has C in positions 1 and 4. This seems possible.

But let me think if there are other valid words. The letter must be from B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I. 

Looking at possible combinations:
- CROBK – invalid
- CROHK – invalid
- CROIK – invalid
- CROLK – invalid
- CROMK – invalid
- CROVK – invalid

The only valid word seems to be CROCK. 

But let me double-check: is CROCK a valid word? Yes, it is. So the word must be CROCK.

But wait, let me check if any other letters work:
- CROIK – invalid
- CROHK – invalid
- CROLK – invalid
- CROMK – invalid
- CROVK – invalid

No, CROCK seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern C R O _ K with available letters.

But let me check if I missed any letters. The available letters are B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I. None of these form a valid word with CRO _ K except CROCK (but C is already used in position 1).

This suggests that the word must be CROCK, even with C repeating.

But looking back, when we guessed ""arose"", A was x, R was ✓, O was ✓, S was x, E was x. This implies that R and O are in their correct positions, but doesn't prevent C from appearing again. 

Therefore, the word is CROCK.

But wait, let me think again. The feedback for ""crook"" was C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) K(✓). The ""-"" on the second O means that O is in the word but not in position 4. But position 4 is the only unknown, and the feedback says O is in the word but not in position 4. This implies that O is not in position 4, but we already have O in position 3, so this feedback is consistent. 

But this doesn't give us new information about position 4. 

Given that, the only valid word seems to be CROCK. 

But let me check if there are other possibilities. The letter in position 4 must be from B, G, H, L, M, V, Y, I. 

Looking at these letters:
- B: CROBK – invalid
- G: CRO GK – invalid
- H: CROHK – invalid
- L: CROLK – invalid
- M: CROMK – invalid
- V: CROVK – invalid
- Y: CRO YK – invalid
- I: CROIK – invalid

None of these form valid words. This suggests that CROCK is indeed the only possible word, despite C repeating. 

But looking back, the feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters, so it's possible. 

Therefore, the word must be CROCK.

But wait, let me double-check if CROCK is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""crock"" is a valid word meaning a small clay vessel or a place where birds roost.

Thus, the next guess is CROCK.
