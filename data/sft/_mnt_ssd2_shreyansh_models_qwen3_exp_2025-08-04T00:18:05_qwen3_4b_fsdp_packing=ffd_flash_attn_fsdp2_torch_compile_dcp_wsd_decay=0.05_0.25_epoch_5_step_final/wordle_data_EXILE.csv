For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities.

A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters and that covers a range of vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning for common letters

This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)

So we know:
- Word ends with E
- No A, R, O, S appear anywhere else

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the final spot
2. Introduce new, common letters not yet tested (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, O, S

A word that satisfies these and uses common letters is “TUNNE” but “TUNNE” isn’t a standard English word. “UNTIE” is valid but uses I and T. “LITHE” uses L, I, T, H, E. Among these, “UNTIE” is common and uses U, N, T, I, E with E fixed at the end. However, U is less common than T or N. 

Another candidate: “CLEAN” but it ends with N, not E. “ELITE” uses E twice (bad). “EXCEL” ends with L. 

Best candidate: “UNTIE” keeps E in place and introduces U, N, T, I. But U is less common. 

Alternative: “INLET” – ends with T, not E. 

Let’s pick a word that ends with E and uses common consonants not yet eliminated: “UNTIE” is acceptable, but “UNTIE” is 5 letters: U N T I E. All letters are new except E. 

Another good option: “TIGER” but R is eliminated. 

“WHITE” – H is new, T is new, I is new, E is fixed. Uses W, H, I, T, E. All new letters except E. 

Between “UNTIE” and “WHITE”, “WHITE” introduces more common letters (W, H, I, T) and is a valid word.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is somewhere in the word (but not in position 3, since that’s where it was in WHITE and the feedback was I(✓) meaning it is in the correct spot, so I must be in position 3).
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, W, H, T.

So far the pattern is:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: E

We need two new consonants and one new vowel that haven’t been eliminated. Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, plus vowels U and Y (Y can act as a vowel).

A good candidate word would fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:
- BLINE
- CLINE
- DLINE
- FLINE
- GLINE
- MINCE
- PLINE
- BRINE
- CRANE (but A is out)
- DINGE
- FLING (but G is new, but word ends with E? FLING ends with G)
- BLIME (but M is new, B is new)

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in E with I in the third position: BLIME, CLIME, FLIME, PLIME, BRINE, CRINE, DRINE, PRINE, etc.

Among these, “BRINE” uses B, R, I, N, E. R was already ruled out in AROSE (R(x)), so BRINE is invalid.

“CLIME” uses C, L, I, M, E – all letters are new (C, L, M not yet tested). C and L are common, M is moderate frequency.

“DLIME” is not a valid English word.

“PLIME” is not a valid English word.

“BLIME” is not a valid English word.

“CRINE” is a valid word (relating to the skin), but R is already eliminated.

“PRINE” is valid (a pruned tree), but R is eliminated.

“MINCE” uses M, I, N, C, E – all new letters except I and E (which we know are in the word). M, I, N, C haven’t been ruled out yet.

“MINCE” fits the pattern _ _ I _ E (M I N C E), but wait: I is in position 2 here, but we know I must be in position 3. So MINCE doesn’t fit.

Let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ I _ E (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and E). So words like:
- B I _ _ E – but I is in position 2, not 3.
- _ I _ _ E – this is the correct pattern (positions 2 and 3: _ I _ _ E is not right, positions are 1-2-3-4-5, so the pattern is _ _ I _ E.

Valid English words with _ _ I _ E:
- BLIME (invalid)
- CLIME
- FLIME (invalid)
- PLIME (invalid)
- BRINE (invalid, R out)
- CRINE (invalid, R out)
- DRINE (invalid, R out)
- PRINE (invalid, R out)
- BLADE (but A is out)
- CLIDE (but D is new, C, L, I, D, E – but is CLIDE a word? No)
- FLITE (but T is out)
- GLIDE (but D is new, G, L, I, D, E – but is GLIDE a word? Yes, but D is new, G is new)

Actually, “GLIDE” is a valid word: G L I D E. All letters are new except I and E, and it fits _ _ I _ E pattern (positions 3: I, 5: E).

Similarly, “CLIDE” is not a word, but “CLIMB” is not ending with E.

Another valid word: “FLITE” – but T is out.

“PLUME” – but U is new, P, L, U, M, E – but I must be in position 3, so _ _ I _ E.

Let me think systematically: the pattern is _ _ I _ E. Valid English words:
- AGILE – A is out
- AMBLE – A is out
- ANGEL – A is out
- AROSE – A, R, O, S are out
- AWEIE – not a word
- BAGIE – not a word
- BALIE – not a word
- BAMIE – not a word
- CANOE – A, O are out
- CELLO – O is out
- CHIME – C, H, M are new, but H is out (from WHITE: H(x))
- CHIME: C, H, I, M, E. H is out, so invalid.
- DIME – too short
- ELITE – E is fixed at 5, I at 3: E L I T E – but T is out
- ENIME – not a word
- FABLE – A, B, L are new, but A is out
- FABLE: A is out
- FENCE – A, N, C are new, but A is out
- FENCE: A is out
- FIQUE – but F, I, Q, U, E – but Q is uncommon
- GLIDE – G, L, I, D, E. G, L, D are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- GRIME – G, R, I, M, E. R is out
- HIME – not a word
- JIGME – not a word
- KILOE – not a word
- LIGNE – not a word
- MIDGE – M, I, D, G, E. M, D, G are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- NIBLE – not a word
- OILED – A, O are out
- PILED – A is out
- PLIME – not a word
- PRINE – R is out
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. Q is uncommon, but U is new, N is new. Valid word.
- SABLE – A, S are out
- SCALE – A, S, C are out
- SCREE – S, C, R, E are out
- SHINE – S, H are out
- SKINE – S, K, I, N, E. S is out
- SPICE – S, P, I, C, E. S is out
- STONE – S, T are out
- SWINE – S, W are out
- THINE – T, H are out
- TIGER – T, R are out
- TONIE – T, O are out
- TRICE – T, R are out
- TRIKE – T, R are out
- VIGNE – not a word
- WIGLE – W, G, L are new, but W is out
- WIPED – W is out
- YODEL – not a word

From these, valid words fitting _ _ I _ E with new letters:
- GLIDE (G, L, D are new)
- MIDGE (M, D, G are new)
- QUINE (Q, U, N are new)

Among these, “GLIDE” uses G, L, I, D, E. All letters except I and E are new. G and L are common, D is moderate. This seems like the best next guess.

So the next guess is GLIDE.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5)
- I is in the correct position (position 3)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, W, H, T

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ I _ E using new letters. The valid candidate that fits is:

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in E with I in the third position: BLIME, CLIME, FLIME, PLIME, BRINE, CRINE, DRINE, PRINE, etc.

Among these, “BRINE” uses B, R, I, N, E. R was already ruled out in AROSE (R(x)), so BRINE is invalid.

“CLIME” uses C, L, I, M, E – all letters are new (C, L, M not yet tested). C and L are common, M is moderate frequency.

“DLIME” is not a valid English word.

“PLIME” is not a valid English word.

“BLIME” is not a valid English word.

“CRINE” is a valid word (relating to the skin), but R is already eliminated.

“PRINE” is valid (a pruned tree), but R is eliminated.

“MINCE” uses M, I, N, C, E – all new letters except I and E (which we know are in the word). M, I, N, C haven’t been ruled out yet.

“MINCE” fits the pattern _ _ I _ E (M I N C E), but wait: I is in position 2 here, but we know I must be in position 3. So MINCE doesn’t fit.

Let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ I _ E (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and E). So words like:
- B I _ _ E – but I is in position 2, not 3.
- _ I _ _ E – this is the correct pattern (positions 2 and 3: _ I _ _ E is not right, positions are 1-2-3-4-5, so the pattern is _ _ I _ E.

Valid English words with _ _ I _ E:
- BLIME (invalid)
- CLIME
- FLIME (invalid)
- PLIME (invalid)
- BRINE (invalid, R out)
- CRINE (invalid, R out)
- DRINE (invalid, R out)
- PRINE (invalid, R out)
- BLADE (but A is out)
- CLIDE (but D is new, C, L, I, D, E – but is CLIDE a word? No)
- FLITE (but T is out)
- GLIDE (but D is new, G, L, I, D, E – but is GLIDE a word? Yes, but D is new, G is new)

Actually, “GLIDE” is a valid word: G L I D E. All letters are new except I and E, and it fits _ _ I _ E pattern (positions 3: I, 5: E).

Similarly, “CLIDE” is not a word, but “CLIMB” is not ending with E.

Another valid word: “FLITE” – but T is out.

“PLUME” – but U is new, P, L, U, M, E – but I must be in position 3, so _ _ I _ E.

Let me think systematically: the pattern is _ _ I _ E. Valid English words:
- AGILE – A is out
- AMBLE – A is out
- ANGEL – A is out
- AROSE – A, R, O, S are out
- AWEIE – not a word
- BAGIE – not a word
- BALIE – not a word
- BAMIE – not a word
- CANOE – A, O are out
- CELLO – O is out
- CHIME – C, H, M are new, but H is out (from WHITE: H(x))
- CHIME: C, H, I, M, E. H is out, so invalid.
- DIME – too short
- ELITE – E is fixed at 5, I at 3: E L I T E – but T is out
- ENIME – not a word
- FABLE – A, B, L are new, but A is out
- FABLE: A is out
- FENCE – A, N, C are new, but A is out
- FENCE: A is out
- FIQUE – but F, I, Q, U, E – but Q is uncommon
- GLIDE – G, L, I, D, E. G, L, D are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- GRIME – G, R, I, M, E. R is out
- HIME – not a word
- JIGME – not a word
- KILOE – not a word
- LIGNE – not a word
- MIDGE – M, I, D, G, E. M, D, G are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- NIBLE – not a word
- OILED – A, O are out
- PILED – A is out
- PLIME – not a word
- PRINE – R is out
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. Q is uncommon, but U is new, N is new. Valid word.
- SABLE – A, S are out
- SCALE – A, S, C are out
- SCREE – S, C, R, E are out
- SHINE – S, H are out
- SKINE – S, K, I, N, E. S is out
- SPICE – S, P, I, C, E. S is out
- STONE – S, T are out
- SWINE – S, W are out
- THINE – T, H are out
- TIGER – T, R are out
- TONIE – T, O are out
- TRICE – T, R are out
- TRIKE – T, R are out
- VIGNE – not a word
- WIGLE – W, G, L are new, but W is out
- WIPED – W is out
- YODEL – not a word

From these, valid words fitting _ _ I _ E with new letters:
- GLIDE (G, L, D are new)
- MIDGE (M, D, G are new)
- QUINE (Q, U, N are new)

Among these, “GLIDE” uses G, L, I, D, E. All letters except I and E are new. G and L are common, D is moderate. This seems like the best next guess.

So the next guess is GLIDE.Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5)
- I is in the correct position (position 3)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, W, H, T

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ I _ E using new letters. The valid candidate that fits is:",Guess 3: glide -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) I(✓) D(x) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities.

A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters and that covers a range of vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning for common letters

This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)

So we know:
- Word ends with E
- No A, R, O, S appear anywhere else

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the final spot
2. Introduce new, common letters not yet tested (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, O, S

A word that satisfies these and uses common letters is “TUNNE” but “TUNNE” isn’t a standard English word. “UNTIE” is valid but uses I and T. “LITHE” uses L, I, T, H, E. Among these, “UNTIE” is common and uses U, N, T, I, E with E fixed at the end. However, U is less common than T or N. 

Another candidate: “CLEAN” but it ends with N, not E. “ELITE” uses E twice (bad). “EXCEL” ends with L. 

Best candidate: “UNTIE” keeps E in place and introduces U, N, T, I. But U is less common. 

Alternative: “INLET” – ends with T, not E. 

Let’s pick a word that ends with E and uses common consonants not yet eliminated: “UNTIE” is acceptable, but “UNTIE” is 5 letters: U N T I E. All letters are new except E. 

Another good option: “TIGER” but R is eliminated. 

“WHITE” – H is new, T is new, I is new, E is fixed. Uses W, H, I, T, E. All new letters except E. 

Between “UNTIE” and “WHITE”, “WHITE” introduces more common letters (W, H, I, T) and is a valid word. 

Let’s go with WHITE.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is somewhere in the word (but not in position 3, since that’s where it was in WHITE and the feedback was I(✓) meaning it is in the correct spot, so I must be in position 3).
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, W, H, T.

So far the pattern is:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: E

We need two new consonants and one new vowel that haven’t been eliminated. Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, plus vowels U and Y (Y can act as a vowel).

A good candidate word would fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:
- BLINE
- CLINE
- DLINE
- FLINE
- GLINE
- MINCE
- PLINE
- BRINE
- CRANE (but A is out)
- DINGE
- FLING (but G is new, but word ends with E? FLING ends with G)
- BLIME (but M is new, B is new)

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in E with I in the third position: BLIME, CLIME, FLIME, PLIME, BRINE, CRINE, DRINE, PRINE, etc.

Among these, “BRINE” uses B, R, I, N, E. R was already ruled out in AROSE (R(x)), so BRINE is invalid.

“CLIME” uses C, L, I, M, E – all letters are new (C, L, M not yet tested). C and L are common, M is moderate frequency.

“DLIME” is not a valid English word.

“PLIME” is not a valid English word.

“BLIME” is not a valid English word.

“CRINE” is a valid word (relating to the skin), but R is already eliminated.

“PRINE” is valid (a pruned tree), but R is eliminated.

“MINCE” uses M, I, N, C, E – all new letters except I and E (which we know are in the word). M, I, N, C haven’t been ruled out yet.

“MINCE” fits the pattern _ _ I _ E (M I N C E), but wait: I is in position 2 here, but we know I must be in position 3. So MINCE doesn’t fit.

Let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ I _ E (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and E). So words like:
- B I _ _ E – but I is in position 2, not 3.
- _ I _ _ E – this is the correct pattern (positions 2 and 3: _ I _ _ E is not right, positions are 1-2-3-4-5, so the pattern is _ _ I _ E.

Valid English words with _ _ I _ E:
- BLIME (invalid)
- CLIME
- FLIME (invalid)
- PLIME (invalid)
- BRINE (invalid, R out)
- CRINE (invalid, R out)
- DRINE (invalid, R out)
- PRINE (invalid, R out)
- BLADE (but A is out)
- CLIDE (but D is new, C, L, I, D, E – but is CLIDE a word? No)
- FLITE (but T is out)
- GLIDE (but D is new, G, L, I, D, E – but is GLIDE a word? Yes, but D is new, G is new)

Actually, “GLIDE” is a valid word: G L I D E. All letters are new except I and E, and it fits _ _ I _ E pattern (positions 3: I, 5: E).

Similarly, “CLIDE” is not a word, but “CLIMB” is not ending with E.

Another valid word: “FLITE” – but T is out.

“PLUME” – but U is new, P, L, U, M, E – but I must be in position 3, so _ _ I _ E.

Let me think systematically: the pattern is _ _ I _ E. Valid English words:
- AGILE – A is out
- AMBLE – A is out
- ANGEL – A is out
- AROSE – A, R, O, S are out
- AWEIE – not a word
- BAGIE – not a word
- BALIE – not a word

- CANOE – A, O are out
- CELLO – O is out
- CHIME – C, H, M are new, but H is out (from WHITE: H(x))
- CHIME: C, H, I, M, E. H is out, so invalid.
- DIME – too short
- ELITE – E is fixed at 5, I at 3: E L I T E – but T is out
- ENIME – not a word
- FABLE – A, B, L are new, but A is out
- FABLE: A is out
- FENCE – A, N, C are new, but A is out
- FENCE: A is out
- FIQUE – but F, I, Q, U, E – but Q is uncommon
- GLIDE – G, L, I, D, E. G, L, D are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- GRIME – G, R, I, M, E. R is out
- HIME – not a word
- JIGME – not a word
- KILOE – not a word
- LIGNE – not a word
- MIDGE – M, I, D, G, E. M, D, G are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- NIBLE – not a word
- OILED – A, O are out
- PILED – A is out
- PLIME – not a word
- PRINE – R is out
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. Q is uncommon, but U is new, N is new. Valid word.
- SABLE – A, S are out
- SCALE – A, S, C are out
- SCREE – S, C, R, E are out
- SHINE – S, H are out
- SKINE – S, K, I, N, E. S is out

- TONIE – T, O are out
- TRICE – T, R are out
- TRIKE – T, R are out
- VIGNE – not a word
- WIGLE – W, G, L are new, but W is out
- WIPED – W is out
- YODEL – not a word

From these, valid words fitting _ _ I _ E with new letters:
- GLIDE (G, L, D are new)
- MIDGE (M, D, G are new)
- QUINE (Q, U, N are new)

Among these, “GLIDE” uses G, L, I, D, E. All letters except I and E are new. G and L are common, D is moderate. This seems like the best next guess.

So the next guess is GLIDE.Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5)
- I is in the correct position (position 3)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, W, H, T

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ I _ E using new letters. The valid candidate that fits is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities.

A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters and that covers a range of vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning for common letters

This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)

So we know:
- Word ends with E
- No A, R, O, S appear anywhere else

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the final spot
2. Introduce new, common letters not yet tested (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, O, S

A word that satisfies these and uses common letters is “TUNNE” but “TUNNE” isn’t a standard English word. “UNTIE” is valid but uses I and T. “LITHE” uses L, I, T, H, E. Among these, “UNTIE” is common and uses U, N, T, I, E with E fixed at the end. However, U is less common than T or N. 

Another candidate: “CLEAN” but it ends with N, not E. “ELITE” uses E twice (bad). “EXCEL” ends with L. 

Best candidate: “UNTIE” keeps E in place and introduces U, N, T, I. But U is less common. 

Alternative: “INLET” – ends with T, not E. 

Let’s pick a word that ends with E and uses common consonants not yet eliminated: “UNTIE” is acceptable, but “UNTIE” is 5 letters: U N T I E. All letters are new except E. 

Another good option: “TIGER” but R is eliminated. 

“WHITE” – H is new, T is new, I is new, E is fixed. Uses W, H, I, T, E. All new letters except E. 

Between “UNTIE” and “WHITE”, “WHITE” introduces more common letters (W, H, I, T) and is a valid word. 

Let’s go with WHITE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: white -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is somewhere in the word (but not in position 3, since that’s where it was in WHITE and the feedback was I(✓) meaning it is in the correct spot, so I must be in position 3).
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, W, H, T.

So far the pattern is:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: E

We need two new consonants and one new vowel that haven’t been eliminated. Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, plus vowels U and Y (Y can act as a vowel).

A good candidate word would fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:
- BLINE
- CLINE
- DLINE
- FLINE
- GLINE
- MINCE
- PLINE
- BRINE
- CRANE (but A is out)
- DINGE
- FLING (but G is new, but word ends with E? FLING ends with G)
- BLIME (but M is new, B is new)

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in E with I in the third position: BLIME, CLIME, FLIME, PLIME, BRINE, CRINE, DRINE, PRINE, etc.

Among these, “BRINE” uses B, R, I, N, E. R was already ruled out in AROSE (R(x)), so BRINE is invalid.

“CLIME” uses C, L, I, M, E – all letters are new (C, L, M not yet tested). C and L are common, M is moderate frequency.

“DLIME” is not a valid English word.

“PLIME” is not a valid English word.

“BLIME” is not a valid English word.

“CRINE” is a valid word (relating to the skin), but R is already eliminated.

“PRINE” is valid (a pruned tree), but R is eliminated.

“MINCE” uses M, I, N, C, E – all new letters except I and E (which we know are in the word). M, I, N, C haven’t been ruled out yet.

“MINCE” fits the pattern _ _ I _ E (M I N C E), but wait: I is in position 2 here, but we know I must be in position 3. So MINCE doesn’t fit.

Let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ I _ E (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and E). So words like:
- B I _ _ E – but I is in position 2, not 3.
- _ I _ _ E – this is the correct pattern (positions 2 and 3: _ I _ _ E is not right, positions are 1-2-3-4-5, so the pattern is _ _ I _ E.

Valid English words with _ _ I _ E:
- BLIME (invalid)
- CLIME
- FLIME (invalid)
- PLIME (invalid)
- BRINE (invalid, R out)
- CRINE (invalid, R out)
- DRINE (invalid, R out)
- PRINE (invalid, R out)
- BLADE (but A is out)
- CLIDE (but D is new, C, L, I, D, E – but is CLIDE a word? No)
- FLITE (but T is out)
- GLIDE (but D is new, G, L, I, D, E – but is GLIDE a word? Yes, but D is new, G is new)

Actually, “GLIDE” is a valid word: G L I D E. All letters are new except I and E, and it fits _ _ I _ E pattern (positions 3: I, 5: E).

Similarly, “CLIDE” is not a word, but “CLIMB” is not ending with E.

Another valid word: “FLITE” – but T is out.

“PLUME” – but U is new, P, L, U, M, E – but I must be in position 3, so _ _ I _ E.

Let me think systematically: the pattern is _ _ I _ E. Valid English words:
- AGILE – A is out
- AMBLE – A is out
- ANGEL – A is out
- AROSE – A, R, O, S are out
- AWEIE – not a word
- BAGIE – not a word
- BALIE – not a word
- BAMIE – not a word
- CANOE – A, O are out
- CELLO – O is out
- CHIME – C, H, M are new, but H is out (from WHITE: H(x))
- CHIME: C, H, I, M, E. H is out, so invalid.
- DIME – too short
- ELITE – E is fixed at 5, I at 3: E L I T E – but T is out
- ENIME – not a word
- FABLE – A, B, L are new, but A is out
- FABLE: A is out
- FENCE – A, N, C are new, but A is out
- FENCE: A is out
- FIQUE – but F, I, Q, U, E – but Q is uncommon
- GLIDE – G, L, I, D, E. G, L, D are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- GRIME – G, R, I, M, E. R is out
- HIME – not a word
- JIGME – not a word
- KILOE – not a word
- LIGNE – not a word
- MIDGE – M, I, D, G, E. M, D, G are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- NIBLE – not a word
- OILED – A, O are out
- PILED – A is out
- PLIME – not a word
- PRINE – R is out
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. Q is uncommon, but U is new, N is new. Valid word.
- SABLE – A, S are out
- SCALE – A, S, C are out
- SCREE – S, C, R, E are out
- SHINE – S, H are out
- SKINE – S, K, I, N, E. S is out
- SPICE – S, P, I, C, E. S is out
- STONE – S, T are out
- SWINE – S, W are out
- THINE – T, H are out
- TIGER – T, R are out
- TONIE – T, O are out
- TRICE – T, R are out
- TRIKE – T, R are out
- VIGNE – not a word
- WIGLE – W, G, L are new, but W is out
- WIPED – W is out
- YODEL – not a word

From these, valid words fitting _ _ I _ E with new letters:
- GLIDE (G, L, D are new)
- MIDGE (M, D, G are new)
- QUINE (Q, U, N are new)

Among these, “GLIDE” uses G, L, I, D, E. All letters except I and E are new. G and L are common, D is moderate. This seems like the best next guess.

So the next guess is GLIDE.Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5)
- I is in the correct position (position 3)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, W, H, T

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities.

A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters and that covers a range of vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning for common letters

This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)

So we know:
- Word ends with E
- No A, R, O, S appear anywhere else

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the final spot
2. Introduce new, common letters not yet tested (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, O, S

A word that satisfies these and uses common letters is “TUNNE” but “TUNNE” isn’t a standard English word. “UNTIE” is valid but uses I and T. “LITHE” uses L, I, T, H, E. Among these, “UNTIE” is common and uses U, N, T, I, E with E fixed at the end. However, U is less common than T or N. 

Another candidate: “CLEAN” but it ends with N, not E. “ELITE” uses E twice (bad). “EXCEL” ends with L. 

Best candidate: “UNTIE” keeps E in place and introduces U, N, T, I. But U is less common. 

Alternative: “INLET” – ends with T, not E. 

Let’s pick a word that ends with E and uses common consonants not yet eliminated: “UNTIE” is acceptable, but “UNTIE” is 5 letters: U N T I E. All letters are new except E. 

Another good option: “TIGER” but R is eliminated. 

“WHITE” – H is new, T is new, I is new, E is fixed. Uses W, H, I, T, E. All new letters except E. 

Between “UNTIE” and “WHITE”, “WHITE” introduces more common letters (W, H, I, T) and is a valid word. 

Let’s go with WHITE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: white -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is somewhere in the word (but not in position 3, since that’s where it was in WHITE and the feedback was I(✓) meaning it is in the correct spot, so I must be in position 3).
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, W, H, T.

So far the pattern is:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: E

We need two new consonants and one new vowel that haven’t been eliminated. Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, plus vowels U and Y (Y can act as a vowel).

A good candidate word would fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:
- BLINE
- CLINE
- DLINE
- FLINE
- GLINE
- MINCE
- PLINE
- BRINE
- CRANE (but A is out)
- DINGE
- FLING (but G is new, but word ends with E? FLING ends with G)
- BLIME (but M is new, B is new)

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in E with I in the third position: BLIME, CLIME, FLIME, PLIME, BRINE, CRINE, DRINE, PRINE, etc.

Among these, “BRINE” uses B, R, I, N, E. R was already ruled out in AROSE (R(x)), so BRINE is invalid.

“CLIME” uses C, L, I, M, E – all letters are new (C, L, M not yet tested). C and L are common, M is moderate frequency.

“DLIME” is not a valid English word.

“PLIME” is not a valid English word.

“BLIME” is not a valid English word.

“CRINE” is a valid word (relating to the skin), but R is already eliminated.

“PRINE” is valid (a pruned tree), but R is eliminated.

“MINCE” uses M, I, N, C, E – all new letters except I and E (which we know are in the word). M, I, N, C haven’t been ruled out yet.

“MINCE” fits the pattern _ _ I _ E (M I N C E), but wait: I is in position 2 here, but we know I must be in position 3. So MINCE doesn’t fit.

Let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ I _ E (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and E). So words like:
- B I _ _ E – but I is in position 2, not 3.
- _ I _ _ E – this is the correct pattern (positions 2 and 3: _ I _ _ E is not right, positions are 1-2-3-4-5, so the pattern is _ _ I _ E.

Valid English words with _ _ I _ E:
- BLIME (invalid)
- CLIME
- FLIME (invalid)
- PLIME (invalid)
- BRINE (invalid, R out)
- CRINE (invalid, R out)
- DRINE (invalid, R out)
- PRINE (invalid, R out)
- BLADE (but A is out)
- CLIDE (but D is new, C, L, I, D, E – but is CLIDE a word? No)
- FLITE (but T is out)
- GLIDE (but D is new, G, L, I, D, E – but is GLIDE a word? Yes, but D is new, G is new)

Actually, “GLIDE” is a valid word: G L I D E. All letters are new except I and E, and it fits _ _ I _ E pattern (positions 3: I, 5: E).

Similarly, “CLIDE” is not a word, but “CLIMB” is not ending with E.

Another valid word: “FLITE” – but T is out.

“PLUME” – but U is new, P, L, U, M, E – but I must be in position 3, so _ _ I _ E.

Let me think systematically: the pattern is _ _ I _ E. Valid English words:
- AGILE – A is out
- AMBLE – A is out
- ANGEL – A is out
- AROSE – A, R, O, S are out
- AWEIE – not a word
- BAGIE – not a word
- BALIE – not a word
- BAMIE – not a word
- CANOE – A, O are out
- CELLO – O is out
- CHIME – C, H, M are new, but H is out (from WHITE: H(x))
- CHIME: C, H, I, M, E. H is out, so invalid.
- DIME – too short
- ELITE – E is fixed at 5, I at 3: E L I T E – but T is out
- ENIME – not a word
- FABLE – A, B, L are new, but A is out
- FABLE: A is out
- FENCE – A, N, C are new, but A is out
- FENCE: A is out
- FIQUE – but F, I, Q, U, E – but Q is uncommon
- GLIDE – G, L, I, D, E. G, L, D are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- GRIME – G, R, I, M, E. R is out
- HIME – not a word
- JIGME – not a word
- KILOE – not a word
- LIGNE – not a word
- MIDGE – M, I, D, G, E. M, D, G are new, I, E known. Valid word.
- NIBLE – not a word
- OILED – A, O are out
- PILED – A is out
- PLIME – not a word
- PRINE – R is out
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. Q is uncommon, but U is new, N is new. Valid word.
- SABLE – A, S are out
- SCALE – A, S, C are out
- SCREE – S, C, R, E are out
- SHINE – S, H are out
- SKINE – S, K, I, N, E. S is out
- SPICE – S, P, I, C, E. S is out
- STONE – S, T are out
- SWINE – S, W are out
- THINE – T, H are out
- TIGER – T, R are out
- TONIE – T, O are out
- TRICE – T, R are out
- TRIKE – T, R are out
- VIGNE – not a word
- WIGLE – W, G, L are new, but W is out
- WIPED – W is out
- YODEL – not a word

From these, valid words fitting _ _ I _ E with new letters:
- GLIDE (G, L, D are new)
- MIDGE (M, D, G are new)
- QUINE (Q, U, N are new)

Among these, “GLIDE” uses G, L, I, D, E. All letters except I and E are new. G and L are common, D is moderate. This seems like the best next guess.

So the next guess is GLIDE.Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5)
- I is in the correct position (position 3)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, W, H, T

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ I _ E using new letters. The valid candidate that fits is:

- BLINE – but L is available, B is new, N is new, I and E are known. Valid word.
- BLIME – not a valid word.
- BRINE – R is ruled out.
- CLIME – C is new, L is new, I and E known. Valid word.
- FLIME – F is new, L is new, M is new, but is FLIME a word? No.
- FLINE – F is new, L is new, I and E known. Valid word.
- PLIME – not a valid word.
- PRIME – P is new, R is ruled out.
- SLIME – S is ruled out.
- ULIME – not a valid word.

Valid words from the list:
- BLINE
- CLIME
- FLINE

Among these, ""FLIME"" is not valid, so between BLINE and CLIME. Both are valid, but ""CLIME"" uses C and L which are common. Let's choose CLIME.

But wait, let me double-check:
- BLINE: B, L, I, N, E – all letters are available (B, L, N not ruled out)
- CLIME: C, L, I, M, E – all letters available

Both are valid. I'll choose CLIME as it uses C which wasn't tested yet in this position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From all feedback so far:

- Position 5 is E (✓ every time).
- Position 3 is I (✓ every time).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, W, H, T, G, D, C, M.

Pattern: _ _ I _ E

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, F, J, K, N, P, U, V, Y, plus vowel U and Y.

We also learned from Guess 3 (glide) that L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (L got “-”).

So L must be in either position 1 or position 4.

Looking for 5-letter English words matching _ _ I _ E with:
- L in position 1 or 4
- No ruled-out letters

Possible candidates:
1. FLING – ends with G (invalid, D and G ruled out)
2. BLIME – not a valid word
3. FLIME – invalid
4. ULIME – invalid
5. PLINE – P, L, I, N, E – all allowed, L in position 2 is now ruled out (from glide), so PLINE has L in position 2 → invalid
6. FLINE – F, L, I, N, E – L in position 2 is ruled out → invalid
7. BLINE – B, L, I, N, E – L in position 2 is ruled out → invalid
8. KLINE – K, L, I, N, E – L in position 2 is ruled out → invalid
9. JLINE – invalid word
10. PLINE – already noted invalid due to L in position 2

Wait, we must have L in position 1 or 4.

Let’s list words with L in 1 or 4:

- L _ I _ E: LI…E – only 4 letters, so no 5-letter words like this.
- _ _ I L E: Need to find valid words ending …ILE.

Valid English 5-letter words ending in …ILE:
- FABLE – A is out
- CABLE – A, C out
- GABLE – A, G out
- STILE – S, T out
- HINGE – H, G out
- LINGE – not common
- MINCE – M, I in wrong spot
- PINE – too short
- RIGID – R, I, D out
- SUGIE – S, U, G, I out
- VIGILE – too long
- WIGLE – W, G out
- YODEL – D, Y, O out

None of these fit because:
- Must have I in position 3
- Must end with E
- Must contain L (from glide/clime feedback)
- Cannot use any ruled-out letters

Looking again, the only pattern that fits is _ _ I _ E with L in position 4.

So we need words like _ _ I L E.

Valid English words:
- F I N L E – not a word
- P I N L E – not a word
- B I N L E – not a word
- V I N L E – not a word
- P U L L E – not a word
- P I N E – too short
- F U N L E – not a word

Actually, let me think of all valid 5-letter English words ending in …ILE:

- STILE – S, T out
- LITRE – doesn’t end with E
- ABILE – A out
- ADIEU – doesn’t fit
- AGILE – A, G out
- ELITE – E, L, I in wrong spot (L in 4, I in 2)
- PLATE – doesn’t have I
- PRINE – R out
- SLATE – doesn’t have I
- STALE – doesn’t have I
- STONE – doesn’t have I
- SWILE – S, W out
- THINE – T, H out
- TRIKE – T, R out
- ULTRA – doesn’t have I
- VIGILE – too long
- WIGLE – W, G out
- YODEL – D, Y, O out

None of these fit the pattern _ _ I _ E with L in position 4.

Wait, let me double-check the dictionary:

Valid 5-letter English words ending in …ILE:
- STILE (but S, T out)
- LITRE (doesn’t end with E)
- ABILE (A out)
- AGILE (A, G out)
- ELITE (E, L, I in positions 1,4,2 – but we need I in 3)
- PLATE (no I)
- PRINE (R out)
- SLATE (no I)
- STALE (no I)
- STONE (no I)
- SWILE (S, W out)
- THINE (T, H out)
- TRIKE (T, R out)
- ULTRA (no I)
- VIGILE (too long)
- WIGLE (W, G out)
- YODEL (D, Y, O out)

It appears there are no common 5-letter English words fitting _ _ I _ E with L in position 4 and no ruled-out letters.

However, I missed ""FLITE"" but T is out.

Wait, let me try ""ULINE"" – but U is allowed, L in 4, I in 3, E in 5 – but is ULINE a word? Yes, it’s a valid word (a thin strip of wood).

So ULINE: U, L, I, N, E – all letters allowed, L in position 4, I in 3, E in 5.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ULINE.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:\n- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)\n- 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- All unique letters\n- Good letter positioning for common letters\n\nThis should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)\n- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)\n\nSo we know:\n- Word ends with E\n- No A, R, O, S appear anywhere else\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

Among these, “UNTIE” is common and uses U, N, T, I, E with E fixed at the end. However, U is less common than T or N. \n\nAnother candidate: “CLEAN” but it ends with N, not E. “ELITE” uses E twice (bad). “EXCEL” ends with L. \n\nBest candidate: “UNTIE” keeps E in place and introduces U, N, T, I. But U is less common. \n\nAlternative: “INLET” – ends with T, not E. \n\nLet’s pick a word that ends with E and uses common consonants not yet eliminated: “UNTIE” is acceptable, but “UNTIE” is 5 letters: U N T I E.

Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, plus vowels U and Y (Y can act as a vowel).\n\nA good candidate word would fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and use new letters. Some possibilities:\n- BLINE\n- CLINE\n- DLINE\n- FLINE\n- GLINE\n- MINCE\n- PLINE\n- BRINE\n- CRANE (but A is out)\n- DINGE\n- FLING (but G is new, but word ends with E?

R was already ruled out in AROSE (R(x)), so BRINE is invalid.\n\n“CLIME” uses C, L, I, M, E – all letters are new (C, L, M not yet tested). C and L are common, M is moderate frequency.\n\n“DLIME” is not a valid English word.\n\n“PLIME” is not a valid English word.\n\n“BLIME” is not a valid English word.\n\n“CRINE” is a valid word (relating to the skin), but R is already eliminated.\n\n“PRINE” is valid (a pruned tree), but R is eliminated.\n\n“MINCE” uses M, I, N, C, E – all new letters except I and E (which we know are in the word).

So MINCE doesn’t fit.\n\nLet me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ I _ E (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and E). So words like:\n- B I _ _ E – but I is in position 2, not 3.\n- _ I _ _ E – this is the correct pattern (positions 2 and 3: _ I _ _ E is not right, positions are 1-2-3-4-5, so the pattern is _ _ I _ E.\n\nValid English words with _ _ I _ E:\n- BLIME (invalid)\n- CLIME\n- FLIME (invalid)\n- PLIME (invalid)\n- BRINE (invalid, R out)\n- CRINE (invalid, R out)\n- DRINE (invalid, R out)\n- PRINE (invalid, R out)\n- BLADE (but A is out)\n- CLIDE (but D is new, C, L, I, D, E – but is CLIDE a word?

From every guess we now know:

- Positions 3 and 5 are locked: I _ I _ E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
  A, R, O, S, W, H, T, G, D, C, M, U, N  
  (14 letters ruled out)

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it got “-” every time).  
  Therefore L must be in position 1.

So the pattern is: L _ I _ E

We still need two distinct letters (for positions 2 and 4) chosen from the unused set:  
B, F, J, K, P, V, Y   (plus any other consonants/vowels not yet eliminated)

Scanning the dictionary for 5-letter English words that fit L _ I _ E:

- L I E _ _ – too short  
- L _ I _ E – look for valid fills:

  – L I E N E  (invalid, N out)  
  – L I F E _  (too short)  
  – L I F E N  (invalid)  
  – L I F E D  (invalid)  
  – L I F E K  (invalid)  
  – L I F E Y  (invalid)  
  – L I F E B  (invalid)  
  – L I F E V  (invalid)  
  – L I F E J  (invalid)  

Actually we need to fill positions 2 and 4.  
Valid words:

- L I F E _  – nothing ends with E  
- L I N E _  – N out  
- L I D E _  – D out
