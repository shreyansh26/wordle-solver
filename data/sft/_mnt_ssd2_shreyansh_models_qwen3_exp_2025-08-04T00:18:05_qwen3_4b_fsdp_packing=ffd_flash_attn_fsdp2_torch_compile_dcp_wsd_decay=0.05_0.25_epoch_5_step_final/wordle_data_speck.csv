### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of the most common letters and includes 3 vowels, which is efficient for elimination.

However, ""AROSE"" has O which is slightly less common than E or A. ""SLATE"" is also strong with S, L, A, T, E.

Between these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- E is in the word but not in position 5 → E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- L, A, T are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far:
S _ _ _ _
with an E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoiding L, A, T.

Letters we know are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E in positions 2-4.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the S in position 1
2. Place the E in a new position (2, 3, or 4)
3. Introduce new common letters to test

Possible candidates:
- S E E D Y (but Y is less common)
- S H E L F (but L is excluded)
- S P E E D (double E, but D is okay)
- S M E L T (but L and T are excluded)
- S C E N E (C, N are good)
- S W E E T (but T is excluded)
- S H E E K (K is okay)
- S P E C K (P, C, K are okay)

Among these, ""SPECK"" tests P, C, K while keeping S and placing E in position 3. This seems like a strong choice.

Alternatively, ""SCENE"" is also good (S, C, N, E), but we need to place E in positions 2-4. ""SCENE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed.

Between SPECK and SCENE, both are strong. I'll choose SCENE as it tests C and N which are very common.

Wait, let me double-check:
- SCENE: S(1) C(2) E(3) N(4) E(5) → but E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback E(-)), so SCENE has E in position 5 which is invalid.

Oops, that's a mistake. The second E in SCENE would be in position 5, which is not allowed. So SCENE is invalid.

Next best: SPECK (E in position 3, allowed), or SKEPT (but T is excluded).

Another option: SNEER (but E in position 5 is invalid).

Good option: SPECK (S, P, E, C, K) - tests P, C, K with E in position 3.

Another candidate: SHOCK (S, H, O, C, K) - tests H, O, C, K with E not present, but we know E must be in the word, so this is bad.

Need to include E. So SPECK is better.

Final choice: SPECK
