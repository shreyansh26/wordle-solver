From the feedback on ""arose"":
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

Next, I want to test new common letters while respecting these constraints. The remaining high-frequency letters are T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that ends with E and avoids A, R, O, S.

Good candidates: ""tinea"", ""elite"", ""chute"", ""hinge"", ""unite"", ""tulip"" (but that’s 5 letters too). Among these, ""elite"" uses very common letters (E is already known, so L, I, T) and is valid.

However, ""elite"" has two E’s, which might not add new info. Instead, ""tulip"" is better because it tests T, U, L, I, P.

But ""tulip"" has 5 unique letters and ends with E, and avoids A, R, O, S.

Actually, let me think of a word that ends with E and uses new letters: ""unite"" (U, N, I, T, E) is good.

But ""unite"" has E in the last position (correct) and tests U, N, I, T.

Yes, this seems optimal.

Another option: ""tulip"" but that’s T, U, L, I, P. Both are valid, but ""unite"" tests more common letters (U, N, I, T).

I’ll go with ""unite"".

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. unite → U(-) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   – E is still correct in position 5.
   – I is correct in position 3.
   – U is in the word but not in position 1.
   – N and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ E
- Contains: U (but not in position 1)
- Excludes: A, R, O, S, N, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Has U somewhere (but not at the start).
4. Does not contain A, R, O, S, N, T.

Possible letters left (excluding the banned ones and using common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U and I, E.

Let’s list some candidate words fitting _ I _ _ E:
- B I _ _ E → “bidge”? No, not common.
- C I _ _ E → “cive”? Not valid.
- D I _ _ E → “dive” has V, but D, I, V, E – but we need 5 letters.
- F I _ _ E → “fifie”? Not valid.
- H I _ _ E → “hike” is 4 letters.
- L I _ _ E → “live” is 4.
- M I _ _ E → “mice” is 4.
- P I _ _ E → “pipe” is 4.
- W I _ _ E → “wile” is 4.
- U must appear somewhere after position 1.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words:
- “quill” has Q, U, I, L, L – but T is excluded, but “quill” has L twice, but that’s okay. But does it fit _ I _ _ E? No, I is position 3, so “quill” is Q U I L L – I is position 3, E is position 5? No, “quill” ends with L.

Another approach: since I is position 3 and E is position 5, and U must appear somewhere (not position 1), possible positions for U: 2 or 4.

So possible patterns:
- _ U I _ E
- _ I _ U E

Let’s list words for both patterns.

Pattern _ U I _ E:
- B U I _ E → “buile”? Not valid.
- C U I _ E → “cuine”? Not valid.
- D U I _ E → “duine”? Not valid.
- F U I _ E → “fuile”? Not valid.
- H U I _ E → “huile”? Not valid.
- L U I _ E → “luice”? Not valid.
- M U I _ E → “muice”? Not valid.
- P U I _ E → “puise”? Not valid.
- S U I _ E → “suide”? Not valid (S is excluded).
- T U I _ E → “tuile”? T is excluded.

Pattern _ I _ U E:
- B I _ U E → “bique”? Not valid.
- C I _ U E → “cique”? Not valid.
- D I _ U E → “dique”? Not valid.
- F I _ U E → “fique”? Not valid.
- H I _ U E → “hique”? Not valid.
- L I _ U E → “lique”? L, I, Q, U, E – “lique” is a valid word (a variant spelling of “liqueur”).
- M I _ U E → “mique”? Not valid.
- P I _ U E → “pique” – yes, “pique” is a valid word (a type of fabric or a sharp remark).
- V I _ U E → “vique”? Not valid.
- W I _ U E → “wique”? Not valid.

Between “lique” and “pique”, both fit the constraints:
- “lique” uses L, I, Q, U, E – no banned letters.
- “pique” uses P, I, Q, U, E – no banned letters.

“Pique” is more common, so I’ll choose that.

But wait, does “pique” have all letters unique? P, I, Q, U, E – yes, no duplicates.

So the next guess is “pique”.

""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

Next, I want to test new common letters while respecting these constraints. The remaining high-frequency letters are T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that ends with E and avoids A, R, O, S.

Good candidates: ""tinea"", ""elite"", ""chute"", ""hinge"", ""unite"", ""tulip"" (but that’s 5 letters too). Among these, ""elite"" uses very common letters (E is already known, so L, I, T) and is valid.

However, ""elite"" has two E’s, which might not add new info. Instead, ""tulip"" is better because it tests T, U, L, I, P.

But ""tulip"" has 5 unique letters and ends with E, and avoids A, R, O, S.

Actually, let me think of a word that ends with E and uses new letters: ""unite"" (U, N, I, T, E) is good.

But ""unite"" has E in the last position (correct) and tests U, N, I, T.

Yes, this seems optimal.

Another option: ""tulip"" but that’s T, U, L, I, P. Both are valid, but ""unite"" tests more common letters (U, N, I, T).

I’ll go with ""unite"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: unite -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. unite → U(-) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   – E is still correct in position 5.
   – I is correct in position 3.
   – U is in the word but not in position 1.
   – N and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ E
- Contains: U (but not in position 1)
- Excludes: A, R, O, S, N, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Has U somewhere (but not at the start).
4. Does not contain A, R, O, S, N, T.

Possible letters left (excluding the banned ones and using common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U and I, E.

Let’s list some candidate words fitting _ I _ _ E:
- B I _ _ E → “bidge”? No, not common.
- C I _ _ E → “cive”? Not valid.
- D I _ _ E → “dive” has V, but D, I, V, E – but we need 5 letters.
- F I _ _ E → “fifie”? Not valid.
- H I _ _ E → “hike” is 4 letters.
- L I _ _ E → “live” is 4.
- M I _ _ E → “mice” is 4.
- P I _ _ E → “pipe” is 4.
- W I _ _ E → “wile” is 4.
- U must appear somewhere after position 1.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words:
- “quill” has Q, U, I, L, L – but T is excluded, but “quill” has L twice, but that’s okay. But does it fit _ I _ _ E? No, I is position 3, so “quill” is Q U I L L – I is position 3, E is position 5? No, “quill” ends with L.

Another approach: since I is position 3 and E is position 5, and U must appear somewhere (not position 1), possible positions for U: 2 or 4.

So possible patterns:
- _ U I _ E
- _ I _ U E

Let’s list words for both patterns.

Pattern _ U I _ E:
- B U I _ E → “buile”? Not valid.
- C U I _ E → “cuine”? Not valid.
- D U I _ E → “duine”? Not valid.
- F U I _ E → “fuile”? Not valid.
- H U I _ E → “huile”? Not valid.
- L U I _ E → “luice”? Not valid.
- M U I _ E → “muice”? Not valid.
- P U I _ E → “puise”? Not valid.
- S U I _ E → “suide”? Not valid (S is excluded).
- T U I _ E → “tuile”? T is excluded.

Pattern _ I _ U E:
- B I _ U E → “bique”? Not valid.
- C I _ U E → “cique”? Not valid.
- D I _ U E → “dique”? Not valid.
- F I _ U E → “fique”? Not valid.
- H I _ U E → “hique”? Not valid.
- L I _ U E → “lique”? L, I, Q, U, E – “lique” is a valid word (a variant spelling of “liqueur”).
- M I _ U E → “mique”? Not valid.
- P I _ U E → “pique” – yes, “pique” is a valid word (a type of fabric or a sharp remark).
- V I _ U E → “vique”? Not valid.
- W I _ U E → “wique”? Not valid.

Between “lique” and “pique”, both fit the constraints:
- “lique” uses L, I, Q, U, E – no banned letters.
- “pique” uses P, I, Q, U, E – no banned letters.

“Pique” is more common, so I’ll choose that.

But wait, does “pique” have all letters unique? P, I, Q, U, E – yes, no duplicates.

So the next guess is “pique”.

Let’s summarize what we now know from all feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – A, R, O, S are not in the word.

2. unite → U(-) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – I is correct in position 3.
   – U is in the word but not in position 1.
   – N and T are not in the word.

3. pique → P(x) I(-) Q(x) U(-) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – I is in the word but not in position 2 (it is actually confirmed in position 3 from unite, so this reinforces that).
   – Q is not in the word.
   – P is not in the word.
   – U is in the word but not in position 4 (and from unite it is not in position 1).

So the pattern is:
- _ _ I _ E
- Must contain U (but U cannot be in positions 1 or 4)
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, N, T, P, Q

Therefore U must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot for it).

Hence the word must be: _ U I _ E

Now we need to find valid 5-letter words that fit _ U I _ E and use only allowed letters.

Possible letters left (excluding banned: A,R,O,S,N,T,P,Q):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U, I, E.

Looking for words _ U I _ E:
- B U I L E → “buile” – not a valid word.
- C U I L E → “cuile” – not valid.
- D U I L E → “duile” – not valid.
- F U I L E → “fuile” – not valid.
- H U I L E → “huile” – not valid.
- L U I L E → “luile” – not valid.
- M U I L E → “muile” – not valid.
- V U I L E → “vuile” – not valid.
- W U I L E → “wuile” – not valid.

Wait, let me think of other combinations:
- B U I N E → N is excluded.
- C U I N E → N is excluded.
- D U I N E → N is excluded.
- F U I N E → N is excluded.
- G U I L E → “guile” – valid word (a trick or deceit).
- H U I L E → not valid.
- J U I L E → not valid.
- K U I L E → not valid.
- L U I L E → not valid.
- M U I L E → not valid.
- V U I L E → not valid.
- W U I L E → not valid.

“Guile” fits perfectly:
- G, U, I, L, E – none of the banned letters are used.
- Pattern: G U I L E → _ U I _ E with L in position 4.

This seems to be the only valid common word fitting the constraints. Let’s try it.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.

Next, I want to test new common letters while respecting these constraints. The remaining high-frequency letters are T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that ends with E and avoids A, R, O, S.

Good candidates: ""tinea"", ""elite"", ""chute"", ""hinge"", ""unite"", ""tulip"" (but that’s 5 letters too). Among these, ""elite"" uses very common letters (E is already known, so L, I, T) and is valid.

However, ""elite"" has two E’s, which might not add new info. Instead, ""tulip"" is better because it tests T, U, L, I, P.

But ""tulip"" has 5 unique letters and ends with E, and avoids A, R, O, S.

Actually, let me think of a word that ends with E and uses new letters: ""unite"" (U, N, I, T, E) is good.

Yes, this seems optimal.

2. Has E in position 5.
3. Has U somewhere (but not at the start).
4. Does not contain A, R, O, S, N, T.

Possible letters left (excluding the banned ones and using common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U and I, E.

Let’s list some candidate words fitting _ I _ _ E:
- B I _ _ E → “bidge”? No, not common.
- C I _ _ E → “cive”? Not valid.
- D I _ _ E → “dive” has V, but D, I, V, E – but we need 5 letters.

- H I _ _ E → “hike” is 4 letters.
- L I _ _ E → “live” is 4.
- M I _ _ E → “mice” is 4.
- P I _ _ E → “pipe” is 4.
- W I _ _ E → “wile” is 4.
- U must appear somewhere after position 1.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words:
- “quill” has Q, U, I, L, L – but T is excluded, but “quill” has L twice, but that’s okay. But does it fit _ I _ _ E? No, I is position 3, so “quill” is Q U I L L – I is position 3, E is position 5? No, “quill” ends with L.

Another approach: since I is position 3 and E is position 5, and U must appear somewhere (not position 1), possible positions for U: 2 or 4.

So possible patterns:
- _ U I _ E

Let’s list words for both patterns.

- C I _ U E → “cique”? Not valid.
- D I _ U E → “dique”? Not valid.
- F I _ U E → “fique”? Not valid.
- H I _ U E → “hique”? Not valid.
- L I _ U E → “lique”? L, I, Q, U, E – “lique” is a valid word (a variant spelling of “liqueur”).
- M I _ U E → “mique”? Not valid.
- P I _ U E → “pique” – yes, “pique” is a valid word (a type of fabric or a sharp remark).
- V I _ U E → “vique”? Not valid.
- W I _ U E → “wique”? Not valid.

Between “lique” and “pique”, both fit the constraints:
- “lique” uses L, I, Q, U, E – no banned letters.
- “pique” uses P, I, Q, U, E – no banned letters.

“Pique” is more common, so I’ll choose that.

But wait, does “pique” have all letters unique? P, I, Q, U, E – yes, no duplicates.

So the next guess is “pique”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

Guess 3: pique -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) Q(x) U(-) E(✓)

Let’s summarize what we now know from all feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – A, R, O, S are not in the word.

2. unite → U(-) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – I is correct in position 3.
   – U is in the word but not in position 1.
   – N and T are not in the word.

3. pique → P(x) I(-) Q(x) U(-) E(✓)
   – E is correct in position 5.
   – I is in the word but not in position 2 (it is actually confirmed in position 3 from unite, so this reinforces that).
   – Q is not in the word.
   – P is not in the word.
   – U is in the word but not in position 4 (and from unite it is not in position 1).

So the pattern is:
- _ _ I _ E
- Must contain U (but U cannot be in positions 1 or 4)
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, N, T, P, Q

Therefore U must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot for it).

Hence the word must be: _ U I _ E

Now we need to find valid 5-letter words that fit _ U I _ E and use only allowed letters.

Possible letters left (excluding banned: A,R,O,S,N,T,P,Q):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U, I, E.

Looking for words _ U I _ E:
- B U I L E → “buile” – not a valid word.
- C U I L E → “cuile” – not valid.
- D U I L E → “duile” – not valid.
- F U I L E → “fuile” – not valid.
- H U I L E → “huile” – not valid.
- L U I L E → “luile” – not valid.
- M U I L E → “muile” – not valid.
- V U I L E → “vuile” – not valid.
- W U I L E → “wuile” – not valid.

Wait, let me think of other combinations:
- B U I N E → N is excluded.
- C U I N E → N is excluded.
- D U I N E → N is excluded.
- F U I N E → N is excluded.
- G U I L E → “guile” – valid word (a trick or deceit).
- H U I L E → not valid.
- J U I L E → not valid.
- K U I L E → not valid.
- L U I L E → not valid.
- M U I L E → not valid.
- V U I L E → not valid.
- W U I L E → not valid.

“Guile” fits perfectly:
- G, U, I, L, E – none of the banned letters are used.
- Pattern: G U I L E → _ U I _ E with L in position 4.

This seems to be the only valid common word fitting the constraints. Let’s try it.
