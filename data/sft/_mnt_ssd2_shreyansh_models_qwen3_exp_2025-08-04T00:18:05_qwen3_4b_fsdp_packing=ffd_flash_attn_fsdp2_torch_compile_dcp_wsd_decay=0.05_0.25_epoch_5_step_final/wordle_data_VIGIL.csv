### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters, ideally with no repeated letters, to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), each in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their correct positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore these letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

   - L received “-” in position 5 (from chili) and in position 5 (from until), so L is definitely not in position 5.

Therefore, the word must contain I and L somewhere, but:  
- I cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 ⇒ I must be in position 2 or 3.  
- L cannot be in position 5 ⇒ L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- Also, no other letters used so far can appear.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses I and L exactly once each.  
- Places I in position 2 or 3.  
- Places L somewhere else (1, 2, 3, or 4), not conflicting with I.  
- Uses only letters not in the eliminated set.

Candidate words that fit:
- If I is in position 2: possible L positions are 1, 3, 4.  
  – LI***, *I L**, **I L*, *I*L**  
  – Example: “BILGY” (but G and Y may be too obscure).  
- If I is in position 3: possible L positions are 1, 2, 4.  
  – L* I *, *L I *, *I L *  
  – Example: “FLISK” (but S is eliminated).  
  – “BLIMP” (but P may be too rare).  
  – “GLIMP” (P still issue).  
  – “PLINK” (K is still allowed, N is eliminated though).  
  – “FLICK” (C is eliminated).  
  – “FLUID” (U is eliminated).  
  – “FLING” (G is allowed, N is eliminated).  
  – “FLIPS” (S eliminated).  
  – “FLIRT” (R, T eliminated).  
  – “FLISK” (S eliminated).  
  – “FLUME” (U, E eliminated).  
  – “FLUNG” (U eliminated).  
  – “FLUNK” (U eliminated).  
  – “FLUSH” (U, S, H eliminated).  
  – “FLUTE” (U, E eliminated).  
  – “FLUXY” (U, X, Y may be acceptable).  

One valid word is “FLUNG” but U is eliminated.  
Another is “FLINT” but N and T are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUID” but U and I are already accounted for, but U is eliminated.  
Another is “FLISK” but S is eliminated.  
Another is “FLUME” but U and E are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUSH” but U, S, H are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUTE” but U and E are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUXY” but U is eliminated.  

Let’s try “PLINK” but N is eliminated.  
“GLINK” but N is eliminated.  
“BLINK” but N is eliminated.  
“FLING” but N is eliminated.  

Wait, let’s list remaining letters:  
Allowed letters (excluding eliminated A,R,O,S,E,U,N,T,C,H):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with I and L, and three other allowed letters.

Let’s try “BLIMP” – B, L, I, M, P.  
- B, L, I, M, P are all allowed.  
- I is in position 3.  
- L is in position 2.  
Positions do not conflict with previous info.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “FLIMP” – but F, L, I, M, P.  
I in 3, L in 2 – same as above.

Another: “GLIMP” – G, L, I, M, P.  
Same positions.

“PLIMP” – P, L, I, M, P (invalid, P repeats).  

“BLIMP” seems the best.

Let’s check:  
B – allowed  
L – allowed  
I – allowed  
M – allowed  
P – allowed  

Positions:  
I in 3 (allowed)  
L in 2 (allowed)  

No conflicts.

So I’ll guess BLIMP.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters, ideally with no repeated letters, to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), each in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore these letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For my second guess, I want another word with five distinct, common letters that were not used yet.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

A good choice is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) because:
- All letters are still possible.
- They are all among the top 20 most common English letters.
- No letter repeats.
- It tests five new letters in common positions.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters confirmed in the word: I and L  
- Positions confirmed:  
  – I is in position 4 (fourth letter)  
  – L is in position 5 (fifth letter)

So the pattern we’re looking for is: _ _ _ I L

We need a 5-letter word that ends in “I L” and uses none of the eliminated letters.  
Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, C, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J  
Remaining vowels: only Y is still common among the remaining letters (A, E, O, U are out and I is already used).

Let’s try to pick a word that uses three fresh consonants plus the confirmed I and L.  
A good candidate is “CHILI”:
- Ends in “I L” ✓  
- Uses C, H, F (all still possible)  
- All letters are distinct from the eliminated set.

This should give us more information about C, H, and F.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, H, B, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word:  
I and L (both confirmed from Guess 2 and Guess 3, but never in the positions tried so far)

Positional constraints we have learned:
- I cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (tried in those positions and marked “-” or “x”).  
  ⇒ I must be in position 2 or 3.
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (tried in those positions and marked “-” or “x”).  
  ⇒ L must be in position 1 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L exactly once each.
2. Places I in position 2 or 3.
3. Places L in position 1 or 4, without repeating any eliminated letters.

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated):  
D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: I in position 2  
   - L must be in position 1, 4  
   - Possible patterns:  
     L I _ _ _   (L1, I2)  
     _ I L _ _   (I2, L3 – but L3 is eliminated) – invalid  
     _ I _ L _   (I2, L4)  
     _ I _ _ L   (I2, L5 – but L5 is eliminated) – invalid  

Case 2: I in position 3  
   - L must be in position 1 or 4  
   - Possible patterns:  
     L _ I _ _   (L1, I3)  
     _ _ I L _   (I3, L4)  

So valid patterns are:  
- L I _ _ _  
- _ I _ L _  
- L _ I _ _  
- _ _ I L _

We need to fill the blanks with three distinct letters from the remaining set {D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Let’s try to find a real word for each pattern:

Pattern L I _ _ _  
Need a 5-letter word starting with LI and ending with three allowed letters.  
Possible: L I _ _ _ → LI***  
Looking for words:  
- LIVID – V, D allowed  
- LIGIT – not a word  
- LIFER – R eliminated  
- LIVOR – O eliminated  
- LIVID seems valid.

Pattern _ I _ L _  
Need _ I _ L _ → *I*L*  
Words:  
- D I L L Y – double L, Y allowed but L repeats  
- F I L L Y – double L  
- G I L L Y – double L  
- V I L L Y – double L  
- W I L L Y – double L  
- Z I L L Y – double L  
- J I L L Y – double L  
- K I L L Y – double L  
- Q I L L Y – double L  
- D I L L Y etc. all have double L which we don’t want.

Pattern L _ I _ _  
Need L _ I _ _ → L* I* _  
Words:  
- L E I N – E eliminated  
- L U I N – U eliminated  
- L A I N – A eliminated  
- L O I N – O eliminated  
- L I N G – N eliminated  
- L I D A – A eliminated  
- L I F E – E eliminated  
- L I F T – T eliminated  
- L I G A – A eliminated  
- L I G E – E eliminated  
- L I G Y – possible, but LIGY_ not a word  
- L I V A – A eliminated  
- L I V E – E eliminated  
- L I V Y – not a word  
- L I Z Y – not a word  
- L I D Y – not a word  

Pattern _ _ I L _  
Need _ _ I L _ → **I L** at positions 3-4  
Words:  
- D I L L Y – double L  
- F I L L Y – double L  
- G I L L Y – double L  
- V I L L Y – double L  
- W I L L Y – double L  
- X I L L Y – double L  
- Y I L L Y – double L  
- Z I L L Y – double L  
- J I L L Y – double L  
- Q I L L Y – double L  

All these have double L, which we don’t want.

Therefore, the only valid word we can find without repeating letters or using eliminated ones is **LIVID**.

Let’s check:  
L – allowed (never eliminated)  
I – allowed (never eliminated)  
V – allowed  
I – already used  
D – allowed  

But LIVID has two I’s, and we don’t know if I is allowed to appear twice. The problem says “5-letter word” but doesn’t specify letters are unique. However, in Wordle-like games, letters can repeat unless the word itself doesn’t contain duplicates.

Looking at LIVID: it has two I’s. Is this acceptable? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters, but we have no confirmation that I appears twice. We should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Alternative: look for other patterns.

Pattern _ I _ L _ with distinct letters:  
Need letters from {D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Possible word:  
F I G L Y – but Y may be too obscure  
V I G L Y – same issue  
D I G L Y – same  
J I G L Y – same  

None of these are valid English words.

Another approach: check if any other valid English words fit.

Looking at remaining letters and patterns, the only valid English word that fits without repeating eliminated letters is **LIVID**, even though it repeats I.

But since we have no information that I appears twice, we should prefer a word with distinct letters. Let’s see if any other word exists.

Another candidate: **FILLY** – but has double L and Y.  
**GILLY** – same.  
**WIMPY** – but M is eliminated.  
**FLUKY** – but U is eliminated.  
**CLINK** – C is eliminated.  
**BLUNT** – B, N, T eliminated.  
**SLING** – S, L, I, N, G – S, N eliminated.  

Actually, let’s re-examine the remaining letters and possible words.

Valid letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with I and L in allowed positions.

Best candidate: **FLUID** – but U is eliminated.  
**FLICK** – C, K – C eliminated.  
**FLING** – N eliminated.  
**FLUSH** – U, S, H eliminated.  
**FLUTE** – U, E eliminated.  
**FLUXY** – U eliminated.  

**GLYPH** – P eliminated.  
**GLYPH** – no I or L.

**LIVID** seems to be the only remaining valid word that contains both I and L without using eliminated letters, even though it repeats I.

Therefore, I’ll guess **LIVID**.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters, ideally with no repeated letters, to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), each in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore these letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For my second guess, I want another word with five distinct, common letters that were not used yet.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

A good choice is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) because:
- All letters are still possible.
- They are all among the top 20 most common English letters.
- No letter repeats.
- It tests five new letters in common positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:
- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters confirmed in the word: I and L  
- Positions confirmed:  
  – I is in position 4 (fourth letter)  
  – L is in position 5 (fifth letter)

So the pattern we’re looking for is: _ _ _ I L

We need a 5-letter word that ends in “I L” and uses none of the eliminated letters.  
Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, C, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J  
Remaining vowels: only Y is still common among the remaining letters (A, E, O, U are out and I is already used).

Let’s try to pick a word that uses three fresh consonants plus the confirmed I and L.  
A good candidate is “CHILI”:
- Ends in “I L” ✓  
- Uses C, H, F (all still possible)  
- All letters are distinct from the eliminated set.

This should give us more information about C, H, and F.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, H

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   I and L (both confirmed from earlier feedback)

3. Positional information we have:  
   - In Guess 2 (until), I was in position 4 and L in position 5, but both received “-” (present but wrong spot).  
     ⇒ Neither I nor L is in position 4 or 5.  
   - In Guess 3 (chili), the first I (position 1) received “-” and the second I (position 5) received “-”.  
     ⇒ I is not in position 1 or 5 either.  
   - L received “-” in position 5 (from chili) and in position 5 (from until), so L is definitely not in position 5.

Therefore, the word must contain I and L somewhere, but:  
- I cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 ⇒ I must be in position 2 or 3.  
- L cannot be in position 5 ⇒ L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- Also, no other letters used so far can appear.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses I and L exactly once each.  
- Places I in position 2 or 3.  
- Places L somewhere else (1, 2, 3, or 4), not conflicting with I.  
- Uses only letters not in the eliminated set.

Candidate words that fit:
- If I is in position 2: possible L positions are 1, 3, 4.  
  – LI***, *I L**, **I L*, *I*L**  
  – Example: “BILGY” (but G and Y may be too obscure).  
- If I is in position 3: possible L positions are 1, 2, 4.  
  – L* I *, *L I *, *I L *  
  – Example: “FLISK” (but S is eliminated).  
  – “BLIMP” (but P may be too rare).  
  – “GLIMP” (P still issue).  
  – “PLINK” (K is still allowed, N is eliminated though).  
  – “FLICK” (C is eliminated).  
  – “FLUID” (U is eliminated).  
  – “FLING” (G is allowed, N is eliminated).  
  – “FLIPS” (S eliminated).  
  – “FLIRT” (R, T eliminated).  
  – “FLISK” (S eliminated).  
  – “FLUME” (U, E eliminated).  
  – “FLUNG” (U eliminated).  
  – “FLUNK” (U eliminated).  
  – “FLUSH” (U, S, H eliminated).  
  – “FLUTE” (U, E eliminated).  
  – “FLUXY” (U, X, Y may be acceptable).  

One valid word is “FLUNG” but U is eliminated.  
Another is “FLINT” but N and T are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUID” but U and I are already accounted for, but U is eliminated.  
Another is “FLISK” but S is eliminated.  
Another is “FLUME” but U and E are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUSH” but U, S, H are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUTE” but U and E are eliminated.  
Another is “FLUXY” but U is eliminated.  

Let’s try “PLINK” but N is eliminated.  
“GLINK” but N is eliminated.  
“BLINK” but N is eliminated.  
“FLING” but N is eliminated.  

Wait, let’s list remaining letters:  
Allowed letters (excluding eliminated A,R,O,S,E,U,N,T,C,H):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with I and L, and three other allowed letters.

Let’s try “BLIMP” – B, L, I, M, P.  
- B, L, I, M, P are all allowed.  
- I is in position 3.  
- L is in position 2.  
Positions do not conflict with previous info.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “FLIMP” – but F, L, I, M, P.  
I in 3, L in 2 – same as above.

Another: “GLIMP” – G, L, I, M, P.  
Same positions.

“PLIMP” – P, L, I, M, P (invalid, P repeats).  

“BLIMP” seems the best.

Let’s check:  
B – allowed  
L – allowed  
I – allowed  
M – allowed  
P – allowed  

Positions:  
I in 3 (allowed)  
L in 2 (allowed)  

No conflicts.

So I’ll guess BLIMP.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, H, B, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word:  
I and L (both confirmed from Guess 2 and Guess 3, but never in the positions tried so far)

Positional constraints we have learned:
- I cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (tried in those positions and marked “-” or “x”).  
  ⇒ I must be in position 2 or 3.
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (tried in those positions and marked “-” or “x”).  
  ⇒ L must be in position 1 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L exactly once each.
2. Places I in position 2 or 3.
3. Places L in position 1 or 4, without repeating any eliminated letters.

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated):  
D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: I in position 2  
   - L must be in position 1, 4  
   - Possible patterns:  
     L I _ _ _   (L1, I2)  
     _ I L _ _   (I2, L3 – but L3 is eliminated) – invalid  
     _ I _ L _   (I2, L4)  
     _ I _ _ L   (I2, L5 – but L5 is eliminated) – invalid  

Case 2: I in position 3  
   - L must be in position 1 or 4  
   - Possible patterns:  
     L _ I _ _   (L1, I3)  
     _ _ I L _   (I3, L4)  

So valid patterns are:  
- L I _ _ _  
- _ I _ L _  
- L _ I _ _  
- _ _ I L _

We need to fill the blanks with three distinct letters from the remaining set {D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Let’s try to find a real word for each pattern:

Pattern L I _ _ _  
Need a 5-letter word starting with LI and ending with three allowed letters.  
Possible: L I _ _ _ → LI***  
Looking for words:  
- LIVID – V, D allowed  
- LIGIT – not a word  
- LIFER – R eliminated  
- LIVOR – O eliminated  
- LIVID seems valid.

Pattern _ I _ L _  
Need _ I _ L _ → *I*L*  
Words:  
- D I L L Y – double L, Y allowed but L repeats  
- F I L L Y – double L  
- G I L L Y – double L  
- V I L L Y – double L  
- W I L L Y – double L  
- Z I L L Y – double L  
- J I L L Y – double L  
- K I L L Y – double L  
- Q I L L Y – double L  
- D I L L Y etc. all have double L which we don’t want.

Pattern L _ I _ _  
Need L _ I _ _ → L* I* _  
Words:  
- L E I N – E eliminated  
- L U I N – U eliminated  
- L A I N – A eliminated  
- L O I N – O eliminated  
- L I N G – N eliminated  
- L I D A – A eliminated  
- L I F E – E eliminated  
- L I F T – T eliminated  
- L I G A – A eliminated  
- L I G E – E eliminated  
- L I G Y – possible, but LIGY_ not a word  
- L I V A – A eliminated  
- L I V E – E eliminated  
- L I V Y – not a word  
- L I Z Y – not a word  
- L I D Y – not a word  

Pattern _ _ I L _  
Need _ _ I L _ → **I L** at positions 3-4  
Words:  
- D I L L Y – double L  
- F I L L Y – double L  
- G I L L Y – double L  
- V I L L Y – double L  
- W I L L Y – double L  
- X I L L Y – double L  
- Y I L L Y – double L  
- Z I L L Y – double L  
- J I L L Y – double L  
- Q I L L Y – double L  

All these have double L, which we don’t want.

Therefore, the only valid word we can find without repeating letters or using eliminated ones is **LIVID**.

Let’s check:  
L – allowed (never eliminated)  
I – allowed (never eliminated)  
V – allowed  
I – already used  
D – allowed  

But LIVID has two I’s, and we don’t know if I is allowed to appear twice. The problem says “5-letter word” but doesn’t specify letters are unique. However, in Wordle-like games, letters can repeat unless the word itself doesn’t contain duplicates.

Looking at LIVID: it has two I’s. Is this acceptable? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters, but we have no confirmation that I appears twice. We should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Alternative: look for other patterns.

Pattern _ I _ L _ with distinct letters:  
Need letters from {D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Possible word:  
F I G L Y – but Y may be too obscure  
V I G L Y – same issue  
D I G L Y – same  
J I G L Y – same  

None of these are valid English words.

Another approach: check if any other valid English words fit.

Looking at remaining letters and patterns, the only valid English word that fits without repeating eliminated letters is **LIVID**, even though it repeats I.

But since we have no information that I appears twice, we should prefer a word with distinct letters. Let’s see if any other word exists.

Another candidate: **FILLY** – but has double L and Y.  
**GILLY** – same.  
**WIMPY** – but M is eliminated.  
**FLUKY** – but U is eliminated.  
**CLINK** – C is eliminated.  
**BLUNT** – B, N, T eliminated.  
**SLING** – S, L, I, N, G – S, N eliminated.  

Actually, let’s re-examine the remaining letters and possible words.

Valid letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with I and L in allowed positions.

Best candidate: **FLUID** – but U is eliminated.  
**FLICK** – C, K – C eliminated.  
**FLING** – N eliminated.  
**FLUSH** – U, S, H eliminated.  
**FLUTE** – U, E eliminated.  
**FLUXY** – U eliminated.  

**GLYPH** – P eliminated.  
**GLYPH** – no I or L.

**LIVID** seems to be the only remaining valid word that contains both I and L without using eliminated letters, even though it repeats I.

Therefore, I’ll guess **LIVID**.

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, H, B, M, P, D

Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed):
- I (✓ in positions 2 and 5, but only one I in the word, so these must be the same I)
- L (✓ in position 1 and 3, but again only one L, so this implies L is in position 1 and 3 simultaneously, which is impossible)

This contradiction means our interpretation must be wrong. Re-reading the feedback:

Guess 5: lidiv -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(✓) D(x) I(✓) V(-)

This means:
- L is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) for position 2
- D is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) for position 4
- V is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

This is impossible because I cannot be simultaneously in position 2 and 4. The feedback must be indicating that the first I is in position 2 (✓) and the second I is in position 4 (✓), implying the word has two I's. This is the only resolution.

So the word must contain:
- I in position 2 (✓)
- I in position 4 (✓)
- L somewhere, but not position 1 (-)
- V somewhere, but not position 5 (-)
- No other letters from the eliminated list.

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated): F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- Positions: _ I _ I _
- Must contain L and V somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 3, 5), with L not in position 1 and V not in position 5.

Possible patterns:
- L can be in position 3 or 5
- V can be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 5 if L is there)

Let's try:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: ?

We have V I L I _. The missing letter must be from remaining available letters (F, G, J, K, Q, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for valid English words:

- VILIF_ – no
- VILIG_ – no
- VILIK_ – no
- VILIM_ – no
- VILIP_ – no
- VILIX_ – no
- VILUY_ – no
- VILUZ_ – no

Next pattern:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

This gives F I V I L. Is this a valid word? ""FIVIL"" is not recognized.

Next pattern:
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

""GIVIL"" – not valid.

""W I L I V"" – not valid.

Next pattern:

""J I V I L"" – not valid.

Next pattern:

- Position 2: I
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

""K I V I L"" – not valid.

Next pattern:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: ?

But L cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 5 feedback: L is in word but not position 1).

Next pattern:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

But V is in position 1, L in 5, and we need to place V somewhere else (since V must be in word but not position 5). This pattern misses V somewhere.

Wait, we need to ensure both L and V are in the word. Let's try:

Positions: _ I _ I _
We need to place L and V in the remaining positions (1,3,5) with constraints:
- L not in 1
- V not in 5

Possible placements:
- L in 3, V in 1 or 5 (but 5 is invalid for V)
- L in 3, V in 1: V I L I _
- L in 5, V in 1 or 3: 
  - V I _ I L
  - _ I V I L

Let's explore:

1. V I L I _ : need last letter from available (F, G, J, K, Q, W, X, Y, Z)
   - VILIF – no
   - VILIG – no
   - VILIK – no
   - VILIQ – no
   - VILIV – no
   - VILIX – no
   - VILIZ – no

2. V I _ I L : need middle letter
   - V I F I L – ""VIFIL"" – no
   - V I G I L – ""VIGIL"" – yes, this is valid

Check constraints:
- V in position 1 (allowed, no restriction yet)
- I in 2 (✓)
- G in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (✓)
- L in 5 (allowed, since L must be somewhere and not in 1)

This satisfies all feedback:
- L is in word but not position 1 (it's in 5) ✓
- I in 2 and 4 ✓
- V is in word but not position 5 (it's in 1) ✓
- No eliminated letters used (G is allowed)

Therefore, the correct guess is VIGIL.

Let's try:

But V is in position 1, L in 5, and we need to place V somewhere else (since V must be in word but not position 5). This pattern misses V somewhere.
