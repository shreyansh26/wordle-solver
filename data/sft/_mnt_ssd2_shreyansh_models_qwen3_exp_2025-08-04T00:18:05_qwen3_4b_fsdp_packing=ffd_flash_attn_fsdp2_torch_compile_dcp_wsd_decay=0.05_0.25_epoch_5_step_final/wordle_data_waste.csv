### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common ending letter
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

From the new feedback on STARE:

- S is still in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- T is now wrong-positioned (-) – but we already knew T was in the 4th position from SLATE, so this simply confirms T is NOT in 4th place (contradicting earlier feedback).  
  Wait: the feedback for STARE shows T(-), meaning T is in the word but NOT in position 2. But from SLATE we had T(✓) in position 4.  
  This is impossible unless the feedback system is mis-typed. Re-reading carefully:  
  SLATE feedback: T(✓) means T is in the word AND in position 4.  
  STARE feedback: T(-) means T is in the word BUT NOT in position 2.  
  These two facts are compatible: T is in position 4, so it cannot be in position 2.

Continuing:

- A is still in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- R is not in the word (x)  
- E is in the correct position (✓), so position 5 is E.

So far we know:
Letters in the word: S, A, T, E  
Letters ruled out: L, R  
Positions fixed:  
- Position 5 = E  
- Position 4 = T  

We still need to place S and A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, but not where they were before:  
- S cannot be 1st or 2nd (from SLATE and STARE)  
- A cannot be 3rd (from SLATE)  

Therefore:  
- S must be 3rd or 4th or 5th, but 4th and 5th are taken by T and E, so S must be 3rd.  
- A must be 1st or 2nd (cannot be 3rd, 4th, 5th because those are taken or ruled out).

So possible patterns:  
A _ S T E or _ A S T E

We need to test which vowel goes in position 1 or 2. Common remaining vowels: I, O, U.  
But we have no info on them yet. Let's pick a word that fits the pattern and tests a new consonant.

A good candidate is ""ASTE_"" but that's not a valid word. Instead, let's try ""ASTE"" plus a consonant:  
Looking at valid words: ""ASTE"" is not a word, but ""ASTE"" plus a consonant at position 1:  
We need a valid word that starts with A or another letter, has S in 3rd, T in 4th, E in 5th.

Valid words fitting _ _ S T E:  
- ""PASTE"" – but we don't know P yet.  
- ""HASTE"" – H is untested.  
- ""WASTE"" – W is untested.  

""WASTE"" is a valid word and tests W (untested) while keeping S 3rd, T 4th, E 5th. This seems best.
