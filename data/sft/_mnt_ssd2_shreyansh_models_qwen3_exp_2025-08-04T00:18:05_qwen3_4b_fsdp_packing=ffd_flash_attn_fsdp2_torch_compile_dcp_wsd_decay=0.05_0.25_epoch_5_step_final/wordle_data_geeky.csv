### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) → not in the word at all
- L (x) → not in the word at all
- A (x) → not in the word at all
- T (x) → not in the word at all
- E (-) → the letter E is in the word, but not in the 5th position

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere (but not as the last letter)
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E (but not in position 5)
2. Avoids S, L, A, T
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Let me try a word that uses E plus other common letters: ""CRONE""
- C, R, O, N, E
- E is in position 4 (not 5, so satisfies the feedback)
- Avoids S, L, A, T

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates S, L, A, T
   - Confirms E is in the word but not in position 5

2. CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates C, R, O, N
   - Confirms E is in the word but not in position 5 (again) and not in position 4

So far the word:
- Contains E (but not in positions 4 or 5, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3)
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

I need a word that:
- Uses E in position 1, 2, or 3
- Uses letters from the remaining set
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""BIDGE"" - uses B, I, D, G, E - but D is eliminated? No D is still available. But G is available. This could work.
- ""HUMID"" - uses H, U, M, I, D - but D is available, but no E. Not good.
- ""PIVOT"" - uses P, I, V, O, T - but O and T are eliminated.
- ""MIDGE"" - uses M, I, D, G, E - all letters are still possible. E is in position 5 which we know is wrong. So no.
- ""BEGUM"" - uses B, E, G, U, M - all letters still possible, E in position 2. This seems good.

""BEGUM"" uses:
- B (possible)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- G (possible)
- U (possible)
- M (possible)

And it avoids all eliminated letters.

Let’s summarize everything we now know.

1. Position 2 is definitely E.
2. The word contains G, but not in position 3 and not in position 4 (from WEDGE feedback: G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 4).
3. Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, B, U, M, W, D.

Remaining possible letters: F, H, I, K, P, V, Y, plus G and the second E (since we saw E(-) in position 5, E is also in position 5).

So the pattern is:  
_ E _ E _  (with G somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5)

But G cannot be in position 3 (from BEGUM) and cannot be in position 4 (from WEDGE), so G must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible words:

- G E _ E _ : e.g., G E N E R (but N is out), G E R E N (N out), G E T E R (T out), G E P E R (invalid), G E V E R (invalid), G E F E R (invalid)
- _ E _ E G : e.g., F E T E G (T out), H E X E G (X not eliminated yet but word invalid), P I E E G (invalid), V I E E G (invalid), F I E E G (invalid), H I E E G (invalid)

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit _ E _ E G or G E _ E _:

Valid words:
- G E N E R → N out
- G E R A N → A out
- G E T A L → T, A, L out
- H E X E D → D out
- P I E C E → C out
- V I E T N → T, N out
- P I E T A → T, A out
- F I E F Y → Y allowed, but word is FIEFY (valid)
- P I E V E → V allowed, but word is PIEVE (invalid)
- H I E R E → R out
- P I E G E → G in position 4 is invalid (from WEDGE)
- V I E G E → G in position 4 invalid
- F I E G E → G in position 4 invalid
- G E P E T → T out
- G E V E R → R out
- G E F E T → T out
- G E P E G → valid word GEPET? No
- G E V E G → valid word GEVEG? No
- G E F E G → valid word GEFEG? No

Actually, let’s think more systematically:

Pattern: _ E _ E _ or G E _ E _

From G E _ E _:
- G E _ E _ : third letter can be any remaining (F, H, I, K, P, V, Y), fifth letter must be from remaining.

Possible words:
- G E F E _ → GEFED (invalid), GEFEL (invalid), GEFET (T out)
- G E H E _ → GHEED (invalid)
- G E I E _ → GIREE (invalid)
- G E K E _ → GEEKY (Y allowed) → GEEKY (valid word)
- G E P E _ → GEPED (invalid)
- G E V E _ → GEVER (invalid)
- G E W E _ → W eliminated
- G E Y E _ → GEYED (invalid)

From _ E _ E G:
- F E _ E G : second E, G in position 5
  - F E _ E G → FEIEG (invalid), FEPEG (invalid), FEVEG (invalid), FEKEG (invalid)
- H E _ E G → HEIEG (invalid)
- I E _ E G → IEIEG (invalid)
- K E _ E G → KEIEG (invalid)
- P E _ E G → PEIEG (invalid)
- V E _ E G → VEIEG (invalid)
- Y E _ E G → YEIEG (invalid)

The only valid word that fits all constraints is GEEKY (G E E K Y).

Let’s verify:
- G is in position 1 (allowed, since G must be in 1 or 5)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- K and Y are still allowed
- No eliminated letters

GEEKY seems to be the only valid candidate left.

<guess>GEEKY</guess>",GEEKY,"Let’s summarize everything we now know.

1. Position 2 is definitely E.
2. The word contains G, but not in position 3 and not in position 4 (from WEDGE feedback: G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 4).
3. Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, B, U, M, W, D.

Remaining possible letters: F, H, I, K, P, V, Y, plus G and the second E (since we saw E(-) in position 5, E is also in position 5).

So the pattern is:  
_ E _ E _  (with G somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5)

But G cannot be in position 3 (from BEGUM) and cannot be in position 4 (from WEDGE), so G must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible words:

- G E _ E _ : e.g., G E N E R (but N is out), G E R E N (N out), G E T E R (T out), G E P E R (invalid), G E V E R (invalid), G E F E R (invalid)
- _ E _ E G : e.g., F E T E G (T out), H E X E G (X not eliminated yet but word invalid), P I E E G (invalid), V I E E G (invalid), F I E E G (invalid), H I E E G (invalid)

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit _ E _ E G or G E _ E _:

Valid words:
- G E N E R → N out
- G E R A N → A out
- G E T A L → T, A, L out
- H E X E D → D out
- P I E C E → C out
- V I E T N → T, N out
- P I E T A → T, A out
- F I E F Y → Y allowed, but word is FIEFY (valid)
- P I E V E → V allowed, but word is PIEVE (invalid)
- H I E R E → R out
- P I E G E → G in position 4 is invalid (from WEDGE)
- V I E G E → G in position 4 invalid
- F I E G E → G in position 4 invalid
- G E P E T → T out
- G E V E R → R out
- G E F E T → T out
- G E P E G → valid word GEPET? No
- G E V E G → valid word GEVEG? No
- G E F E G → valid word GEFEG? No

Actually, let’s think more systematically:

Pattern: _ E _ E _ or G E _ E _

From G E _ E _:
- G E _ E _ : third letter can be any remaining (F, H, I, K, P, V, Y), fifth letter must be from remaining.

Possible words:
- G E F E _ → GEFED (invalid), GEFEL (invalid), GEFET (T out)
- G E H E _ → GHEED (invalid)
- G E I E _ → GIREE (invalid)
- G E K E _ → GEEKY (Y allowed) → GEEKY (valid word)
- G E P E _ → GEPED (invalid)
- G E V E _ → GEVER (invalid)
- G E W E _ → W eliminated
- G E Y E _ → GEYED (invalid)

From _ E _ E G:
- F E _ E G : second E, G in position 5
  - F E _ E G → FEIEG (invalid), FEPEG (invalid), FEVEG (invalid), FEKEG (invalid)
- H E _ E G → HEIEG (invalid)
- I E _ E G → IEIEG (invalid)
- K E _ E G → KEIEG (invalid)
- P E _ E G → PEIEG (invalid)
- V E _ E G → VEIEG (invalid)
- Y E _ E G → YEIEG (invalid)

The only valid word that fits all constraints is GEEKY (G E E K Y).

Let’s verify:
- G is in position 1 (allowed, since G must be in 1 or 5)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- K and Y are still allowed
- No eliminated letters

GEEKY seems to be the only valid candidate left.",Guess 5: GEEKY -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) E(✓) E(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
