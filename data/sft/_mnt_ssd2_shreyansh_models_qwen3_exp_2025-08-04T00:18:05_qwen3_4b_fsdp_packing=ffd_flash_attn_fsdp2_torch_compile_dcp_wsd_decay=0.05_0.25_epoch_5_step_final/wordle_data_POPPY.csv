### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly narrow down the possibilities based on which letters are in the word and their positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That means we can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses entirely different letters (none of S, L, A, T, E).
2. Contains common letters that are still in play (R, N, I, O, U, D, etc.).
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

A good strategic choice is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible letters.
- It covers vowels (O, U) and common consonants (R, N, D).
- It’s a valid word.

This should give us more information to narrow down the remaining letters.

2. No other letters from the eliminated set (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly narrow down the possibilities based on which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That means we can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses entirely different letters (none of S, L, A, T, E).
2. Contains common letters that are still in play (R, N, I, O, U, D, etc.).
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

A good strategic choice is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible letters.
- It covers vowels (O, U) and common consonants (R, N, D).
- It’s a valid word.

This should give us more information to narrow down the remaining letters.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- The only letter we know IS in the word and in the correct position is O at position 2 ( _ O _ _ _ )

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. O as the second letter.
2. No other letters from the eliminated set (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D).

Remaining common letters still in play: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for words with pattern _ O _ _ _ using these remaining letters:
- Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
- Possible third/fourth/fifth letters: same set, but must form valid English words.

Some candidate words:
- BOGGY
- COFFY (not valid)
- FOULY (contains U, eliminated)
- GOOFY
- HOAGY
- JOCKY
- KOHLS (contains L, eliminated)
- MOCHY
- POKEY
- WOOZY

Among these, ""BOGGY"" seems valid and uses only remaining letters:
- B, O, G, G, Y
- No eliminated letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly narrow down the possibilities based on which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That means we can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses entirely different letters (none of S, L, A, T, E).
2. Contains common letters that are still in play (R, N, I, O, U, D, etc.).
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

A good strategic choice is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible letters.
- It covers vowels (O, U) and common consonants (R, N, D).
- It’s a valid word.

This should give us more information to narrow down the remaining letters.

So far we know:

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. O as the second letter.
2. No other letters from the eliminated set (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D).

Remaining common letters still in play: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for words with pattern _ O _ _ _ using these remaining letters:
- Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
- Possible third/fourth/fifth letters: same set, but must form valid English words.

- GOOFY

- JOCKY
- KOHLS (contains L, eliminated)

S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, B, G

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- O is in position 2 ( _ O _ _ _ )  
- Y is in position 5 ( _ O _ _ Y )

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y  
Allowed letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
C, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus O and Y already placed)

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ O _ _ Y using only these letters.

Possible candidates:  
- COFFY – invalid (no such word)  
- FOULY – invalid (U eliminated)  
- HOAGY – invalid (A eliminated)  
- JOCKY – invalid (C, K allowed, but let’s check)  
- KOHLS – invalid (L, S eliminated)  
- MOCHY – invalid (C, H allowed, but verify)  
- POKEY – invalid (K, E eliminated)  
- WOOZY – invalid (W, Z allowed, but double O issue)  

Valid word that fits:  
- JOCKY – letters J, O, C, K, Y – none of the eliminated letters appear.  
  Pattern: J O C K Y → _ O _ _ Y matches.

Let’s confirm:  
J – allowed  
O – correct position  
C – allowed  
K – allowed  
Y – correct position  

No conflicts. JOCKY is a valid 5-letter English word.

  Pattern: F O M M Y → _ O _ _ Y matches.

Check each letter:
