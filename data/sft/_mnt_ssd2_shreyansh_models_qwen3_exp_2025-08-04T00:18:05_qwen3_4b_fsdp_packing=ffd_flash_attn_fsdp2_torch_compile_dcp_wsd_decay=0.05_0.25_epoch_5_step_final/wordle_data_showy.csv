For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses U which is less common
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency remaining letters while avoiding the excluded ones.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. The word starts with SHO (positions 1-3 all ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, R, N, C, K.
3. Therefore the last two letters must come from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that begins with SHO and ends with any two letters from the allowed set. The most common endings for “SHO-” are:

- SHOUT (but T is excluded)
- SHOGE (but E is excluded)
- SHOGG (but G is allowed, double G is possible)
- SHOOP (but P is allowed, double O is possible)
- SHOUL (but L is excluded)

Looking at the allowed letters, “SHOGG” and “SHOOP” are possibilities. Between them, “SHOGG” uses G twice, which is acceptable in Wordle. However, “SHOOP” is also a valid word. 

Another candidate is “SHOUL” but L is excluded. 

The best fit seems to be “SHOGG”. However, let me double-check if “SHOGG” is a valid English word — yes, it is (past tense of “shog” or slang for “shock”). 

But wait, we have not yet ruled out double letters. Since no feedback indicated double letters are impossible, “SHOGG” is still a contender.

However, another valid word is “SHOOP” (to hop in rhythm). Both are possible, but I’ll choose “SHOGG” as it uses two new letters (G) without any conflicts.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses U which is less common
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with S and does not contain L, A, T, or E.  
I need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, or E
- Uses only the remaining common letters (R, O, I, N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.)

Good candidate letters left: R, O, I, N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, K, B, G, H, F, V, W, X, Z, J, Q.

I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency remaining letters while avoiding the excluded ones.  
""SHORN"" is a good choice: starts with S, contains H, O, R, N — none of the forbidden letters appear.

4. It does NOT contain L, A, T, E, R, or N.

So far the pattern is:

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with SHO
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters (no L, A, T, E, R, N)
- Uses any of the still-allowed letters for the last two positions: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses U which is less common
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)

- Does NOT contain L, A, T, or E
- Uses only the remaining common letters (R, O, I, N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.)

From the three guesses we now know:

1. The word starts with SHO (positions 1-3 all ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, R, N, C, K.
3. Therefore the last two letters must come from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that begins with SHO and ends with any two letters from the allowed set. The most common endings for “SHO-” are:

- SHOUT (but T is excluded)
- SHOGE (but E is excluded)
- SHOGG (but G is allowed, double G is possible)
- SHOOP (but P is allowed, double O is possible)
- SHOUL (but L is excluded)

Looking at the allowed letters, “SHOGG” and “SHOOP” are possibilities. Between them, “SHOGG” uses G twice, which is acceptable in Wordle. However, “SHOOP” is also a valid word. 

Another candidate is “SHOUL” but L is excluded. 

The best fit seems to be “SHOGG”. However, let me double-check if “SHOGG” is a valid English word — yes, it is (past tense of “shog” or slang for “shock”). 

But wait, we have not yet ruled out double letters. Since no feedback indicated double letters are impossible, “SHOGG” is still a contender.

However, another valid word is “SHOOP” (to hop in rhythm). Both are possible, but I’ll choose “SHOGG” as it uses two new letters (G) without any conflicts.

From the four guesses we now know:

1. The word starts with SHO (positions 1-3 are all ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, R, N, C, K, G.
3. Therefore the last two letters must come from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that begins with SHO and ends with any two letters from the allowed set. The remaining common endings for “SHO-” are:

- SHOUT (T excluded)
- SHOGE (E excluded)
- SHOIP (but P is allowed, I is allowed)
- SHOUM (but U is allowed, M is allowed)
- SHOOP (P is allowed, but double O is possible)
- SHOUD (but D is allowed, U is allowed)

The most straightforward candidate is “SHOUD” (though it’s less common), or “SHOUM”. A more common word is “SHOOP”. 

Another possibility is “SHOIF” but that’s not a valid word. 

The best valid word among the possibilities is “SHOOP”.

However, let me check if “SHOOP” is allowed — yes, it is (to hop in rhythm). 

Since no other common word fits, I’ll go with “SHOOP”.

From the five guesses we now know:

1. The word starts with SHO (positions 1-3 are all ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, R, N, C, K, G, P.
3. The fourth letter is O (from SHOOP feedback: O(-) means O is in the word but in the wrong position; since position 4 was marked -, but position 3 is already ✓, this implies O must be in position 4).
4. Therefore the pattern is: S H O O _

Now we need a 5-letter word that starts with SHOO and uses only the remaining allowed letters for the last position. The remaining allowed letters (not yet excluded) are: B, D, F, I, M, U, V, W, Y.

Possible valid words:
- SHOOL (but L is excluded)
- SHOOL (invalid)
- SHOOT (T excluded)
- SHOOP (P excluded)
- SHOUG (G excluded)
- SHOUM (M is allowed, U is allowed)

""SHOUM"" is a valid word (a variant spelling of ""shone"" in some dialects, or a name). 

Another possibility is ""SHOUD"" but that's not a common word. 

The best valid word is ""SHOUM"".
