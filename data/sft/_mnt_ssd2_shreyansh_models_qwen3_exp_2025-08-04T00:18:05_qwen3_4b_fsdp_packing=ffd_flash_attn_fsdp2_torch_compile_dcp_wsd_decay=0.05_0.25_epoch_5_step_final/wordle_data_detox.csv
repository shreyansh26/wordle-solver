1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter coverage for common 5-letter words.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains both O and E (with the positional constraints above), and avoids A, R, S.

Good candidate letters to include: O, E, plus common consonants and vowels like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""O"" must appear somewhere except position 3
- ""E"" must appear somewhere except position 5
- Avoid A, R, S

Possible words: ""TONEY"" (but Y is sometimes a vowel), ""POEM"", ""COVE"", ""DOPE"", ""LOPE"", ""MODE"", etc.

""DOPE"" seems good because:
- Contains O and E
- O is in position 2 (allowed)

- Doesn't use A, R, S

The feedback on DOPE says ""Model answer is not five letters,"" which probably means I didn't format the guess correctly. I should have used the <guess> tag as instructed. Let me correct that and make sure the guess is a valid 5-letter word.

Looking back at the feedback:
- From AROSE, we know: O and E are in the word (but in wrong positions), and A, R, S are not in the word.
- From DOPE, the feedback was indicating the guess wasn't five letters, so I'll ignore the actual letters in DOPE (since the feedback was about formatting, not the content).

So the constraints are:

- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Cannot contain A, R, S (from AROSE)
- Must be a valid 5-letter word

- ""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded
- ""VOICE"" - but I is allowed, C is allowed, but V is less common

- ""COVE"" - but needs 5 letters

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DOPE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: tag as instructed. Let me correct that and make sure the guess is a valid 5-letter word.

Looking back at the feedback:
- From AROSE, we know: O and E are in the word (but in wrong positions), and A, R, S are not in the word.
- From DOPE, the feedback was indicating the guess wasn't five letters, so I'll ignore the actual letters in DOPE (since the feedback was about formatting, not the content).

So the constraints are:
- Must contain O and E
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Cannot contain A, R, S (from AROSE)
- Must be a valid 5-letter word

Good candidate words:
- ""TONEY"" (but Y is sometimes a vowel, and T is common)
- ""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded
- ""VOICE"" - but I is allowed, C is allowed, but V is less common
- ""POEM"" - but needs 5 letters
- ""COVE"" - but needs 5 letters
- ""LEMON"" - but M is allowed, L is allowed, but N is allowed
- ""OFTEN"" - but F is allowed, T is allowed, N is allowed

""LEMON"" seems good:
- Contains O (position 2) and E (position 4)
- O is not in position 3 (good)
- E is not in position 5 (good)
- Doesn't use A, R, S
- All letters are valid and common

Let me go with LEMON.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter coverage for common 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely in the word: O, E
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains both O and E (with the positional constraints above), and avoids A, R, S.

Good candidate letters to include: O, E, plus common consonants and vowels like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""O"" must appear somewhere except position 3
- ""E"" must appear somewhere except position 5
- Avoid A, R, S

Possible words: ""TONEY"" (but Y is sometimes a vowel), ""POEM"", ""COVE"", ""DOPE"", ""LOPE"", ""MODE"", etc.

""DOPE"" seems good because:
- Contains O and E
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Doesn't use A, R, S
- Uses common consonants D and P

Let me check another: ""MODE"" is similar, but ""DOPE"" has a more common letter set.

I'll go with ""DOPE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter coverage for common 5-letter words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely in the word: O, E
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains both O and E (with the positional constraints above), and avoids A, R, S.

Good candidate letters to include: O, E, plus common consonants and vowels like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""O"" must appear somewhere except position 3
- ""E"" must appear somewhere except position 5
- Avoid A, R, S

Possible words: ""TONEY"" (but Y is sometimes a vowel), ""POEM"", ""COVE"", ""DOPE"", ""LOPE"", ""MODE"", etc.

""DOPE"" seems good because:
- Contains O and E
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Doesn't use A, R, S
- Uses common consonants D and P

Let me check another: ""MODE"" is similar, but ""DOPE"" has a more common letter set.

I'll go with ""DOPE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DOPE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: tag as instructed. Let me correct that and make sure the guess is a valid 5-letter word.

Looking back at the feedback:
- From AROSE, we know: O and E are in the word (but in wrong positions), and A, R, S are not in the word.
- From DOPE, the feedback was indicating the guess wasn't five letters, so I'll ignore the actual letters in DOPE (since the feedback was about formatting, not the content).

So the constraints are:
- Must contain O and E
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Cannot contain A, R, S (from AROSE)
- Must be a valid 5-letter word

Good candidate words:
- ""TONEY"" (but Y is sometimes a vowel, and T is common)
- ""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded
- ""VOICE"" - but I is allowed, C is allowed, but V is less common
- ""POEM"" - but needs 5 letters
- ""COVE"" - but needs 5 letters
- ""LEMON"" - but M is allowed, L is allowed, but N is allowed
- ""OFTEN"" - but F is allowed, T is allowed, N is allowed

""LEMON"" seems good:
- Contains O (position 2) and E (position 4)
- O is not in position 3 (good)
- E is not in position 5 (good)
- Doesn't use A, R, S
- All letters are valid and common

Let me go with LEMON.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – O and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.  
   – A, R, S are not in the word.

2. DOING → D(✓) O(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   – D is in position 1.  
   – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I, N, G are not in the word.

3. DECOY → D(✓) E(✓) C(x) O(✓) Y(x)  
   – D is in position 1 (confirmed).  
   – E is in position 2 (confirmed).  
   – O is in position 4 (confirmed).  
   – C and Y are not in the word.

So the word has the pattern:

D E _ O _

and the missing letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, S, I, N, G, C, Y).

Possible letters left: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5.  
Possible combinations:

- Position 5: same set, different from position 3.
