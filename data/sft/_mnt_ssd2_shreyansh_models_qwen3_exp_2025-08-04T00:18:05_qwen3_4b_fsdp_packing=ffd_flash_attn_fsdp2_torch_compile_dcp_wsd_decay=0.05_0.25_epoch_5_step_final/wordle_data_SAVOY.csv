### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word starts with S (S in position 1 is always ✓).
2. The letter A is somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (it was marked “-” in both positions where it appeared, so it can only be in 2 or 5).
3. Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, H, R, K.
4. We still need to test other common consonants like N, D, G, B, M, etc.

We now want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A in either position 2 or 5
- Avoids all forbidden letters (L, T, E, H, R, K)
- Uses new letters to maximize information

A good candidate is “SNAIL”:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 5 (new position to test)
- Uses N, I, L.  L is already known to be absent, so this will help test N and I.
- Avoids all forbidden letters except L, but we already know L is out, so this is still a valid test.

However, since L is known to be absent, let’s instead try a word that keeps A in position 2 and tests new letters: “SPACE”.
But E is forbidden, so that’s out.

Next option: “STAIN” – T is forbidden.

“SWAIN” – W and N are new, A in position 3 is forbidden.

“SNARE” – R and E are forbidden.

“SNACK” – K is forbidden.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. A is now fixed in position 2.
3. Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, P, I, D.
4. We still need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) chosen from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, G, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.
5. Position 5 is still open, but since A is already in position 2, and we need a valid 5-letter word starting with SA, we can look for possibilities like:
   - S A _ _ _
   - With remaining letters avoiding the forbidden set.

Possible candidates:
- S A M B A (but A is already used in position 2, and we don't know if A is only once or twice)
- S A M P L E (but P, L, E are forbidden)
- S A U N A (A at position 5 is possible, tests U, N)
- S A M B O (but O is less common)
- S A M B Y (Y is possible)
- S A M B A (but double A might be possible)

However, ""SAMB"" is a prefix, but we need valid words. ""SANDY"" uses D (forbidden). ""SANG"" is 4 letters. ""SAN"" is 3 letters.

Looking at valid words starting with SA and avoiding forbidden letters:
- S A M B A (but is it a valid word? ""samba"" is valid, but double A might be okay)
- S A U N A (valid)
- S A M B O (not a valid word)
- S A M B Y (not valid)
- S A M B A (valid if considering ""samba"")

Between these, ""SAMB"" is not a complete word, but ""SAMB"" is part of ""SAMB A"". However, ""SAMB"" is not a word on its own.

Another approach: look for SA _ _ _ words with remaining letters.
Valid words:
- S A M B A (if allowed)
- S A U N A
- S A M P L E (invalid letters)
- S A M B O (invalid)
- S A M B Y (invalid)

""SAMBA"" is a valid word (a dance), and uses:
- S A M B A
- Letters: S, A, M, B, A
- M, B are new tests, and A is already known in position 2.

This seems the best option as it tests M and B in positions 3 and 4, and uses A again in position 5 if the word has double A.

But we need to confirm if the secret word can have double A. Since the feedback only shows A in position 2, it's possible.

Therefore, the best next guess is ""SAMB A"", but as a valid 5-letter word, ""SAMB A"" is ""SAMBA"".

However, ""SAMBA"" has A in position 5, which is allowed since we only know A is in position 2 (and possibly elsewhere).

But wait, the feedback from SAPID showed A(✓) in position 2, which means A is in position 2 and is correct. This does not necessarily mean A is only in position 2. It could have another A elsewhere.

But in Wordle-like games, typically letters are considered unique unless stated otherwise. However, the feedback does not preclude multiple A's.

But looking at the remaining letters, if we use ""SAMBA"", it would be:
S A M B A
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
With A in 2 and 5. This would test M and B.

But we need to be careful. The feedback from SAPID showed:
S(✓) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- P, I, D are not in the word (x)

This does not prevent other letters from appearing elsewhere. So ""SAMBA"" is possible.

But is ""SAMBA"" a valid word? Yes, it's a common word.

However, let's also consider ""SANDY"" but D is forbidden. ""SAUCY"" has U, C, Y - but C and Y are new, U is new.

""SAMBA"" seems better as it tests M and B.

But let's check if there's a better word. ""SANDY"" is invalid (D), ""SAUCY"" has C, U, Y. ""SAMBA"" has M, B.

Between these, ""SAMBA"" seems the most straightforward.

But let me reconsider: we have SA fixed, and need two more letters from remaining: B, C, F, G, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- S A M B A (valid)
- S A U N A (valid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. First letter must be S.
2. The word contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in position 3), and avoiding L, T, E.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.
Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 to test that possibility: S A _ _ _

Looking for common words: ""SHARK"" fits:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 2
- Avoids L, T, E
- Has H and R which are common and haven’t been tested yet

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word starts with S (S in position 1 is always ✓).
2. The letter A is somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (it was marked “-” in both positions where it appeared, so it can only be in 2 or 5).
3. Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, H, R, K.
4. We still need to test other common consonants like N, D, G, B, M, etc.

We now want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A in either position 2 or 5
- Avoids all forbidden letters (L, T, E, H, R, K)
- Uses new letters to maximize information

A good candidate is “SNAIL”:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 5 (new position to test)
- Uses N, I, L.  L is already known to be absent, so this will help test N and I.
- Avoids all forbidden letters except L, but we already know L is out, so this is still a valid test.

However, since L is known to be absent, let’s instead try a word that keeps A in position 2 and tests new letters: “SPACE”.
But E is forbidden, so that’s out.

Next option: “STAIN” – T is forbidden.

“SWAIN” – W and N are new, A in position 3 is forbidden.

“SNARE” – R and E are forbidden.

“SNACK” – K is forbidden.

“SPANK” – K and H are forbidden.

“SALTY” – L, T, Y – but L and T are forbidden.

“SAUCE” – U and C are new, E is forbidden.

“SAVVY” – V and Y, but double A is redundant.

“SAMBA” – M, B are new, A in position 3 is forbidden.

“SAINT” – T is forbidden.

“SAPID” – P, I, D are new, A in position 2.

This seems good: “SAPID” keeps A in position 2, tests P, I, D, and avoids all forbidden letters.

Let’s go with “SAPID”.

5. Position 5 is still open, but since A is already in position 2, and we need a valid 5-letter word starting with SA, we can look for possibilities like:

However, ""SAMB"" is a prefix, but we need valid words. ""SANDY"" uses D (forbidden). ""SANG"" is 4 letters. ""SAN"" is 3 letters.

- S A M B A (valid if considering ""samba"")

This does not prevent other letters from appearing elsewhere. So ""SAMBA"" is possible.

But is ""SAMBA"" a valid word? Yes, it's a common word.

However, let's also consider ""SANDY"" but D is forbidden. ""SAUCY"" has U, C, Y - but C and Y are new, U is new.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. First letter must be S.
2. The word contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in position 3), and avoiding L, T, E.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.
Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 to test that possibility: S A _ _ _

Looking for common words: ""SHARK"" fits:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 2
- Avoids L, T, E
- Has H and R which are common and haven’t been tested yet

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word starts with S (S in position 1 is always ✓).
2. The letter A is somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (it was marked “-” in both positions where it appeared, so it can only be in 2 or 5).
3. Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, H, R, K.
4. We still need to test other common consonants like N, D, G, B, M, etc.

We now want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A in either position 2 or 5
- Avoids all forbidden letters (L, T, E, H, R, K)
- Uses new letters to maximize information

A good candidate is “SNAIL”:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 5 (new position to test)
- Uses N, I, L.  L is already known to be absent, so this will help test N and I.
- Avoids all forbidden letters except L, but we already know L is out, so this is still a valid test.

However, since L is known to be absent, let’s instead try a word that keeps A in position 2 and tests new letters: “SPACE”.
But E is forbidden, so that’s out.

Next option: “STAIN” – T is forbidden.

“SWAIN” – W and N are new, A in position 3 is forbidden.

“SNARE” – R and E are forbidden.

“SNACK” – K is forbidden.

“SPANK” – K and H are forbidden.

“SALTY” – L, T, Y – but L and T are forbidden.

“SAUCE” – U and C are new, E is forbidden.

“SAVVY” – V and Y, but double A is redundant.

“SAMBA” – M, B are new, A in position 3 is forbidden.

“SAINT” – T is forbidden.

“SAPID” – P, I, D are new, A in position 2.

This seems good: “SAPID” keeps A in position 2, tests P, I, D, and avoids all forbidden letters.

Let’s go with “SAPID”.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. A is now fixed in position 2.
3. Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, P, I, D.
4. We still need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) chosen from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, G, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.
5. Position 5 is still open, but since A is already in position 2, and we need a valid 5-letter word starting with SA, we can look for possibilities like:
   - S A _ _ _
   - With remaining letters avoiding the forbidden set.

Possible candidates:
- S A M B A (but A is already used in position 2, and we don't know if A is only once or twice)
- S A M P L E (but P, L, E are forbidden)
- S A U N A (A at position 5 is possible, tests U, N)
- S A M B O (but O is less common)
- S A M B Y (Y is possible)
- S A M B A (but double A might be possible)

However, ""SAMB"" is a prefix, but we need valid words. ""SANDY"" uses D (forbidden). ""SANG"" is 4 letters. ""SAN"" is 3 letters.

Looking at valid words starting with SA and avoiding forbidden letters:
- S A M B A (but is it a valid word? ""samba"" is valid, but double A might be okay)
- S A U N A (valid)
- S A M B O (not a valid word)
- S A M B Y (not valid)
- S A M B A (valid if considering ""samba"")

Between these, ""SAMB"" is not a complete word, but ""SAMB"" is part of ""SAMB A"". However, ""SAMB"" is not a word on its own.

Another approach: look for SA _ _ _ words with remaining letters.
Valid words:
- S A M B A (if allowed)
- S A U N A
- S A M P L E (invalid letters)
- S A M B O (invalid)
- S A M B Y (invalid)

""SAMBA"" is a valid word (a dance), and uses:
- S A M B A
- Letters: S, A, M, B, A
- M, B are new tests, and A is already known in position 2.

This seems the best option as it tests M and B in positions 3 and 4, and uses A again in position 5 if the word has double A.

But we need to confirm if the secret word can have double A. Since the feedback only shows A in position 2, it's possible.

Therefore, the best next guess is ""SAMB A"", but as a valid 5-letter word, ""SAMB A"" is ""SAMBA"".

However, ""SAMBA"" has A in position 5, which is allowed since we only know A is in position 2 (and possibly elsewhere).

But wait, the feedback from SAPID showed A(✓) in position 2, which means A is in position 2 and is correct. This does not necessarily mean A is only in position 2. It could have another A elsewhere.

But in Wordle-like games, typically letters are considered unique unless stated otherwise. However, the feedback does not preclude multiple A's.

But looking at the remaining letters, if we use ""SAMBA"", it would be:
S A M B A
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
With A in 2 and 5. This would test M and B.

But we need to be careful. The feedback from SAPID showed:
S(✓) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- P, I, D are not in the word (x)

This does not prevent other letters from appearing elsewhere. So ""SAMBA"" is possible.

But is ""SAMBA"" a valid word? Yes, it's a common word.

However, let's also consider ""SANDY"" but D is forbidden. ""SAUCY"" has U, C, Y - but C and Y are new, U is new.

""SAMBA"" seems better as it tests M and B.

But let's check if there's a better word. ""SANDY"" is invalid (D), ""SAUCY"" has C, U, Y. ""SAMBA"" has M, B.

Between these, ""SAMBA"" seems the most straightforward.

But let me reconsider: we have SA fixed, and need two more letters from remaining: B, C, F, G, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- S A M B A (valid)
- S A U N A (valid)
- S A M C O (invalid)
- S A M B Y (invalid)
- S A N G A (invalid)
- S A M B O (invalid)

""SAMBA"" and ""SUNGA"" (but ""SUNGA"" is not common).

""SAMBA"" seems the best.

But let me verify ""SAMBA"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SAMBA"".Based on the feedback:
- S is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, P, I, D

We need two more letters from the remaining pool. The word ""SAMBA"" fits these constraints by introducing M and B while keeping SA in place and avoiding all forbidden letters.

The only valid word fitting the pattern S A _ _ A with the remaining letters is S A U N A.

Let's check:
- S A U N A
- Letters: S, A, U, N, A
- S is position 1 (✓)
- A is position 2 (✓)
- U and N are new letters
- Second A is allowed since we know there's another A later (from SAMBA feedback)
- All letters are allowed (none in forbidden list)

Therefore, the next guess is S A U N A.

Position 5 is still open, but since A is already in position 2, and we need a valid 5-letter word starting with SA, we can look for possibilities like:\n   - S A _ _ _\n   - With remaining letters avoiding the forbidden set.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- S A M B A (but A is already used in position 2, and we don\'t know if A is only once or twice)\n- S A M P L E (but P, L, E are forbidden)\n- S A U N A (A at position 5 is possible, tests U, N)\n- S A M B O (but O is less common)\n- S A M B Y (Y is possible)\n- S A M B A (but double A might be possible)\n\nHowever, ""SAMB"" is a prefix, but we need valid words. ""SANDY"" uses D (forbidden). ""SANG"" is 4 letters. ""SAN"" is 3 letters.\n\nLooking at valid words starting with SA and avoiding forbidden letters:\n- S A M B A (but is it a valid word? ""samba"" is valid, but double A might be okay)\n- S A U N A (valid)\n- S A M B O (not a valid word)\n- S A M B Y (not valid)\n- S A M B A (valid if considering ""samba"")\n\nBetween these, ""SAMB"" is not a complete word, but ""SAMB"" is part of ""SAMB A"". However, ""SAMB"" is not a word on its own.\n\nAnother approach: look for SA _ _ _ words with remaining letters.\nValid words:\n- S A M B A (if allowed)\n- S A U N A\n- S A M P L E (invalid letters)\n- S A M B O (invalid)\n- S A M B Y (invalid)\n\n""SAMBA"" is a valid word (a dance), and uses:\n- S A M B A\n- Letters: S, A, M, B, A\n- M, B are new tests, and A is already known in position 2.\n\nThis seems the best option as it tests M and B in positions 3 and 4, and uses A again in position 5 if the word has double A.\n\nBut we need to confirm if the secret word can have double A. Since the feedback only shows A in position 2, it\'s possible.\n\nTherefore, the best next guess is ""SAMB A"", but as a valid 5-letter word, ""SAMB A"" is ""SAMBA"".\n\nHowever, ""SAMBA"" has A in position 5, which is allowed since we only know A is in position 2 (and possibly elsewhere).\n\nBut wait, the feedback from SAPID showed A(✓) in position 2, which means A is in position 2 and is correct. This does not necessarily mean A is only in position 2. It could have another A elsewhere.\n\nBut in Wordle-like games, typically letters are considered unique unless stated otherwise. However, the feedback does not preclude multiple A\'s.\n\nBut looking at the remaining letters, if we use ""SAMBA"", it would be:\nS A M B A\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5\nWith A in 2 and 5. This would test M and B.\n\nBut we need to be careful. The feedback from SAPID showed:\nS(✓) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)\nThis means:\n- S is in position 1 (✓)\n- A is in position 2 (✓)\n- P, I, D are not in the word (x)\n\nThis does not prevent other letters from appearing elsewhere. So ""SAMBA"" is possible.\n\nBut is ""SAMBA"" a valid word? Yes, it\'s a common word.\n\nHowever, let\'s also consider ""SANDY"" but D is forbidden. ""SAUCY"" has U, C, Y - but C and Y are new, U is new.\n\n""SAMBA"" seems better as it tests M and B.\n\nBut let\'s check if there\'s a better word. ""SANDY"" is invalid (D), ""SAUCY"" has C, U, Y. ""SAMBA"" has M, B.\n\nBetween these, ""SAMBA"" seems the most straightforward.\n\nBut let me reconsider: we have SA fixed, and need two more letters from remaining: B, C, F, G, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- S A M B A (valid)\n- S A U N A (valid)\n- S A M C O (invalid)\n- S A M B Y (invalid)\n- S A N G A (invalid)\n- S A M B O (invalid)\n\n""SAMBA"" and ""SUNGA"" (but ""SUNGA"" is not common).\n\n""SAMBA"" seems the best.\n\nBut let me verify ""SAMBA"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""SAMBA"".Based on the feedback:\n- S is fixed in position 1\n- A is fixed in position 2\n- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, P, I, D\n\nWe need two more letters from the remaining pool.

From all feedback:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓ every time).
2. A is fixed in position 2 (✓ every time).
3. Forbidden letters now: L, T, E, H, R, K, P, I, D, M, B, U, N.
4. The last A (-) means there is another A later in the word, but positions 3 and 4 are already taken by letters we know are absent (from SAMBA and SAUNA).  
   - SAMBA: M(x), B(x) → positions 3,4,5 cannot be M or B.
   - SAUNA: U(x), N(x) → positions 3,4,5 cannot be U or N.
5. Remaining possible letters for positions 3,4,5: C, F, G, O, V, W, Y, plus A (which must appear once more).

The pattern is therefore: S A _ _ A (since the second A must appear and positions 3,4 cannot be any forbidden letters).

Valid 5-letter words fitting S A _ _ A with remaining letters:
- S A C A ? – no valid word
- S A G A ? – no valid word
- S A O A ? – no valid word
- S A V A ? – no valid word
- S A W A ? – no valid word
- S A Y A ? – no valid word

The only valid English word that fits S A _ _ A using the remaining letters is S A C A ? – none exist.  
However, “SAGA” is 4 letters and “SAGA A” isn’t valid.  
Rechecking: the only possible valid word left is S A C A ? – none.

But we missed S A C A ? – there is no such word.  
Re-examining the remaining letters and valid words, the only possible word left is S A C A ? – none.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations for positions 3,4 with remaining letters C, F, G, O, V, W, Y:

- S A C _ A – no valid word
- S A F _ A – no valid word
- S A G _ A – no valid word
- S A O _ A – no valid word
- S A V _ A – no valid word
- S A W _ A – no valid word
- S A Y _ A – no valid word

None of these produce valid English words.
