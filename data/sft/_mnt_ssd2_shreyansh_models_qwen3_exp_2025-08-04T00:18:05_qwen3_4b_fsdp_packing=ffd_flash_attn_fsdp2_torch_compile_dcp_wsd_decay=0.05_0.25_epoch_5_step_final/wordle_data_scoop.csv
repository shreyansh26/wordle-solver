### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T), with all letters being distinct. This should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Starts with S
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E

I need a new 5-letter word that starts with S and avoids L, A, T, E.  
I’ll look for a word with fresh letters to gather more clues.  
Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, D, P, B, M, etc.  
Good vowels to try next: O, I, U.

A strong candidate is “SHORN”:
- S stays in position 1
- H, O, R, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet
- Avoids L, A, T, E entirely

This should give useful information about four new letters.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:\n- S (very common consonant)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis gives us 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T), with all letters being distinct. This should provide good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is correct in position 1 (✓)\n- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Starts with S\n- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that starts with S and avoids L, A, T, E.  \nI’ll look for a word with fresh letters to gather more clues.  \nGood consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, D, P, B, M, etc.  \nGood vowels to try next: O, I, U.\n\nA strong candidate is “SHORN”:\n- S stays in position 1\n- H, O, R, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet\n- Avoids L, A, T, E entirely\n\nThis should give useful information about four new letters.\n\n<guess>SHORN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(x) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current constraints:\n- Word starts with S (position 1)\n- Contains O (position 3)\n- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E, H, R, N\n\nLetters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-confirmed S, O.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word pattern: S _ O _ _\n\nLooking for common words that fit:\n- S _ O _ _ with no forbidden letters.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- SPOIL – but I and L are allowed?

O(✓) O(?) K(?)\n- P, O, K are all allowed letters (not in forbidden list).\n\nThis seems like a good test of three new letters (P, O, K) while maintaining the known S and O positions.\n\nAnother good candidate is SMOKE, but E is forbidden.  \nAnother is SPOIL, but L is forbidden.  \nSPOOK seems the best available.\n\nI’ll go with SPOOK.\n\n<guess>SPOOK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: SPOOK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(-) O(✓) O(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on SPOOK:
- S(✓) – correct in position 1  
- O(✓) – correct in position 3  
- O(✓) – correct in position 4  
- P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 2  
- K(x) – K is not in the word at all  

So the pattern so far is:
S _ O O _

and the letters we now know are somewhere in the word (but not where they last appeared):
- P (must be in position 1, 4, or 5; but position 1 is S, 4 is O, so P must be in position 5)

Therefore the word must be:
S _ O O P

We still need the second letter.  
Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, H, R, N, K  
Allowed letters for the blank: any remaining consonant or vowel except those forbidden.

Viable vowels left: I, U, Y  
Viable consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ O O P:
- SCOOP – C is allowed, fits pattern S C O O P
- SMOOP – not a valid word
- SPOOP – P is already used in position 5, and double P is allowed, but let’s check validity
- STOOP – T is forbidden
- SWOOP – W is allowed

""SCOOP"" is a valid word and uses C, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
""SWOOP"" is also valid but uses W.  
Between the two, ""SCOOP"" is more common and tests C, which is still allowed.

So I’ll guess SCOOP.
