For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these, I'll pick a word that uses several of the top common letters. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O.
- S is not in the 4th position, and E is not in the 5th position.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps S and E in different positions.
- Uses only the remaining letters (no A, R, O).
- Introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try “STILE”:
- S moves to position 1 (not 4, so okay).
- E moves to position 4 (not 5, so okay).
- T, I, L are new letters that are common and help narrow down possibilities.

This should give good information about T, I, L and confirm or deny S and E in new positions.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word.
   - S and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

   - S is now confirmed in position 1.
   - I is confirmed in position 3.
   - T is not in the word.
   - L and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word looks like: S _ I _ _ (with I in position 3)
Letters we know are in the word: S, I, L, E
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T

We need to place L and E in positions 2, 4, or 5, but:
- L is not in position 4 (from stile feedback)
- E is not in position 5 (from arose feedback)

Possible positions:
- L could be in positions 2 or 5 (but not 4)
- E could be in positions 2 or 4 (but not 5)

We need to try a word that:
- Has S in position 1
- Has I in position 3
- Uses L and E in remaining positions 2/4/5, but respecting their restrictions
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, T)

Possible candidates:
- S L I E _ : but E would be in position 4 (allowed), but we need a 5th letter. The last letter would have to be from remaining letters (not A, R, O, T, S, I, L, E). Remaining common letters: N, D, H, C, etc. ""SLIEN"" is not a valid word.
- S E I L _ : but E is in position 2 (allowed), L in position 4 (but L cannot be in position 4). Invalid.
- S I L E _ : but L would be in position 3, but I is already in position 3. Invalid.
- S I E L _ : but E in position 4 (allowed), L in position 5 (allowed). Need a 5th letter. ""SIEL_"" - need a valid word. ""SIENA"" uses A (invalid). ""SIKES"" uses K (not tested yet). ""SIEGS"" uses G and S (S already used). ""SIEVS"" - not valid.
- S I _ L E : but E in position 5 is invalid.
- S I _ E L : but L in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). Need a 3rd letter. Remaining letters: N, D, H, C, etc. ""SIDEL"" - but D is in position 2, L in 5, E in 4. ""SIDEL"" is a valid word.

""SIDEL"" seems valid:
- S(1) ✓

- D is new letter (not A, R, O, T)
- E(4) - but E is allowed in position 4 (only restricted to 5)

""SIDEL"" seems valid:
- S(1) ✓
- I(3) ✓
- D is new letter (not A, R, O, T)
- E(4) - but E is allowed in position 4 (only restricted to 5)
- L(5) - allowed (only restricted to 4)

This seems like a good next guess to test D and confirm positions of E and L.

From the new feedback on “sidel” we now know:

- S is still correct in position 1 (✓).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
- D is NOT in the word (x).
- E is now correct in position 4 (✓).
- L is correct in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word looks like:  
S _ _ E L

Letters we know are in the word: S, I, E, L  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, D

The only missing letter is in position 2.  
Possible letters for position 2:  
- Must be from remaining unused common letters (no A, R, O, T, D).  
- Must be I, because all other required letters (S, E, L) are already placed, and I is the only other letter we know is in the word.

Therefore the only possible word is S I _ E L.  
The blank must be a letter we haven’t ruled out and that fits.  
Testing possible letters:  
- S I N E L → “sinel” – not a valid English word.  
- S I G E L → “sigel” – not valid.  
- S I C E L → “siced” + l – no.  
- S I V E L → “sivel” – no.  
- S I G E L – no.  
- S I M E L – no.  
- S I G E L – no.  
- S I G E L – no.  

Wait – the only valid English word that fits S _ _ E L and contains I somewhere is “sivel” (no), “sikel” (no), “sibel” (no), “siple” (no), “sipel” (no), “sikel” (no).  

But “sibel” is not valid.  

Let me re-examine: the only possible word that fits S _ _ E L with I somewhere is “sivel” (no).  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in SEL:  
- “ssel” – no.  
- “ssel” – no.

Actually, the only valid English word ending in “sel” with S at start and I somewhere is “sibel” (no).  

But “sibel” is not valid.  

Wait, let me think of all valid 5-letter words with pattern S _ _ E L:

But “sibel” is not a word.  

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be S _ _ E L and must contain I.  

Possible combinations:  
- S I _ E L – but then position 2 is I, position 3 is blank.  
  Need a letter for position 3 that is unused and valid.  

Letters used so far: S, I, E, L  
Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, D  

Remaining common letters: N, C, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, U, Y, etc.

I realize now – the word must be “sibel” (no).

Actually, the only valid word is “sibel” (no).  

But “sibel” is not valid.  

I must have made an error in assuming the word must be S _ _ E L.  

Let me re-examine: the word has S in position 1, E in position 4, L in position 5, and must contain I.  

So the pattern is S _ _ E L with I in either position 2 or 3.  

But position 2 cannot be I (from stile feedback: I was in position 2 and got (-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 2).  

Therefore I must be in position 3.  

So the pattern is S _ I E L.  

Now I need a letter for position 2 that is unused and forms a valid word.  

Letters used: S, E, L, I  
Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, D  

Possible letters for position 2: N, C, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, U, Y, etc.  

Try S N I E L – not valid.  
S C I E L – not valid.  
S H I E L – not valid.  
S M I E L – not valid.  
S G I E L – not valid.  
S B I E L – not valid.  
S F I E L – not valid.  
S K I E L – not valid.  
S P I E L – not valid.  
S U I E L – not valid.  
S Y I E L – not valid.  

But “spiel” is a valid word.  

Yes! “spiel” fits:  
- S in position 1 (✓)  
- P in position 2 (unused)  
- I in position 3 (must be, since I cannot be in 2)  
- E in position 4 (✓)  
- L in position 5 (✓)  

And P has not been tested yet.  

Therefore the next guess should be “spiel”.

Based on the latest feedback, the word must be S _ I E L (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are locked), and the only remaining letter to test is position 2. The valid word that fits is:
