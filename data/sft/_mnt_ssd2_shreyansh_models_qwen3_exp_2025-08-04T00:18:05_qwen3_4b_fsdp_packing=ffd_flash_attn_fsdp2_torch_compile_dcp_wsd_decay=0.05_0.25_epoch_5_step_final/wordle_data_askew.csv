### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Some excellent first guesses include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, RAISE, STARE, etc. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across different positions and vowels.

From the feedback on CRANE:

Current constraints after three guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, T, L, H, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, E, S  
3. Position restrictions:
   - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4
   - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5
   - S cannot be in position 1

Allowed positions:
- A: 1, 2, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4
- S: 2, 3, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, E, S exactly once each
- Places them only in allowed positions
- Uses two additional letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding all forbidden letters)

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s construct a word that fits:
- Try placing A in position 1
- Place E in position 2
- Place S in position 3 or 4 or 5
- Pick two new consonants that are allowed.

One valid word: “BASES”
- B and M are new allowed letters
- A in 1 (allowed)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters appear

Check positions:
A: ✓ (position 1)
B: new
S: ✓ (position 3)
E: ✓ (position 2)
Third letter (S) is fine.

So “BASES” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Some excellent first guesses include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, RAISE, STARE, etc. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across different positions and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, N
- Contains A and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively
- Has 5 letters total

We need a new word that:
1. Uses A and E (but not in positions 3 and 5)
2. Avoids C, R, N
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information

Possible letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and E in new positions and introduces other common letters. A good candidate is ""STEAL"":
- S, T, L are new common letters
- A is now in position 4 (was 3)
- E is now in position 2 (was 5)
- No C, R, N

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, E, S  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in position 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 4 (from STEAL)
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAL)
- S is not in position 1 (from STEAL)

So:
- A must be in position 1, 2, or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 4 or 5

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, E, S
- Places A, E, S in still-allowed positions
- Uses only letters from the known set plus any new ones (but avoids C, R, N, T, L)

Good remaining common letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A, E, S in fresh positions and adds two new common consonants.  
A promising candidate is “HEADS”:
- H and D are new letters
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

This satisfies every constraint.

Updated knowledge after four guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, T, L, H, D, B  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, E, S  
   – E is now confirmed to be in position 4 (from BASES feedback: E✓).
3. Position restrictions (from all feedback):
   - A cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5  ⇒  A must be in position 1 or 2
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5  ⇒  S must be in position 2 or 4
   - E is locked into position 4 (✓).

But position 4 is already taken by E, so S cannot also be in position 4.  
Therefore S must be in position 2.

So far we have:
- Position 4: E
- Position 2: S
- A must be in position 1 (since it cannot be 3,4,5 and 2 is taken by S).

Pattern so far: A S _ E _

We need two more letters, both from the remaining alphabet (avoiding C,R,N,T,L,H,D,B).

Remaining common letters: F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick two distinct new letters and form a valid word.  
Try A S _ E _ with K and M: “ASMEX” is invalid.  
Try “ASKED” – D is forbidden.  
Try “ASKEW” – uses W, which is allowed.

Check:
A – position 1 (allowed)
S – position 2 (required)

No forbidden letters used, and it’s a valid 5-letter word.
