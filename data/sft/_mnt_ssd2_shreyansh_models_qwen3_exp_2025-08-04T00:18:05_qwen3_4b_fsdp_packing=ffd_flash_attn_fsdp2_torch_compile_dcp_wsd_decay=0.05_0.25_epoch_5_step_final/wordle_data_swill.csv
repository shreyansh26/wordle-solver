### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses 5 distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:

I need a new 5-letter word that:

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, G, B, M, P, Y, K, F, W, V, X, Z, J, Q (but we can ignore the less common ones).

I'll pick a word with S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 and use other common letters. ""STING"" is a good choice: it has S in position 1, and uses T, I, N, G which are all common and not yet eliminated.

Let's update what we now know from all feedback:

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, Y
3. Letter I is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since it was in position 2 in ""silly"" and got ""-"", and we already know it's not in position 3 from ""sting"").
4. Letter L is confirmed in position 5 (✓ in ""silly""), so the last letter is L.
5. We still need to place I somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since positions 1 and 2 are S and _ , and position 5 is L).

Possible letters remaining (excluding banned ones): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Ends with L
- Contains I
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns: S _ I _ L or S _ _ I L

Looking at common words ending in SL:
- ""SKIL"" is not a word.
- ""SMIL"" is not a word.
- ""SHIL"" is not a word.
- ""SWIL"" is not a word.
- ""SUKIL"" is not a word.
- ""SPLIT"" is invalid (ends with T, not L).
- ""SKILL"" is invalid (two L's, but we already have L in position 5).
- ""SKILS"" is invalid (ends with S, not L).

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words starting with S and ending with L:
- ""SKULK"" - invalid (ends with K)
- ""SKIL"" - too short
- ""SMIL"" - not a word
- ""SWIL"" - not a word
- ""SUKIL"" - not a word
- ""SPLIT"" - ends with T
- ""SKILL"" - two L's, but we know only one L (position 5), so this would have L in position 4 as well, which might be allowed, but let's check if it's possible.

Actually, ""SKILL"" is a valid word:
- S(✓) K(-) I(-) L(-) L(✓)
But in this case, the feedback for ""silly"" was S(✓) I(-) L(-) L(✓) Y(x), which shows:
- L in position 4 is ""-"", meaning L is not in position 4 (but we know L is in position 5 from ""silly""), so ""SKILL"" would have L in position 5 as ✓, but position 4 would be L again, which would be ""-"", which matches the feedback (since in ""silly"", position 4 L was ""-"").

But ""SKILL"" has two L's, which is allowed since the word can have repeated letters as long as the positions match the feedback.

However, let's see if there's a better word with I in position 3 or 4.

Another approach: Since the word ends with SL, and starts with S, the pattern is S _ _ _ L. We know I must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- ""SPLIT"" - invalid (ends with T)
- ""SKINT"" - invalid (ends with T)
- ""SKULK"" - invalid (ends with K)
- ""SMITH"" - invalid (ends with H, and T is banned)
- ""SWILL"" - has W and I in position 3: S W I L L
  - Check letters: S, W, I, L, L - all allowed (W not banned)
  - Check positions: S(✓) W(-) I(-) L(-) L(✓)
  - This matches the feedback:
    - S is correct in position 1 (✓)
    - W is in word but wrong position (-)
    - I is in word but wrong position (-)
    - L in position 4 is wrong position (-)
    - L in position 5 is correct (✓)
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""SWILL"" is a valid word meaning to pour liquid quickly, and it fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- S(✓) W(-) I(-) L(-) L(✓)
This matches the feedback from ""silly"" (S(✓) I(-) L(-) L(✓) Y(x)) because:
- Y is banned, so the last letter must be L (✓)
- L in position 4 is wrong position (-)
- I is in word but not in position 2 or 3, so in ""swill"" it's in position 3 - but in ""silly"" I was in position 2 and got ""-"", so this is consistent (I is in word but position varies)
- W is a new letter to test

Thus, ""SWILL"" seems to be the correct next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with S and ends with L (positions 1 and 5 are correct).
- I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters A, R, O, E, T, N, G, Y are not in the word.

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""SWILL"":
- S(✓) W(-) I(-) L(-) L(✓)

<guess>swill</guess>",swill,"Let's update what we now know from all feedback:

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ L  (positions 1 and 5 are locked)
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, Y
3. Letter I is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since it was in position 2 in ""silly"" and got ""-"", and we already know it's not in position 3 from ""sting"").
4. Letter L is confirmed in position 5 (✓ in ""silly""), so the last letter is L.
5. We still need to place I somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since positions 1 and 2 are S and _ , and position 5 is L).

Possible letters remaining (excluding banned ones): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Ends with L
- Contains I
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns: S _ I _ L or S _ _ I L
