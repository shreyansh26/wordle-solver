For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, and L. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes very common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T and E are not in the word

So we need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Does not contain L, T, E
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3
- Common remaining letters to test: R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

Possible next guesses: 
- SCHAR (but H and R are good tests)
- SANER (but E is out)
- SNIAR (but I and N are good)
- SCARF (but F is less common)

I'll choose ""SCHAR"" to test S, H, A, R, C. This covers new common letters (H, R, C) and keeps A out of position 3.

- Contains A, but A cannot be in position 4

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, and L. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes very common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T and E are not in the word

So we need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Does not contain L, T, E
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3
- Common remaining letters to test: R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

Possible next guesses: 
- SCHAR (but H and R are good tests)
- SANER (but E is out)
- SNIAR (but I and N are good)
- SCARF (but F is less common)

I'll choose ""SCHAR"" to test S, H, A, R, C. This covers new common letters (H, R, C) and keeps A out of position 3.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

1. The word starts with S (S in position 1 is correct).
2. The word contains A, but A is not in position 4 (from SCHAR feedback: A(-)).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, C, H, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Begins with S
- Contains A, but A cannot be in position 4
- Does not contain L, T, E, C, H, R

Remaining common letters to test: D, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
S _ _ _ _
A must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s look for words that fit:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4 – but this is invalid because A is already ruled out for position 4)
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)

So viable patterns are S _ A _ _ or S A _ _ _.

Let’s brainstorm:
- S A _ _ _: SANER (but E is out), SARGE (but R is out), SACKY (but C is out), SADLY (but L is out), SAGGY (but G and Y are okay), SAGGI (but G and I are okay) – “SAGGI” is a valid word (plural of sago stick).
- S _ A _ _: SMACK (but C is out), SNACK (C is out), SPANK (but K is okay), SWANK (but W is okay), SLACK (L and C are out).

Looking at S A _ _ _ first:
- SAGGI: letters are S, A, G, G, I. None of the forbidden letters (L, T, E, C, H, R) appear, and A is in position 2 (valid).

This seems like a good next guess to test G and I while keeping A in a valid position.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, and L. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes very common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T and E are not in the word

So we need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Does not contain L, T, E
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3
- Common remaining letters to test: R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

Possible next guesses: 
- SCHAR (but H and R are good tests)
- SANER (but E is out)
- SNIAR (but I and N are good)
- SCARF (but F is less common)

I'll choose ""SCHAR"" to test S, H, A, R, C. This covers new common letters (H, R, C) and keeps A out of position 3.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCHAR -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) H(x) A(-) R(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

1. The word starts with S (S in position 1 is correct).
2. The word contains A, but A is not in position 4 (from SCHAR feedback: A(-)).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, C, H, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Begins with S
- Contains A, but A cannot be in position 4
- Does not contain L, T, E, C, H, R

Remaining common letters to test: D, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
S _ _ _ _
A must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s look for words that fit:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4 – but this is invalid because A is already ruled out for position 4)
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)

So viable patterns are S _ A _ _ or S A _ _ _.

Let’s brainstorm:
- S A _ _ _: SANER (but E is out), SARGE (but R is out), SACKY (but C is out), SADLY (but L is out), SAGGY (but G and Y are okay), SAGGI (but G and I are okay) – “SAGGI” is a valid word (plural of sago stick).
- S _ A _ _: SMACK (but C is out), SNACK (C is out), SPANK (but K is okay), SWANK (but W is okay), SLACK (L and C are out).

Looking at S A _ _ _ first:
- SAGGI: letters are S, A, G, G, I. None of the forbidden letters (L, T, E, C, H, R) appear, and A is in position 2 (valid).

This seems like a good next guess to test G and I while keeping A in a valid position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCHAR -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) H(x) A(-) R(x)
Guess 3: SAGGI -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) G(x) G(x) I(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - L, T, E are not in the word

2. SCHAR: S(✓) C(x) H(x) A(-) R(x)
   - C, H, R are not in the word
   - A is not in position 4

3. SAGGI: S(✓) A(✓) G(x) G(x) I(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2
   - G and I are not in the word

So the word looks like: S A _ _ _

Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, C, H, R, G, I

Remaining common letters to test: D, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with SA and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns: SA _ _ _

Let’s list valid words:
- SANDY (but Y is okay)
- SANER (but E is out)
- SANKY (but Y is okay, K is okay)
- SAPPY (but P and Y are okay)
- SAVVY (but V and Y are okay)
- SAWNY (but W and N are okay)

Among these, ""SANDY"" uses common letters D and N, Y. It doesn't use any forbidden letters and fits the pattern S A N D Y.

Let’s check:
- S A N D Y
- Letters: S, A, N, D, Y – none are forbidden
- A is in position 2 (confirmed)
- Starts with S (confirmed)

This seems like a good next guess.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: S A _ _ Y  (positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed)
- Letters not in the word at all: L, T, E, C, H, R, G, I, N, D
- Still-allowed letters: B, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with SA
2. Ends with Y
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set
4. Has a valid 3rd and 4th letters (must be two distinct letters from the allowed set)

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:
- B and K → SABKY (invalid, not a word)
- B and M → SABMY (invalid)
- K and M → SAKMY (invalid)
- F and K → SAFKY (invalid)
- M and K → SAMKY (invalid)
- V and K → SAVKY (invalid)
- V and M → SAVMY (invalid)
- W and K → SAWKY (valid word)

""SAWKY"" fits all constraints:
- S A W K Y
- All letters (S, A, W, K, Y) are allowed
- Matches the fixed S A _ _ Y pattern
- ""SAWKY"" is a recognized English word (meaning sly or cunning)

Let me check if there are any other valid words:
- SABBY (but B is allowed, but we already have two B's and it's not matching the pattern)
- SAFER (but E is out)
- SAGGY (but G is out)
- SALLY (but L is out)
- SAWNY (but N is out)
- SAPPY (but P is allowed, but we have P and P which seems less likely)
- SAWPY (but P is allowed, but not a common word)

""SAWKY"" appears to be the only valid word that fits all constraints.
