For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words often include:
- E (most common vowel)
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)

A good starting word should ideally have:
1. 3-4 vowels (but not too many, since vowels are common)
2. 2-3 consonants that are common in English
3. No repeating letters

Some popular starting words are: AROSE, ADIEU, IRATE, SLATE, CRANE, or AUDIO. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- All letters are among the most common in English

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Common letters we haven’t ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to form a word:
- If we place R in position 1, A could be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - R _ _ A _ : R _ _ A _ → possible words: RANCH, RAPID, RADII, etc.
- If we place A in position 2, R could be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - _ A _ R _ : _ A _ R _ → possible words: LAMAR, Damar, etc.
- If we place A in position 3, R could be in 1, 4, or 5.
  - _ _ A _ R : _ _ A _ R → possible words: CATER, LATER, etc.
- If we place A in position 4, R could be in 1, 3, or 5.
  - _ _ _ A R : _ _ _ A R → possible words: PLANT, etc.
- If we place A in position 5, R could be in 1, 3, or 4.
  - _ _ _ R A : _ _ _ R A → possible words: TRAIL, etc.

Let’s pick one of the more common words that fit: ""LATER"".
- L A T E R → but E is ruled out, so this is invalid.
Next: ""RANCH"" → R A N C H → A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed), no O, S, E.
This seems valid.

But let’s verify:
- A is in position 2 (originally in position 1) → allowed.
- R is in position 1 (originally in position 2) → allowed.
- No O, S, E → correct.
- All letters unique → correct.

   – R is now fixed in position 1.  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – N, C, H are absent.

So far the pattern is:

R A _ _ _

Letters still allowed (have not been marked x):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the already-placed R A.

We need two more distinct letters for positions 3 and 4, and a fifth letter for position 5, all from the allowed set and avoiding repeats.

Common words that fit R A _ _ _ and use only allowed letters:

- RADIO (but O is out)  
- RAPID (but P and D are allowed)  
- RAVEN (but V and N are allowed, but N is already out)  
- RAINS (but N and S are out)  
- RAGAS (but G and S are out)  
- RAKED (but K and D and E are out)  
- RAVEL (but V and L and E are out)  
- RAPID (P and D still allowed)  
- RATIO (O and T and I and O – O is out)  
- RAZOR (Z and O and R – O and R already known, O out)

Let’s pick “RAPID” because it uses common remaining letters (P, I, D) and fits the pattern R A P I D.

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 ✓ (from feedback)  
- A in position 2 ✓ (from feedback)  
- P, I, D have not been ruled out.  
- No repeats of any already-eliminated letters (O, S, E, N, C, H).

- RAZOR (Z and O and R – O and R already known, O out)

Let’s pick “RAPID” because it uses common remaining letters (P, I, D) and fits the pattern R A P I D.

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 ✓ (from feedback)  
- A in position 2 ✓ (from feedback)  
- P, I, D have not been ruled out.  
- No repeats of any already-eliminated letters (O, S, E, N, C, H).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words often include:
- E (most common vowel)
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)

A good starting word should ideally have:
1. 3-4 vowels (but not too many, since vowels are common)
2. 2-3 consonants that are common in English
3. No repeating letters

Some popular starting words are: AROSE, ADIEU, IRATE, SLATE, CRANE, or AUDIO. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- All letters are among the most common in English

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Common letters we haven’t ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to form a word:
- If we place R in position 1, A could be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - R _ _ A _ : R _ _ A _ → possible words: RANCH, RAPID, RADII, etc.
- If we place A in position 2, R could be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - _ A _ R _ : _ A _ R _ → possible words: LAMAR, Damar, etc.
- If we place A in position 3, R could be in 1, 4, or 5.
  - _ _ A _ R : _ _ A _ R → possible words: CATER, LATER, etc.
- If we place A in position 4, R could be in 1, 3, or 5.
  - _ _ _ A R : _ _ _ A R → possible words: PLANT, etc.
- If we place A in position 5, R could be in 1, 3, or 4.
  - _ _ _ R A : _ _ _ R A → possible words: TRAIL, etc.

Let’s pick one of the more common words that fit: ""LATER"".
- L A T E R → but E is ruled out, so this is invalid.
Next: ""RANCH"" → R A N C H → A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed), no O, S, E.
This seems valid.

But let’s verify:
- A is in position 2 (originally in position 1) → allowed.
- R is in position 1 (originally in position 2) → allowed.
- No O, S, E → correct.
- All letters unique → correct.

So ""RANCH"" is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) N(x) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A and R are both in the word but NOT in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
   – O, S, E are absent.

2. RANCH → R(✓) A(✓) N(x) C(x) H(x)  
   – R is now fixed in position 1.  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – N, C, H are absent.

So far the pattern is:

R A _ _ _

Letters still allowed (have not been marked x):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the already-placed R A.

We need two more distinct letters for positions 3 and 4, and a fifth letter for position 5, all from the allowed set and avoiding repeats.

Common words that fit R A _ _ _ and use only allowed letters:

- RADIO (but O is out)  
- RAPID (but P and D are allowed)  
- RAVEN (but V and N are allowed, but N is already out)  
- RAINS (but N and S are out)  
- RAGAS (but G and S are out)  
- RAKED (but K and D and E are out)  
- RAVEL (but V and L and E are out)  
- RAPID (P and D still allowed)  
- RATIO (O and T and I and O – O is out)  
- RAZOR (Z and O and R – O and R already known, O out)

Let’s pick “RAPID” because it uses common remaining letters (P, I, D) and fits the pattern R A P I D.

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 ✓ (from feedback)  
- A in position 2 ✓ (from feedback)  
- P, I, D have not been ruled out.  
- No repeats of any already-eliminated letters (O, S, E, N, C, H).

Therefore, RAPID is a valid next guess.
