### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A good starting word might be ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions. This should help me identify which of these common letters are in the word and their correct positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O, S, E: all absent.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and R.
2. Move A and R to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.).

Let's digest the new feedback on BARDC:

BARDC → B(x) A(-) R(-) D(x) C(-)

What this tells us:

1. B and D are NOT in the word (x).
2. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
3. R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
4. C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters that are in the word: A, R, C  
- A is confirmed in position 3 (from TRAIN) → A is fixed at slot 3.  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3.  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Letters ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N, B, D.

Remaining common letters we have not tried: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

R must therefore be in either position 4 or 5.  
C must therefore be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 3 is already A).

So possible placements:
- Position 3 is A.
- R is either 4 or 5.
- C is either 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 might be taken by R).

Let’s construct a word that satisfies:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A good starting word might be ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions. This should help me identify which of these common letters are in the word and their correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O, S, E: all absent.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and R.
2. Move A and R to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these is TRAIN:
- T (new letter)
- R (moved to 2nd position)
- A (moved to 3rd position)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This tests 3 new letters (T, I, N) while repositioning A and R.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are both in the word but in wrong positions.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in the 3rd position.
   - R is still in the word but not in 2nd position.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letter set so far: A, R
- A is fixed at position 3.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Still unused common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Try R in a new position (likely 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters.

A good candidate is CRAMP:
- C (new)
- R (moved to position 2)
- A (fixed at 3)
- M (new)
- P (new)

But R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CRAMP is invalid.

Next candidate: DRANK
- D (new)
- R (position 2) - invalid, same issue.

Better candidate: CARGO - but O is ruled out.

Next: CARMY
- C (new)
- A (fixed at 3)
- R (position 2) - invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A good starting word might be ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions. This should help me identify which of these common letters are in the word and their correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O, S, E: all absent.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and R.
2. Move A and R to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these is TRAIN:
- T (new letter)
- R (moved to 2nd position)
- A (moved to 3rd position)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This tests 3 new letters (T, I, N) while repositioning A and R.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are both in the word but in wrong positions.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in the 3rd position.
   - R is still in the word but not in 2nd position.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letter set so far: A, R
- A is fixed at position 3.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Still unused common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Try R in a new position (likely 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters.

A good candidate is CRAMP:
- C (new)
- R (moved to position 2)
- A (fixed at 3)
- M (new)
- P (new)

But R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CRAMP is invalid.

Next candidate: DRANK
- D (new)
- R (position 2) - invalid, same issue.

Better candidate: CARGO - but O is ruled out.

Next: CARMY
- C (new)
- A (fixed at 3)
- R (position 2) - invalid.

Let's try a word where R is in position 4: BARDC

<|im_end|>

Let's digest the new feedback on BARDC:

BARDC → B(x) A(-) R(-) D(x) C(-)

What this tells us:

1. B and D are NOT in the word (x).
2. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
3. R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
4. C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters that are in the word: A, R, C  
- A is confirmed in position 3 (from TRAIN) → A is fixed at slot 3.  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3.  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Letters ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N, B, D.

Remaining common letters we have not tried: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

R must therefore be in either position 4 or 5.  
C must therefore be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 3 is already A).

So possible placements:
- Position 3 is A.
- R is either 4 or 5.
- C is either 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 might be taken by R).

Let’s construct a word that satisfies:
- A in position 3.
- R in position 4 or 5.
- C somewhere else (1, 2, or 4/5 accordingly).
- Uses only allowed letters.

A quick candidate:  
If R is in position 4 and C is in position 1:  
C A R _ _ → need one more letter for position 5 (must be in {allowed}).  
But we need 5 letters and position 4 is R, position 3 is A, position 1 is C.  
We need two more letters: positions 2 and 5.  
Allowed letters: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A valid word: C A R V Y → but ""CARY"" is not a valid 5-letter word.  
How about C A R V A? No, A is already used.  
Maybe C A R G A? No.  
Let’s try C A R G Y → CARGY is not valid.  
Next: C A R L Y → C A R L Y is not valid.  
Wait, ""CARLY"" is not a word.  
Next: C A R V A – invalid.  
How about C A R P A – invalid.  
Let me think of real words.

Real word that fits: C A R V A – no.  
How about C A R G A – no.  
Wait, ""C A R A _"" – no.  
Let me try R in position 5 instead.

If R is in position 5, then C can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Let’s try C in position 2:  
_ C A _ R → need letters for 1 and 4.  
Allowed letters: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let me try R in position 4 and C in position 2:  
_ C A R _ → positions 1 and 5 to fill.  
Allowed letters: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.  
Valid word: P C A R Y – not valid.  
G C A R Y – not valid.  
H C A R Y – not valid.  
K C A R Y – not valid.  
L C A R Y – not valid.  
M C A R Y – not valid.  
V C A R Y – not valid.  
W C A R Y – not valid.  
F C A R Y – not valid.  
U C A R Y – not valid.  
Y C A R Y – not valid.  
This is tough.

Let me try R in position 4 and C in position 1:  
C _ A R _ → positions 2 and 5 to fill.  
Valid word: C H A R K – not valid.  
C L A R K – valid word!  
C L A R K – let's check constraints:  
Letters: C, L, A, R, K – all allowed.  
A is in position 3 – ✓.  
R is in position 4 – allowed (not ruled out).  
C is in position 1 – allowed (not ruled out in position 1).  
K is new – good for info.  
This seems valid.

From the latest feedback on CLARK:

C(✓) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x)

This tells us:

- C is in the word and in the correct position (slot 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (slot 3).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (slot 4).
- L and K are NOT in the word.

So the word structure is now:

C _ A R _

Letters we know are in the word: C, A, R  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: B, D, L, K, O, S, E, T, I, N, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y (from earlier rounds).

We still need to fill slots 2 and 5 with letters that have not been ruled out.  
Allowed remaining letters: U, (and possibly others we haven't tried yet like J, Q, X, Z, but those are rare).

Looking for 5-letter words matching C _ A R _ with valid English words:

- C U A R _ → no valid word.
- C _ A R Y → ""CARRY"" – fits!  
  Letters: C, A, R, Y – all allowed so far.

Thus, the most plausible next guess is CARRY.

2. First R is confirmed in position 4 – ✓
3. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 – (-)
4. Second R is in position 5 – but we already have R in position 4, so this implies:
   - The word does NOT have two R’s (since we only know it has one R from earlier feedback).
   - Therefore, the second R must be a mis-typed or mis-interpreted feedback; we can treat it as “R is not in position 5.”
5. Y is NOT in the word – x
