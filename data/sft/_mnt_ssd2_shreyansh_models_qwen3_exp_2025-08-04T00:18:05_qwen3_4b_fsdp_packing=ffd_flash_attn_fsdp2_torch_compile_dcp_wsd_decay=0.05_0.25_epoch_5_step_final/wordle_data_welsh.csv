### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters in 5-letter words and can provide helpful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ E _ _ _

- Allowed letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2.
- Contains S and L exactly once each.
- S in 2/3/4, L in 3/4/5, and the other two positions filled with new letters not in the forbidden set.

Possible candidates:
- If S is in position 3: _ E S _ _
  – L must then be in 4 or 5: _ E S L _ or _ E S _ L
  – Need two new letters for remaining spots.
  – Example: _ E S L _ → “RESLE” (invalid, not a word) or “PESEL” (invalid).
  – Example: “BESOM” (contains M, forbidden) or “HESLO” (O forbidden).

- If S is in position 2: _ E S _ _
  – L must be in 3/4/5: _ E S L _ or _ E S _ L
  – Example: “LESST” (T forbidden) or “PESKY” (K/Y allowed).

- If S is in position 4: _ E _ S _
  – L must be in 3 or 5: _ E L S _ or _ E _ S L
  – Example: “DELIS” (I allowed) or “FELTS” (T forbidden).

A valid word that fits: “DELIS”
- D (new), E (correct pos 2), L (allowed pos 3), I (new), S (allowed pos 4).

“HESLS” – invalid (double L).
“BESL” – too short.
“PEELS” – double E, but E is already fixed in pos 2, so invalid.

“DELIS” seems the best candidate.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters in 5-letter words and can provide helpful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Guess 2: LEMON -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S, L, E are all in the word but each is in the wrong position.
   - A and T are not in the word.

2. LEMON → L(-) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
   - E is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - L is still in the word but not in position 1 (it was in position 1 in LEMON and got (-)).
   - M, O, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ E _ _ _
- It must contain S and L exactly once each, with:
  – S not in position 1 (from SLATE) and not in position 5 (from LEMON), so S can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
  – L not in position 1 (from LEMON) and not in position 2 (from SLATE), so L can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, T, M, O, N.
- Allowed letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2.
- Contains S and L exactly once each.
- S in 2/3/4, L in 3/4/5, and the other two positions filled with new letters not in the forbidden set.

Possible candidates:
- If S is in position 3: _ E S _ _
  – L must then be in 4 or 5: _ E S L _ or _ E S _ L
  – Need two new letters for remaining spots.
  – Example: _ E S L _ → “RESLE” (invalid, not a word) or “PESEL” (invalid).
  – Example: “BESOM” (contains M, forbidden) or “HESLO” (O forbidden).

- If S is in position 2: _ E S _ _
  – L must be in 3/4/5: _ E S L _ or _ E S _ L
  – Example: “LESST” (T forbidden) or “PESKY” (K/Y allowed).

- If S is in position 4: _ E _ S _
  – L must be in 3 or 5: _ E L S _ or _ E _ S L
  – Example: “DELIS” (I allowed) or “FELTS” (T forbidden).

A valid word that fits: “DELIS”
- D (new), E (correct pos 2), L (allowed pos 3), I (new), S (allowed pos 4).
- Contains S and L, no forbidden letters, positions satisfy constraints.

Let me check another possibility: “FELTS” – but T is forbidden.
“HESLS” – invalid (double L).
“BESL” – too short.
“PEELS” – double E, but E is already fixed in pos 2, so invalid.

“DELIS” seems the best candidate.

Current known facts:

1. Pattern so far: _ E L _ _  (E is fixed at pos 2, L is fixed at pos 3)
2. Letters that must appear: S (from SLATE and DELIS feedback; S is in the word but never in the correct spot yet).
3. Forbidden letters: A, T, M, O, N, D, I  
   (from all previous feedback).

Therefore the word looks like: _ E L _ _ and must include S somewhere among the remaining blanks (positions 1, 4, or 5), with no forbidden letters.

Possible letters left (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S.

We need:
- One letter for position 1 (cannot be S, because S is not in position 1; from SLATE S(-) means S is not in position 1).
- One letter for position 4 or 5 (but S must go in one of the two remaining spots).
- The other spot will take another allowed letter.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: S in position 4 → _ E L S _
   - Position 1: any allowed letter except S, D, A, T, etc.  
   - Position 5: any allowed letter except forbidden set.

   Example real words:
   - “FELSS” – invalid (double S).
   - “BELTS” – T forbidden.
   - “GELS” – too short.
   - “WELSH” – H allowed, but 5 letters: “WELSH” has H and W, both allowed, and S in 4.  
     Check: W E L S H → fits pattern, no forbidden letters.

Case 2: S in position 5 → _ E L _ S
   - Position 1: any allowed letter.
   - Position 4: any allowed letter.

   Example:
   - “FELAS” – A forbidden.
   - “P E L K S” – not a word.
   - “C E L S S” – double S.
   - “B E L G S” – not a word.

Case 3: S in position 1 → S E L _ _
   - From SLATE feedback, S(-) means S is not in position 1. So this is invalid.

Thus the only viable path is Case 1: S in position 4.  
Best candidate: “WELSH”.

Check constraints:
- Contains S (position 4), E (pos 2), L (pos 3) – all correct positions.
- No forbidden letters (A, T, M, O, N, D, I are absent).
- Valid 5-letter word.
