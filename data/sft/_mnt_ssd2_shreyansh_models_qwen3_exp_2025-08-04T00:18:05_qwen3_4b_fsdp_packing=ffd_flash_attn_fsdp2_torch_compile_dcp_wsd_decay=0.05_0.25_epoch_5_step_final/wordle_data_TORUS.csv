For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

- R is now in position 1 (was 2, so new).
- O is now in position 2 (was 3, so new).
- S is now in position 4 (was 4, so same position—bad, because S was marked as wrong position in 4). Let me rethink.

- S in position 1 (was 4, new).
- T is new common letter.
- R in position 3 (was 2, new).

Let’s summarize what we know so far.

Letters we have tried and their status:
A, E, M – NOT in the word (x)
R, O, S, T – ARE in the word but each has been marked “-” (wrong position).

Positions ruled out:
R cannot be in column 2
O cannot be in column 3
S cannot be in column 4
T cannot be in column 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains R, O, S, T exactly once each
- avoids A, E, M
- places each of R, O, S, T in a position different from the ones already ruled out
- uses one additional new letter (from the remaining common letters: I, N, L, U, etc.)

Let’s list possible slots:
1 2 3 4 5

Forbidden positions:
R ≠ 2
O ≠ 3
S ≠ 4
T ≠ 2

We can try to place the four known letters first and see if a valid pattern emerges.

Try placing T in slot 1:
T _ _ _ _

Now R cannot be in slot 2 (already free), so R could go in 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, O cannot be in 3, so it could go in 2, 4, or 5.
S cannot be in 4, so it could go in 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s attempt:
T R _ _ _  → but R in slot 2 is forbidden, so skip.

T _ R _ _  → R in 3 is allowed.
   O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 2 or 5.
   S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 2 or 5 (but 2 might be taken by O).

Try:
T O R _ _  → R in 3 is allowed.
   S must go in 5 (cannot be in 4).
   Need a new letter for slot 4. Available letters: I, N, L, U, etc.
   “TORIS” – but S is usually not in 5 with these letters.
   “TROIS” – not a common word.

Try:
T _ _ O _  → O in 4 is allowed.
   R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 3 or 5.
   S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 2 or 3 or 5.

Let’s try:
T R S O _  → R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

T S R O _  → R in 3 is allowed, S in 2 is allowed.
   Need a new letter for slot 5. Let’s pick I: “TSROI” – not a word.

Try:
T _ S O R  → R in 5 is allowed, S in 3 is allowed.
   Need a new letter for slot 2. Let’s pick I: “TISOR” – not a word.

Try placing T in slot 3:
_ _ T _ _

Then:
R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 1, 4, 5.
O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 1, 2, 4, 5.
S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is T), so 1, 2, 5.
T is in 3, so we have:
_ _ T _ _

Let’s try:
S _ T _ _  → S in 1 is allowed.
   R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 4 or 5.
   O cannot be in 3 (already T), so O could be in 2, 4, 5.

Try:
S O T R _  → O in 2, T in 3, R in 4, S in 1.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “SOTRI” – not a word.

Try:
S T O R _  → T in 2 is forbidden (T cannot be in 2), so skip.

Try:
R S T O _  → R in 1, S in 2, T in 3, O in 4.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “RSTOI” – not a word.

Try placing T in slot 4:
_ _ _ T _

Then:
R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 1, 3, 5.
O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is T), so 1, 2, 5.
S cannot be in 4 (already T), so S could be in 1, 2, 3, 5.

Let’s try:
R _ _ T _  → R in 1 is allowed.
   S cannot be in 4 (already T), so S could be in 2 or 3 or 5.
   O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 2 or 5.

Try:
R O S T _  → O in 2, S in 3, T in 4, R in 1.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “ROSTI” – not a word.

Try:
R S O T _  → S in 2, O in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
S R O T _  → S in 1, R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
S O R T _  → O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 1.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “SORTI” – not a word.

Try placing T in slot 5:
_ _ _ _ T

Then:
R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 1, 3, 4.
O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is T), so 1, 2, 4.
S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is T), so 1, 2, 3.

Let’s try:
S O R _ T  → S in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 5.
   Need new letter for slot 4. Pick I: “SORIT” – not a word.

Try:
R O S _ T  → R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, T in 5.
   Need new letter for slot 4. Pick I: “RO SIT” → “RO SIT” → “ROSIT” – not a word.

Try:
R S O _ T  → R in 1, S in 2, O in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
O R S _ T  → O in 1, R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
O S R _ T  → O in 1, S in 2, R in 3, T in 5.
   Need new letter for slot 4. Pick I: “OSRIT” – not a word.

Try:
S R O _ T  → S in 1, R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
R _ S _ T  → R in 1, S in 3, T in 5.
   O cannot be in 3 (S is there), so O could be in 2 or 4.
   If O in 2: “R O S _ T” → “ROS_T” → “ROSET” – but E is forbidden (E was x).
   If O in 4: “R S O _ T” → same as above.

Try:
_ R S _ T  → R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
_ _ R S T  → R in 3, S in 4 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
_ S R _ T  → S in 2, R in 3, T in 5.
   O cannot be in 3 (R is there), so O could be in 1 or 4.
   If O in 1: “O S R _ T” → “OSR_T” → “OSRET” – E forbidden.
   If O in 4: “S R O _ T” → same as above.

This is getting tedious. Let’s look for a word that uses R, O, S, T plus one new letter, satisfies the position constraints, and is a real word.

Candidate words:
- “STORY” – contains S, T, O, R, Y. Let’s check positions:
  S(1) – allowed (was in 4, now 1)
  T(2) – forbidden (T cannot be in 2)
  O(3) – forbidden (O cannot be in 3)
  R(4) – allowed (was in 2, now 4)
  Y(5) – new, allowed
  → T and O in forbidden positions → reject.

- “TORUS” – contains T, O, R, U, S.
  T(1) – allowed
  O(2) – allowed (was in 3, now 2)
  R(3) – allowed (was in 2, now 3)
  U(4) – new, allowed
  S(5) – allowed (was in 4, now 5)
  → positions:
    R(3) – not forbidden
    O(2) – not forbidden
    S(5) – not forbidden
    T(1) – not forbidden
  → looks valid!

Check if “TORUS” is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

Let’s use TORUS as the next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the letters R, O, S, T are all in the word but in wrong positions, while A, E, M are not in the word. The positions ruled out are:
- R ≠ 2
- O ≠ 3
- S ≠ 4
- T ≠ 2

The word ""TORUS"" places:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed, was originally in 3)
- R in position 3 (allowed, was originally in 2)
- U is a new letter to test
- S in position 5 (allowed, was originally in 4)

This maximizes information gain by repositioning the known letters and introducing a new common letter (U).

Now R cannot be in slot 2 (already free), so R could go in 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, O cannot be in 3, so it could go in 2, 4, or 5.
S cannot be in 4, so it could go in 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s attempt:
T R _ _ _  → but R in slot 2 is forbidden, so skip.

T _ R _ _  → R in 3 is allowed.
   O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 2 or 5.
   S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 2 or 5 (but 2 might be taken by O).

Try:
T O R _ _  → R in 3 is allowed.
   S must go in 5 (cannot be in 4).
   Need a new letter for slot 4. Available letters: I, N, L, U, etc.
   “TORIS” – but S is usually not in 5 with these letters.
   “TROIS” – not a common word.

Try:
T _ _ O _  → O in 4 is allowed.
   R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 3 or 5.
   S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 2 or 3 or 5.

Let’s try:
T R S O _  → R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

T S R O _  → R in 3 is allowed, S in 2 is allowed.
   Need a new letter for slot 5. Let’s pick I: “TSROI” – not a word.

Try:
T _ S O R  → R in 5 is allowed, S in 3 is allowed.
   Need a new letter for slot 2. Let’s pick I: “TISOR” – not a word.

Try placing T in slot 3:
_ _ T _ _

Then:
R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 1, 4, 5.
O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 1, 2, 4, 5.
S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is T), so 1, 2, 5.
T is in 3, so we have:
_ _ T _ _

Let’s try:
S _ T _ _  → S in 1 is allowed.
   R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 4 or 5.
   O cannot be in 3 (already T), so O could be in 2, 4, 5.

Try:
S O T R _  → O in 2, T in 3, R in 4, S in 1.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “SOTRI” – not a word.

Try:
S T O R _  → T in 2 is forbidden (T cannot be in 2), so skip.

Try:
R S T O _  → R in 1, S in 2, T in 3, O in 4.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “RSTOI” – not a word.

Try placing T in slot 4:
_ _ _ T _

Then:
R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 1, 3, 5.
O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is T), so 1, 2, 5.
S cannot be in 4 (already T), so S could be in 1, 2, 3, 5.

Let’s try:
R _ _ T _  → R in 1 is allowed.
   S cannot be in 4 (already T), so S could be in 2 or 3 or 5.
   O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 2 or 5.

Try:
R O S T _  → O in 2, S in 3, T in 4, R in 1.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “ROSTI” – not a word.

Try:
R S O T _  → S in 2, O in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
S R O T _  → S in 1, R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
S O R T _  → O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 1.
   Need new letter for slot 5. Pick I: “SORTI” – not a word.

Try placing T in slot 5:
_ _ _ _ T

Then:
R cannot be in 2, so R could be in 1, 3, 4.
O cannot be in 3, so O could be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is T), so 1, 2, 4.
S cannot be in 4, so S could be in 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is T), so 1, 2, 3.

Let’s try:
S O R _ T  → S in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 5.
   Need new letter for slot 4. Pick I: “SORIT” – not a word.

Try:
R O S _ T  → R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, T in 5.
   Need new letter for slot 4. Pick I: “RO SIT” → “RO SIT” → “ROSIT” – not a word.

Try:
R S O _ T  → R in 1, S in 2, O in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
O R S _ T  → O in 1, R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
O S R _ T  → O in 1, S in 2, R in 3, T in 5.
   Need new letter for slot 4. Pick I: “OSRIT” – not a word.

Try:
S R O _ T  → S in 1, R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
R _ S _ T  → R in 1, S in 3, T in 5.
   O cannot be in 3 (S is there), so O could be in 2 or 4.
   If O in 2: “R O S _ T” → “ROS_T” → “ROSET” – but E is forbidden (E was x).
   If O in 4: “R S O _ T” → same as above.

Try:
_ R S _ T  → R in 2 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
_ _ R S T  → R in 3, S in 4 is forbidden, so skip.

Try:
_ S R _ T  → S in 2, R in 3, T in 5.
   O cannot be in 3 (R is there), so O could be in 1 or 4.
   If O in 1: “O S R _ T” → “OSR_T” → “OSRET” – E forbidden.
   If O in 4: “S R O _ T” → same as above.

This is getting tedious. Let’s look for a word that uses R, O, S, T plus one new letter, satisfies the position constraints, and is a real word.

Candidate words:
- “STORY” – contains S, T, O, R, Y. Let’s check positions:
  S(1) – allowed (was in 4, now 1)
  T(2) – forbidden (T cannot be in 2)
  O(3) – forbidden (O cannot be in 3)
  R(4) – allowed (was in 2, now 4)
  Y(5) – new, allowed
  → T and O in forbidden positions → reject.

- “TORUS” – contains T, O, R, U, S.
  T(1) – allowed
  O(2) – allowed (was in 3, now 2)
  R(3) – allowed (was in 2, now 3)
  U(4) – new, allowed
  S(5) – allowed (was in 4, now 5)
  → positions:
    R(3) – not forbidden
    O(2) – not forbidden
    S(5) – not forbidden
    T(1) – not forbidden
  → looks valid!

Check if “TORUS” is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

Let’s use TORUS as the next guess.Based on the feedback, the letters R, O, S, T are all in the word but in wrong positions, while A, E, M are not in the word. The positions ruled out are:
- R ≠ 2
- O ≠ 3
- S ≠ 4
- T ≠ 2

The word ""TORUS"" places:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed, was originally in 3)
- R in position 3 (allowed, was originally in 2)
- U is a new letter to test
- S in position 5 (allowed, was originally in 4)

This maximizes information gain by repositioning the known letters and introducing a new common letter (U).",Guess 3: TORUS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) U(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
