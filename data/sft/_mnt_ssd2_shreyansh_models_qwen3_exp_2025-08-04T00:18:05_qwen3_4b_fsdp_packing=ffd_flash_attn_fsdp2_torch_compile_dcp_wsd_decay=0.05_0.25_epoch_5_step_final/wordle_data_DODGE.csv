For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (very common vowel)
- N and E (also common)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the unknown word.

We know:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

We need five-letter words ending in E that avoid those four letters. Common letters left to try include S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Good candidates:
- STILE (S, T, I, L, E) – uses common consonants and a vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- ELBOW (E, L, B, O, W) – but O is a vowel we haven’t tested.
- BLEST (B, L, E, S, T) – but has two vowels (E and possibly S as vowel).

STILE seems best because it tests S, T, I, L while keeping E fixed at the end and avoiding forbidden letters.

Current known facts:
- Position 5 is E (fixed).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, L, M, U.
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
  – O is somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not position 3, since position 3 in MOUSE came back “-” meaning O is in the word but not in position 3).
  – E is in position 5 (fixed).

Allowed letters left to test (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels: only O is confirmed; no other vowels have been tested yet (A, I, U are out, E is fixed at 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (but not in position 3), and using only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- O in position 1: O _ _ _ E
- O in position 2: _ O _ _ E
- O in position 4: _ _ _ O E

Looking for real words:
- O _ _ _ E: “OVULE” (but L is forbidden) – invalid.
- _ O _ _ E: “BOGEY”, “COGEY” (C is forbidden), “FOGEY”, “HOGEY” – only “BOGEY” is valid.
- _ _ _ O E: “VOGUE” (G is allowed, V is allowed), “DOGME” (M is forbidden), “FOGIE” (I is forbidden), “POISE” (I and S are forbidden), “WOOLE” (double O, but O already confirmed once).

“VOGUE” fits all constraints:
- V, O, G, U, E.
- U is allowed because we only know O is in the word; U was in MOUSE but came back “-” (in word but wrong spot), so U is actually allowed (it was not confirmed “✓”).
Wait: in MOUSE, U came back “x”, so U is NOT in the word.  
So “VOGUE” is invalid (contains U).

Next: “FOGEY” – contains G, E, Y, F, O – all allowed.
“FOGEY” is a valid word.

Another candidate: “POGEY” – but P is allowed, but “POGEY” is rare; “FOGEY” is better.

Thus, the best next guess is “FOGEY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (very common vowel)
- N and E (also common)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the unknown word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
We know:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

We need five-letter words ending in E that avoid those four letters. Common letters left to try include S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Good candidates:
- STILE (S, T, I, L, E) – uses common consonants and a vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- ELBOW (E, L, B, O, W) – but O is a vowel we haven’t tested.
- BLEST (B, L, E, S, T) – but has two vowels (E and possibly S as vowel).

STILE seems best because it tests S, T, I, L while keeping E fixed at the end and avoiding forbidden letters.

From the two guesses we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is ✓).
2. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, L.
3. We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.  
   Remaining frequent consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y, etc.  
   Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

A good next word should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Use new letters from the allowed set.
- Be a valid 5-letter word.

Candidate: “BLOKE”  
- B, O, K are new letters.  
- L is already ruled out, so discard.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O and G, no other letters.

Possible words:
- “DOGME” – M forbidden.
- “BOGEY” – Y forbidden.
- “VOGUE” – U forbidden.
- “KOGE” – too short.
- “PAGOE” – A forbidden.

Actually, the correct word is “DOGME” but M is forbidden.  
We must have missed something.

Wait, in FOGEY, G was marked “-” (in word but not position 3), so G can be in 1,2,4.  
O was marked “-” in position 3 (MOUSE), so O can be in 1,2,4.

Let’s try pattern _ O G _ E:
- “BOGGE” – G in position 3 is allowed (not position 3 in FOGEY), but G was marked “-” in position 3 in FOGEY, meaning G is not in position 3. So G can be in 1,2,4.

Pattern _ O _ G E:
- “BOGGE” – G in position 4 is allowed.
But “BOGGE” is a valid word (variant spelling of “bough” or “boge”).

But let’s check letters: B, O, G, G, E – all allowed.

“BOGGE” fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (very common vowel)
- N and E (also common)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the unknown word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

We need five-letter words ending in E that avoid those four letters. Common letters left to try include S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Good candidates:
- STILE (S, T, I, L, E) – uses common consonants and a vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- ELBOW (E, L, B, O, W) – but O is a vowel we haven’t tested.
- BLEST (B, L, E, S, T) – but has two vowels (E and possibly S as vowel).

STILE seems best because it tests S, T, I, L while keeping E fixed at the end and avoiding forbidden letters.

From the two guesses we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is ✓).
2. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, L.
3. We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.  
   Remaining frequent consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y, etc.  
   Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

A good next word should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Use new letters from the allowed set.
- Be a valid 5-letter word.

Candidate: “BLOKE”  
- B, O, K are new letters.  
- L is already ruled out, so discard.  

Candidate: “GHOUL” → U is new vowel, but ends with L (ruled out).  

Candidate: “MOUSE”  
- M, O, U are new.  
- Ends with E (✓).  
- No forbidden letters.

MOUSE is a strong next guess.

Current known facts:
- Position 5 is E (fixed).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, L, M, U.
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
  – O is somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not position 3, since position 3 in MOUSE came back “-” meaning O is in the word but not in position 3).
  – E is in position 5 (fixed).

Allowed letters left to test (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels: only O is confirmed; no other vowels have been tested yet (A, I, U are out, E is fixed at 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (but not in position 3), and using only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- O in position 1: O _ _ _ E
- O in position 2: _ O _ _ E
- O in position 4: _ _ _ O E

Looking for real words:
- O _ _ _ E: “OVULE” (but L is forbidden) – invalid.
- _ O _ _ E: “BOGEY”, “COGEY” (C is forbidden), “FOGEY”, “HOGEY” – only “BOGEY” is valid.
- _ _ _ O E: “VOGUE” (G is allowed, V is allowed), “DOGME” (M is forbidden), “FOGIE” (I is forbidden), “POISE” (I and S are forbidden), “WOOLE” (double O, but O already confirmed once).

“VOGUE” fits all constraints:
- V, O, G, U, E.
- U is allowed because we only know O is in the word; U was in MOUSE but came back “-” (in word but wrong spot), so U is actually allowed (it was not confirmed “✓”).
Wait: in MOUSE, U came back “x”, so U is NOT in the word.  
So “VOGUE” is invalid (contains U).

Next: “FOGEY” – contains G, E, Y, F, O – all allowed.
“FOGEY” is a valid word.

Another candidate: “POGEY” – but P is allowed, but “POGEY” is rare; “FOGEY” is better.

Thus, the best next guess is “FOGEY”.

From all feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is E (fixed).
2. Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, L, M, U, F, Y.
3. Letters we know are in the word:
   - O must appear somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not position 3, because in MOUSE it was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).
   - G must appear somewhere in positions 1-4 (because in FOGEY it was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).

Possible positions:
- O can be in 1, 2, or 4.
- G can be in 1, 2, or 4 (but not the same position as O).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both O and G, with no forbidden letters.

Let’s list valid letters left: B, D, H, J, K, P, V, W, plus O and G.

Candidate words:
- O _ _ _ E: “OBGE” – invalid (not a word).
- _ O _ _ E: “GOB_” – “GOBEL” (L is forbidden), “GOBE” – no.
- _ _ O _ E: “BOGIE” (I is forbidden), “DOGIE” (I is forbidden), “POGOE” – no.
- _ _ _ O E: “BAGO” – no, needs 5 letters.

Wait, let’s think systematically:

Pattern _ _ O _ E:
- B, D, H, J, K, P, V, W can fill positions 1,2,4.
- Need a valid word with O in position 3 is forbidden, and G must appear.

Looking at dictionary:
- “DOGME” – M is forbidden.
- “VOGUE” – U is forbidden.
- “BOGEY” – Y is forbidden (already ruled out).
- “POGOE” – not a word.
- “HOAGE” – A is forbidden.
- “KOGE” – not 5 letters.

Actually, the only remaining candidate that fits is “DOGME” but M is forbidden.  
Rechecking: we missed “BOGEY” but Y is forbidden.

Next possible word: “VOGUE” is invalid due to U.

Wait, let’s list all valid letters: B, D, H, J, K, P, V, W, plus O and G.

Pattern _ O _ _ E:
- “GOB_” – nothing valid.
Pattern _ _ O _ E:
- “BAGO” – no.
Pattern _ _ _ O E:
- “PAGO” – no.

But we missed “VOGUE” – invalid due to U.

Another candidate: “KOGE” – no.

Actually, the correct word must be “DOGME” but M is forbidden.

Rechecking constraints: we must have both O and G in the word, ending with E, no forbidden letters.

The only remaining valid word is “DOGIE” but I is forbidden.

Wait, let’s list all possible:

Valid letters: B, D, H, J, K, P, V, W, O, G.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O and G, no other letters.

Possible words:
- “DOGME” – M forbidden.
- “BOGEY” – Y forbidden.
- “VOGUE” – U forbidden.
- “KOGE” – too short.
- “PAGOE” – A forbidden.

Actually, the correct word is “DOGME” but M is forbidden.  
We must have missed something.

Wait, in FOGEY, G was marked “-” (in word but not position 3), so G can be in 1,2,4.  
O was marked “-” in position 3 (MOUSE), so O can be in 1,2,4.

Let’s try pattern _ O G _ E:
- “BOGGE” – G in position 3 is allowed (not position 3 in FOGEY), but G was marked “-” in position 3 in FOGEY, meaning G is not in position 3. So G can be in 1,2,4.

Pattern _ O _ G E:
- “BOGGE” – G in position 4 is allowed.
But “BOGGE” is a valid word (variant spelling of “bough” or “boge”).

But let’s check letters: B, O, G, G, E – all allowed.

“BOGGE” fits all constraints.

Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, L, M, U, F, Y, B.

Remaining allowed letters (common ones): D, H, J, K, P, V, W.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ O _ G E using only these letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible combinations:
1. D O _ G E:  
   - D O G G E – but G is already fixed in position 4, so this would be D O _ G E.  
   - D O V G E – not a word.  
   - D O P G E – not a word.  
   - D O W G E – not a word.  

2. H O _ G E:  
   - H O G G E – H O G G E is a valid word (Scots spelling of “hogue”).  

3. K O _ G E:  
   - K O P G E – not a word.  

4. P O _ G E:  
   - P O D G E – P O D G E is a valid word (past tense of “pod”).  

5. V O _ G E:  
   - V O G E – too short.  

6. W O _ G E:  
   - W O G G E – W O G G E is a valid word (Scots for “wage”).  

Among these, the most common valid words are:  
- PODGE  
- HOGE  
- WOGGE  

“PODGE” is the most straightforward and common word fitting the pattern.",Guess 6: PODGE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓),FAIL
