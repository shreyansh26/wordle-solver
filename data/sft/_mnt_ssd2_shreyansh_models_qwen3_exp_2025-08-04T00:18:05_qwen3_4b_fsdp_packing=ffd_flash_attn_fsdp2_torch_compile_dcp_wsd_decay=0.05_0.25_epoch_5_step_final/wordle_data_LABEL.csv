### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage of possible letters and positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage of possible letters and positions.

- The word contains L and E somewhere (but not in positions 2, 4 for L; not in position 5 for E)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- At least one L and one E elsewhere (positions allowed: L can be 1,3,5; E can be 3,4)

Let’s list possible patterns:
A _ _ _ _

With remaining letters to choose from (excluding S,T,R,Y). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place L and E in valid positions. For example:
- L in position 1: L A _ _ _
- E in position 3: _ A E _ _
- E in position 4: _ A _ E _

Let’s try ""LANCE"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- N (new letter)
- C (new letter)
- E in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5 from SLATE feedback) → invalid

Next try ""LEMON"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""PLAID"":
- P, I, D are new letters
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4
- D in position 5
But we know E must be in the word somewhere, and this doesn’t include E → invalid

Next try ""CLEAN"":
- C, N are new letters
- L in position 2 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""BLEAK"":
- B, K are new letters
- L in position 2 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""ALONE"":
- A in position 1 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""EAGLE"":
- E in position 1 (but E cannot be in position 1 from EARLY feedback) → invalid

Next try ""LAKEE"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- K (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (but E is already in position 4, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed - but likely unique letters)

Wait, let's try ""LANCE"" again - E can't be in 5. How about ""LANED"":
- L in 1, A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5
This includes E in position 4 (allowed), L in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (confirmed), and new letters N, D.

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage of possible letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T
- Does contain L, A, E, but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively
- Has 5 distinct letters (no duplicates from feedback)

I need a new 5-letter word that uses L, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5) and avoids S and T.

Possible positions:
- L can be in 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
- A can be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
- E can be in 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let’s try a word that shifts these letters around. ""EARLY"" comes to mind:
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R (new letter, common)
- L in position 4 (allowed)
- Y (new letter, common)

This uses A, E, L in new positions and avoids S and T.

3. Still-allowed letters (among which we need two distinct ones for positions 3 and 5): B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form L A ? E ? that uses only these remaining letters in positions 3 and 5.

Quick scan of common words:

- L A F E ?  → already checked

Looking at the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Among these, the only common English word that fits L A ? E ? is L A M E ? or L A P E ?, but both D and R are ruled out.  The next best possibility is L A G E N or L A M E N, but N is already ruled out.

Wait - let's check L A G E ? again.  The word L A G E N is valid (Scots English variant of ""laid""), but N is ruled out.  The word L A G E ? with N ruled out leaves no clear option.

Another angle: position 5 could be B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's list all valid English words of the form L A ? E ? that use only the still-allowed letters:

- L A G E ?  → L A G E N (N ruled out)
- L A M E ?  → L A M E D (D ruled out), L A M E N (N ruled out)

- L A U E ?  → Not a word
- L A W E ?  → L A W E L (possible, but W and L allowed - L already used in position 1, so duplicate L is possible if rules allow duplicates)

The only remaining plausible word seems to be L A W E L, assuming duplicates are allowed.  If duplicates are not allowed, then we must have missed something.

Re-examining the still-allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking at these, the word L A M E ? has no valid options left.  The word L A P E ? has no valid options left.  The word L A G E ? has no valid options left.  The word L A B E ? has no valid options left.

This suggests we need to reconsider - perhaps we missed a word.

Wait - what about L A V E L?  V and L are allowed, and it's a valid English word (archaic form of ""level"").

But L is already in position 1, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed.  The feedback so far has not indicated any restriction on duplicates.

Given that, L A V E L seems like the most plausible remaining candidate.

However, let's check if there's any other word.  Another possibility is L A P E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A G E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A M E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A B E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A F E R, but R is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A H E R, but R is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A V E R, but R is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A W E L, which seems to be the only remaining valid word.

Thus, the best next guess is L A W E L.

But let's verify: L, A, W, E, L - letters used are L, A, W, E.  L is allowed to appear again if duplicates are permitted.  The word is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is L A W E L.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage of possible letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T
- Does contain L, A, E, but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively
- Has 5 distinct letters (no duplicates from feedback)

I need a new 5-letter word that uses L, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5) and avoids S and T.

Possible positions:
- L can be in 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
- A can be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
- E can be in 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let’s try a word that shifts these letters around. ""EARLY"" comes to mind:
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R (new letter, common)
- L in position 4 (allowed)
- Y (new letter, common)

This uses A, E, L in new positions and avoids S and T.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x), L(-), A(-), T(x), E(-)
   - Letters known to be absent: S, T
   - Letters known to be present but misplaced: L, A, E

2. EARLY → E(-), A(✓), R(x), L(-), Y(x)
   - Letters known to be absent: R, Y (in addition to S, T)
   - A is confirmed in position 2
   - L is still in the word but not in position 4
   - E is in the word but not in position 1

So far we know:
- Position 2 is A
- The word contains L and E somewhere (but not in positions 2, 4 for L; not in position 5 for E)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- At least one L and one E elsewhere (positions allowed: L can be 1,3,5; E can be 3,4)

Let’s list possible patterns:
A _ _ _ _

With remaining letters to choose from (excluding S,T,R,Y). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place L and E in valid positions. For example:
- L in position 1: L A _ _ _
- E in position 3: _ A E _ _
- E in position 4: _ A _ E _

Let’s try ""LANCE"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- N (new letter)
- C (new letter)
- E in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5 from SLATE feedback) → invalid

Next try ""LEMON"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""PLAID"":
- P, I, D are new letters
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4
- D in position 5
But we know E must be in the word somewhere, and this doesn’t include E → invalid

Next try ""CLEAN"":
- C, N are new letters
- L in position 2 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""BLEAK"":
- B, K are new letters
- L in position 2 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""ALONE"":
- A in position 1 → but position 2 is A → invalid

Next try ""EAGLE"":
- E in position 1 (but E cannot be in position 1 from EARLY feedback) → invalid

Next try ""LAKEE"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- K (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (but E is already in position 4, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed - but likely unique letters)

Wait, let's try ""LANCE"" again - E can't be in 5. How about ""LANED"":
- L in 1, A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5
This includes E in position 4 (allowed), L in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (confirmed), and new letters N, D.

This seems valid.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x), L(-), A(-), T(x), E(-)
   - Absent: S, T
   - Present but misplaced: L, A, E

2. EARLY → E(-), A(✓), R(x), L(-), Y(x)
   - Absent: R, Y (in addition to S, T)
   - A is fixed in position 2
   - L is still present but not in position 4
   - E is present but not in position 1

3. LANED → L(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓), D(x)
   - Absent: N, D (in addition to S, T, R, Y)
   - L is now confirmed in position 1
   - A is confirmed in position 2
   - E is confirmed in position 4

So the pattern so far is:
L A _ E _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with two distinct letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- L A B E L → but L is already used in position 1 and we don't know if duplicates are allowed
- L A P E D → D is already absent
- L A M E D → D is absent
- L A G E D → D is absent
- L A G E N → N is absent
- L A C E Y → Y is absent
- L A C E K → K is allowed, C is allowed
- L A F E R → R is absent
- L A M E R → R is absent
- L A P E R → R is absent
- L A W E L → W is allowed, L is used in position 1 - possible if duplicates allowed
- L A C E K seems valid

Among these, the only common English word that fits L A ? E ? is L A M E ? or L A P E ?, but both D and R are ruled out.  The next best possibility is L A G E N or L A M E N, but N is already ruled out.

Wait - let's check L A G E ? again.  The word L A G E N is valid (Scots English variant of ""laid""), but N is ruled out.  The word L A G E ? with N ruled out leaves no clear option.

Another angle: position 5 could be B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's list all valid English words of the form L A ? E ? that use only the still-allowed letters:

- L A G E ?  → L A G E N (N ruled out)
- L A M E ?  → L A M E D (D ruled out), L A M E N (N ruled out)
- L A B E ?  → L A B E L (L already in position 1), L A B E D (D ruled out)
- L A P E ?  → L A P E D (D ruled out), L A P E R (R ruled out)
- L A F E ?  → L A F E R (R ruled out)
- L A H E ?  → L A H E R (R ruled out)
- L A V E ?  → L A V E R (R ruled out), L A V E D (D ruled out)
- L A I E ?  → Not a word
- L A J E ?  → Not a word
- L A O E ?  → Not a word
- L A U E ?  → Not a word
- L A W E ?  → L A W E L (possible, but W and L allowed - L already used in position 1, so duplicate L is possible if rules allow duplicates)

The only remaining plausible word seems to be L A W E L, assuming duplicates are allowed.  If duplicates are not allowed, then we must have missed something.

Re-examining the still-allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking at these, the word L A M E ? has no valid options left.  The word L A P E ? has no valid options left.  The word L A G E ? has no valid options left.  The word L A B E ? has no valid options left.

This suggests we need to reconsider - perhaps we missed a word.

Wait - what about L A V E L?  V and L are allowed, and it's a valid English word (archaic form of ""level"").

But L is already in position 1, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed.  The feedback so far has not indicated any restriction on duplicates.

Given that, L A V E L seems like the most plausible remaining candidate.

However, let's check if there's any other word.  Another possibility is L A P E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A G E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A M E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A B E D, but D is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A F E R, but R is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A H E R, but R is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A V E R, but R is ruled out.

Another possibility is L A W E L, which seems to be the only remaining valid word.

Thus, the best next guess is L A W E L.

But let's verify: L, A, W, E, L - letters used are L, A, W, E.  L is allowed to appear again if duplicates are permitted.  The word is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is L A W E L.
