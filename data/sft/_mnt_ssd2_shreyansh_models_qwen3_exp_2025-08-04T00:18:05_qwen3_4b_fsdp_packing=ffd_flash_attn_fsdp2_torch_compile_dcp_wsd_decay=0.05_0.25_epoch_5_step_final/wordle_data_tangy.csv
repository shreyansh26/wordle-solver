For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most common in English. 

A strong starting word should ideally contain:
- Common vowels (E, A, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- It has good letter positioning that could quickly reveal correct placements

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A strong next guess should include A in a position other than 1, plus some of these remaining common letters.  
“UNTIL” is a good candidate:
- Uses U, N, T, I, L — all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Uses A in position 2 (but wait, UNTIL doesn’t have A).  
Let me pick a word that actually contains A but not in position 1, and avoids R, O, S, E.

“PAINT” is invalid (contains I and N, but also T and P, but it has A in position 2, and avoids R, O, S, E).  
“PLAID” has A in position 2 and avoids R, O, S, E.  
“PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D — all allowed letters.

Another good option is “VAULT” (A in position 2), but “PLAID” seems slightly better letter coverage.

I’ll go with “PLAID”.

Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A strong next guess should include A in a position other than 1, plus some of these remaining common letters.  
“UNTIL” is a good candidate:

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - A is still “-” (wrong position), but now we also know P, L, I, D are absent.
   - So far confirmed letters: A (must appear somewhere after position 1).
   - Confirmed absent letters: P, L, I, D, R, O, S, E.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (A is already known to be present; E, I, O are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain any of P, L, I, D, R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidates:
- “GAULT” – but U is rare and T is common, but G is okay.
- “CANT” – too short.
- “MOUNT” – contains O (out).
- “CHANT” – C, H, A, N, T. All letters allowed, A is in position 3. Uses C, H, N, T.

“CHANT” seems like a strong third guess because:
- It places A in position 3, which is allowed.
- It introduces C, H, N, T – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- If A is in position 3, we’ll narrow down quickly; if not, it still tests useful consonants.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):  
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, H, T

Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed presence):  
A (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3)

Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far the word must contain:
- A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- N (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Unused vowels: U (only remaining vowel left)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and N.
2. Does not use any of the eliminated letters.
3. Places A in 2/4/5 and N in 1/2/3/5 (without repeating positions already ruled out).

Candidate words that fit:
- BANAL (but L is eliminated)
- FANNY (but N repeated and Y allowed)
- GANKY (but K and Y are less common)
- MANGA (but G and M allowed, A repeated – not ideal)
- VANDAL (D eliminated)
- WANKY (K and Y)
- NABBY (B allowed, but Y allowed)

The cleanest, most common word that fits all constraints is “NABBY”:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- B, B, Y are all unused letters
- No eliminated letters appear

Let’s lock that in.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most common in English. 

A strong starting word should ideally contain:
- Common vowels (E, A, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- It has good letter positioning that could quickly reveal correct placements

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A strong next guess should include A in a position other than 1, plus some of these remaining common letters.  
“UNTIL” is a good candidate:
- Uses U, N, T, I, L — all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Uses A in position 2 (but wait, UNTIL doesn’t have A).  
Let me pick a word that actually contains A but not in position 1, and avoids R, O, S, E.

“PAINT” is invalid (contains I and N, but also T and P, but it has A in position 2, and avoids R, O, S, E).  
“PLAID” has A in position 2 and avoids R, O, S, E.  
“PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D — all allowed letters.

Another good option is “VAULT” (A in position 2), but “PLAID” seems slightly better letter coverage.

I’ll go with “PLAID”.

From the four rounds of feedback we now have:

Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓).

Confirmed letters but wrong positions:
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from earlier N(-) in positions 4 and 1, and now N(-) in 1 again).  
  Wait:  
  – Guess 3: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most common in English. 

A strong starting word should ideally contain:
- Common vowels (E, A, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- It has good letter positioning that could quickly reveal correct placements

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A strong next guess should include A in a position other than 1, plus some of these remaining common letters.  
“UNTIL” is a good candidate:
- Uses U, N, T, I, L — all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Uses A in position 2 (but wait, UNTIL doesn’t have A).  
Let me pick a word that actually contains A but not in position 1, and avoids R, O, S, E.

“PAINT” is invalid (contains I and N, but also T and P, but it has A in position 2, and avoids R, O, S, E).  
“PLAID” has A in position 2 and avoids R, O, S, E.  
“PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D — all allowed letters.

Another good option is “VAULT” (A in position 2), but “PLAID” seems slightly better letter coverage.

I’ll go with “PLAID”.

Guess 2: plaid -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - A is still “-” (wrong position), but now we also know P, L, I, D are absent.
   - So far confirmed letters: A (must appear somewhere after position 1).
   - Confirmed absent letters: P, L, I, D, R, O, S, E.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (A is already known to be present; E, I, O are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain any of P, L, I, D, R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidates:
- “GAULT” – but U is rare and T is common, but G is okay.
- “CANT” – too short.
- “MOUNT” – contains O (out).
- “CHANT” – C, H, A, N, T. All letters allowed, A is in position 3. Uses C, H, N, T.

“CHANT” seems like a strong third guess because:
- It places A in position 3, which is allowed.
- It introduces C, H, N, T – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- If A is in position 3, we’ll narrow down quickly; if not, it still tests useful consonants.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):  
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, H, T

Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed presence):  
A (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3)

Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far the word must contain:
- A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- N (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Unused vowels: U (only remaining vowel left)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and N.
2. Does not use any of the eliminated letters.
3. Places A in 2/4/5 and N in 1/2/3/5 (without repeating positions already ruled out).

Candidate words that fit:
- BANAL (but L is eliminated)
- FANNY (but N repeated and Y allowed)
- GANKY (but K and Y are less common)
- MANGA (but G and M allowed, A repeated – not ideal)
- VANDAL (D eliminated)
- WANKY (K and Y)
- NABBY (B allowed, but Y allowed)

The cleanest, most common word that fits all constraints is “NABBY”:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- B, B, Y are all unused letters
- No eliminated letters appear

Let’s lock that in.
