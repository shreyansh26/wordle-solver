For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This gives us maximum information about which of these key letters are present in the secret word.

Another strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" covers more of the top letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides broad coverage of common vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the form _ _ O _ _ and none of A, R, S, E appear anywhere.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Avoids A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is fixed).

Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is already confirmed in position 3.
- None of A, R, S, E are used.

This should tell us about P, I, N, T and confirm/deny O’s position (already known).

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word that fits _ _ O T H is ""BLOAT"" but we've ruled out A and B is still allowed. However, ""BLOAT"" has A which is ruled out. Instead, let's think of ""GLOAT"" - but A is ruled out. ""FLOAT"" - A is ruled out. ""DOUGH"" - fits _ _ O T H? No, O is position 3, so D O U G H doesn't fit. 

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O T H, so the word must be: [letter][letter]O[T][H].

Looking at possible combinations:
- B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y for both positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: ""BLOAT"" (invalid - A), ""GLOAT"" (invalid - A), ""FLOAT"" (invalid - A), ""DOUGH"" (invalid - doesn't fit _ _ O T H), ""MOTH"" is too short.

Looking at valid words: ""BLOAT"" is invalid, but ""BLOTH"" is a valid word meaning a grievous trouble, and it fits _ _ O T H? No, B L O T H - O is position 3, T is 4, H is 5. Yes, that fits! And we've ruled out B? No, B hasn't been ruled out yet. 

""BLOTH"" uses B and L which are still allowed.

Another option is ""GLOTH"" but G is allowed, L is allowed.

Between these, ""BLOTH"" seems like a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- B: not ruled out

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This gives us maximum information about which of these key letters are present in the secret word.

Another strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" covers more of the top letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides broad coverage of common vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the form _ _ O _ _ and none of A, R, S, E appear anywhere.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Avoids A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is fixed).

Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is already confirmed in position 3.
- None of A, R, S, E are used.

This should tell us about P, I, N, T and confirm/deny O’s position (already known).

Let’s pick a word that:

A good candidate is “COUTH”:
- C, H, U are new letters
- T is in position 4
- O is in position 3
- Uses no disallowed letters (A, R, S, E, P, I, N)

This tests C, H, U and confirms/denies T in position 4.

2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N
3. Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from feedback T(-)).

So T must appear in one of positions 1, 2, 4.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Places T in position 4 (middle of the word) to maximize information
- Uses other new letters (C, H, U) to test more possibilities

A good candidate is “COUTH”:
- C, H, U are new letters
- T is in position 4
- O is in position 3
- Uses no disallowed letters (A, R, S, E, P, I, N)

This tests C, H, U and confirms/denies T in position 4.

From the new feedback on COUTH:
- C is not in the word (x).
- O is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- U is not in the word (x).
- T is now confirmed in position 4 (✓).
- H is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is now: _ _ O T H

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, C, U.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word that fits _ _ O T H is ""BLOAT"" but we've ruled out A and B is still allowed. However, ""BLOAT"" has A which is ruled out. Instead, let's think of ""GLOAT"" - but A is ruled out. ""FLOAT"" - A is ruled out. ""DOUGH"" - fits _ _ O T H? No, O is position 3, so D O U G H doesn't fit. 

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O T H, so the word must be: [letter][letter]O[T][H].

Looking at possible combinations:
- B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y for both positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: ""BLOAT"" (invalid - A), ""GLOAT"" (invalid - A), ""FLOAT"" (invalid - A), ""DOUGH"" (invalid - doesn't fit _ _ O T H), ""MOTH"" is too short.

Looking at valid words: ""BLOAT"" is invalid, but ""BLOTH"" is a valid word meaning a grievous trouble, and it fits _ _ O T H? No, B L O T H - O is position 3, T is 4, H is 5. Yes, that fits! And we've ruled out B? No, B hasn't been ruled out yet. 

""BLOTH"" uses B and L which are still allowed.

Another option is ""GLOTH"" but G is allowed, L is allowed.

Between these, ""BLOTH"" seems like a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- B: not ruled out
- L: not ruled out
- O: confirmed position 3
- T: confirmed position 4
- H: confirmed position 5

This is a valid guess.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ O T H  (O, T, H locked in positions 3-5)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, C, U, B, L

Remaining possible first letters: D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y
Remaining possible second letters: same pool (since both positions are independent)

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? ? O T H.

Checking common words:
- D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y for both slots.

Possible candidates:
- D: D? O T H → ""DOOTH"" (invalid, not a word)
- F: F? O T H → ""FLOAT"" (invalid - A ruled out), ""FOOTH"" (valid word meaning edge or border of a hill)
- G: G? O T H → ""GLOAT"" (invalid - A ruled out), ""GOOTH"" (invalid)
- K: K? O T H → ""KOTH"" is 4 letters, no valid 5-letter word
- M: M? O T H → ""MOOTH"" (valid word meaning the mouth of a river)
- V: V? O T H → no common word
- W: W? O T H → no common word
- Y: Y? O T H → no common word

Best valid options: ""FOOTH"" and ""MOOTH""
Both fit the pattern and constraints. ""MOOTH"" is more common (mouth of a river), so let's choose that.
