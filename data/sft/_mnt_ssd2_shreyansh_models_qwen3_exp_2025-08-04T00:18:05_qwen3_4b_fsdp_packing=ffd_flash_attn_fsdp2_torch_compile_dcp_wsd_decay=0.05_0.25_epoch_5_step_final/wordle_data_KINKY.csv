### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess, we want a fresh set of common letters that weren’t ruled out.  
The next most frequent letters that remain available are R, O, U, I, N, C, H, M, D, G, etc.

A balanced word with 3-4 of these high-frequency remaining letters is ideal.  
Good candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K)
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)

I’ll pick ROUND because it tests five distinct, common letters that haven’t been eliminated yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess, we want a fresh set of common letters that weren’t ruled out.  
The next most frequent letters that remain available are R, O, U, I, N, C, H, M, D, G, etc.

A balanced word with 3-4 of these high-frequency remaining letters is ideal.  
Good candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K)
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)

I’ll pick ROUND because it tests five distinct, common letters that haven’t been eliminated yet.

So far we know:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D
- Only letter confirmed in the word (but in the wrong place): N
- N is somewhere in the secret word, but not in position 4 (since it showed “-” in ROUND, position 4).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter N (but not in position 4).
2. Uses none of the ruled-out letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain.

Remaining common letters: I, C, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5) and uses other common available letters.  
A good candidate is “CHIMP”:
- C, H, I, M, P are all still possible.
- P places N in position 3, which is different from the previous position 4.

Another candidate could be “PINGY” but Y is less common. “CHIMP” seems better.

So I’ll go with CHIMP.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) U(x) N(-) D(x)

So far we know:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D
- Only letter confirmed in the word (but in the wrong place): N
- N is somewhere in the secret word, but not in position 4 (since it showed “-” in ROUND, position 4).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter N (but not in position 4).
2. Uses none of the ruled-out letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain.

Remaining common letters: I, C, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5) and uses other common available letters.  
A good candidate is “CHIMP”:
- C, H, I, M, P are all still possible.
- P places N in position 3, which is different from the previous position 4.

Another candidate could be “PINGY” but Y is less common. “CHIMP” seems better.

So I’ll go with CHIMP.

Current information:
- Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, M, P
- Letters confirmed in the word but in unknown positions: N, I
- N is not in position 4 (from ROUND) and not in position 3 (from CHIMP).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from CHIMP).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both N and I.
2. Does not use any of the ruled-out letters.
3. Places N and I in positions different from their previous positions.

Remaining available letters (common ones): B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N and I.

Possible word structure:
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 4 and 3 before, and we know it's not in those positions).
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 3 before).

Let's try to form a word with N and I in new positions. One candidate is ""FINKY"":
- F, I, N, K, Y
- I is in position 2 (new position)
- N is in position 3 (new position)
- All letters are from the remaining pool.

Another candidate is ""VINYL"":
- V, I, N, Y, L
- But L was ruled out in SLATE (L(x)), so L is not available.

Next candidate: ""BINGO"" - but O, G, B are available, but O was ruled out in ROUND (O(x)).

Next: ""WINKY"" - W, I, N, K, Y - all available.

Between ""FINKY"" and ""WINKY"", both are valid. ""FINKY"" uses F, which is available, and ""WINKY"" uses W, which is also available. Both are equally valid guesses.

I'll choose ""FINKY"" as it uses F, I, N, K, Y - all still possible letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters completely ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, M, P, F
2. Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct positions:
   - I is in position 2
   - N is in position 3
   - K is in position 4
   - Y is in position 5
3. Position 1 is still unknown, but we know the word has the pattern: _ I N K Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a letter not yet ruled out and matches the pattern _ I N K Y.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not listed above)

Looking for real 5-letter words ending in INKEY:
- BINKY is not a valid word.
- GINKY is not standard.
- JINKY is valid.
- Q is unlikely in word position.
- VINKY is not standard.
- WINKY is valid.
- XINKY is not standard.
- ZINKY is not standard.

The valid options are JINKY and WINKY. Both fit the pattern and use available letters. Since both are real words, either is a correct guess. I'll choose JINKY.
