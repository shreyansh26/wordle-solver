For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to narrow down the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. But I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and E, but not R, O, or S, and places A somewhere other than position 1 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good next guesses should test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U). A word like ""LEAPT"" is invalid (not a real word). ""BEACH"" is invalid (contains H, not sure). ""PEACH"" is invalid (contains P and C). ""PLATE"" is invalid (contains P and L). ""CLEAT"" is valid but has C and L. 

A better approach is to use ""LEAPT"" is invalid, so let's think of a valid word: ""BEACH"" is invalid, ""PEACH"" is invalid, ""PLATE"" is invalid. 

Let's try ""PLATE"" - but it has P, L, A, T, E - but we don't know about P or L yet. However, we know A is in the word (position 2,3,4,5) and E is in the word (position 1,2,3,4). 

But we have no info on P or L yet. However, we know S is out, so T could be in. 

Let's go with ""PLATE"" as it tests new letters P, L, T while keeping A and E. 

Wait, but we have no info on P or L yet, but we know A and E must be present. 

But ""PLATE"" has A in position 3 and E in position 5 - but E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback). So ""PLATE"" is invalid. 

Next option: ""BEACH"" - E is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), C, H unknown. But C and H are new letters. 

But ""BEACH"" is valid. 

But we have no info on C or H yet. 

Another option: ""PEACH"" - P, C, H new letters. 

But ""PEACH"" has E in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).

This seems better as it tests C, L, T.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, C, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E, L

So the secret word must contain A, E, L exactly once each, and may not contain R, O, S, C, T.

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or 4 (from CLEAT).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from CLEAT).
- L cannot be in position 2 (from CLEAT).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Uses A, E, L once each
- Avoids R, O, S, C, T
- Places A only in positions 2, 3, 5
- Places E only in positions 1, 2, 4
- Places L only in positions 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s list possible placements:

A can be 2, 3, 5  
E can be 1, 2, 4  
L can be 1, 3, 4, 5  

We also need two more distinct letters (not R, O, S, C, T). Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, U.

A promising pattern is:
- E in 1, A in 2, L in 3 → E A L _ _  (need two more letters, but we already have 3 letters)
- Or A in 2, E in 4, L in 1 → L _ A _ E
- Or A in 3, E in 1, L in 4 → E _ _ L A

Let’s try L _ A _ E. We need the 3rd and 5th letters. From remaining allowed letters: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible valid words:
- L A A _ E → invalid (A repeated)
- L E A _ E → invalid (E repeated)
- L I A _ E → ""LIANE"" – not a common word
- L A I N E → ""LAINE"" – valid but uncommon
- L A M E _ → ""LAME"" is 4 letters
- L A P E _ → ""LAPSE"" – contains S (forbidden)
- L A V E _ → ""LAVE"" is 4 letters
- L A W E _ → ""LAWE"" is not a word
- L A M E D → ""LAMED"" – contains D, valid word, but E is in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed). Also, no forbidden letters.

""LAMED"" seems to fit all constraints:
- Letters: L, A, M, E, D
- Contains required A, E, L
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T
- Positions: A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed)

Based on the accumulated constraints, I will guess the word ""LAMED"".

- E in 1, A in 2, L in 3 → E A L _ _  (need two more letters, but we already have 3 letters)
- Or A in 2, E in 4, L in 1 → L _ A _ E
- Or A in 3, E in 1, L in 4 → E _ _ L A

Let’s try L _ A _ E. We need the 3rd and 5th letters. From remaining allowed letters: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible valid words:
- L A A _ E → invalid (A repeated)
- L E A _ E → invalid (E repeated)
- L I A _ E → ""LIANE"" – not a common word
- L A I N E → ""LAINE"" – valid but uncommon
- L A M E _ → ""LAME"" is 4 letters
- L A P E _ → ""LAPSE"" – contains S (forbidden)
- L A V E _ → ""LAVE"" is 4 letters
- L A W E _ → ""LAWE"" is not a word
- L A M E D → ""LAMED"" – contains D, valid word, but E is in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed). Also, no forbidden letters.

""LAMED"" seems to fit all constraints:
- Letters: L, A, M, E, D
- Contains required A, E, L
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T
- Positions: A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed)Based on the accumulated constraints, I will guess the word ""LAMED"".",Guess 3: LAMED -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(-) M(x) E(-) D(x),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to narrow down the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. But I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and E, but not R, O, or S, and places A somewhere other than position 1 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good next guesses should test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U). A word like ""LEAPT"" is invalid (not a real word). ""BEACH"" is invalid (contains H, not sure). ""PEACH"" is invalid (contains P and C). ""PLATE"" is invalid (contains P and L). ""CLEAT"" is valid but has C and L. 

A better approach is to use ""LEAPT"" is invalid, so let's think of a valid word: ""BEACH"" is invalid, ""PEACH"" is invalid, ""PLATE"" is invalid. 

Let's try ""PLATE"" - but it has P, L, A, T, E - but we don't know about P or L yet. However, we know A is in the word (position 2,3,4,5) and E is in the word (position 1,2,3,4). 

But we have no info on P or L yet. However, we know S is out, so T could be in. 

Let's go with ""PLATE"" as it tests new letters P, L, T while keeping A and E. 

Wait, but we have no info on P or L yet, but we know A and E must be present. 

But ""PLATE"" has A in position 3 and E in position 5 - but E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback). So ""PLATE"" is invalid. 

Next option: ""BEACH"" - E is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), C, H unknown. But C and H are new letters. 

But ""BEACH"" is valid. 

But we have no info on C or H yet. 

Another option: ""PEACH"" - P, C, H new letters. 

But ""PEACH"" has E in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). 

But we have no info on P, C, H yet. 

Let's try ""PEACH"" as it's a valid word and tests new letters. 

But wait, we have no info on P, C, H, but we know A and E must be present. 

Alternatively, ""CLEAT"" - C, L, T new letters. 

But ""CLEAT"" has E in position 4 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed). 

This seems better as it tests C, L, T. 

I think ""CLEAT"" is a good next guess.Based on the feedback that A and E are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, O, S are not in the word, I'll try ""CLEAT"" to test new consonants while keeping A and E in possible positions.

Guess 2: CLEAT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, C, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E, L

So the secret word must contain A, E, L exactly once each, and may not contain R, O, S, C, T.

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or 4 (from CLEAT).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from CLEAT).
- L cannot be in position 2 (from CLEAT).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Uses A, E, L once each
- Avoids R, O, S, C, T
- Places A only in positions 2, 3, 5
- Places E only in positions 1, 2, 4
- Places L only in positions 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s list possible placements:

A can be 2, 3, 5  
E can be 1, 2, 4  
L can be 1, 3, 4, 5  

We also need two more distinct letters (not R, O, S, C, T). Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, U.

A promising pattern is:
- E in 1, A in 2, L in 3 → E A L _ _  (need two more letters, but we already have 3 letters)
- Or A in 2, E in 4, L in 1 → L _ A _ E
- Or A in 3, E in 1, L in 4 → E _ _ L A

Let’s try L _ A _ E. We need the 3rd and 5th letters. From remaining allowed letters: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible valid words:
- L A A _ E → invalid (A repeated)
- L E A _ E → invalid (E repeated)
- L I A _ E → ""LIANE"" – not a common word
- L A I N E → ""LAINE"" – valid but uncommon
- L A M E _ → ""LAME"" is 4 letters
- L A P E _ → ""LAPSE"" – contains S (forbidden)
- L A V E _ → ""LAVE"" is 4 letters
- L A W E _ → ""LAWE"" is not a word
- L A M E D → ""LAMED"" – contains D, valid word, but E is in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed). Also, no forbidden letters.

""LAMED"" seems to fit all constraints:
- Letters: L, A, M, E, D
- Contains required A, E, L
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T
- Positions: A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed)Based on the accumulated constraints, I will guess the word ""LAMED"".

Let's try ""PLATE"" - but it has P, L, A, T, E - but we don't know about P or L yet. However, we know A is in the word (position 2,3,4,5) and E is in the word (position 1,2,3,4). 

But we have no info on P or L yet. However, we know S is out, so T could be in. 

Let's go with ""PLATE"" as it tests new letters P, L, T while keeping A and E. 

Wait, but we have no info on P or L yet, but we know A and E must be present. 

But ""PLATE"" has A in position 3 and E in position 5 - but E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback). So ""PLATE"" is invalid. 

Next option: ""BEACH"" - E is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), C, H unknown. But C and H are new letters. 

But ""BEACH"" is valid. 

But we have no info on C or H yet. 

Another option: ""PEACH"" - P, C, H new letters. 

But ""PEACH"" has E in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). 

But we have no info on P, C, H yet. 

Let's try ""PEACH"" as it's a valid word and tests new letters. 

But wait, we have no info on P, C, H, but we know A and E must be present. 

Alternatively, ""CLEAT"" - C, L, T new letters. 

But ""CLEAT"" has E in position 4 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed). 

This seems better as it tests C, L, T. 

I think ""CLEAT"" is a good next guess.Based on the feedback that A and E are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, O, S are not in the word, I'll try ""CLEAT"" to test new consonants while keeping A and E in possible positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, C, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E, L

So the secret word must contain A, E, L exactly once each, and may not contain R, O, S, C, T.

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or 4 (from CLEAT).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from CLEAT).
- L cannot be in position 2 (from CLEAT).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Uses A, E, L once each
- Avoids R, O, S, C, T
- Places A only in positions 2, 3, 5
- Places E only in positions 1, 2, 4
- Places L only in positions 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s list possible placements:

A can be 2, 3, 5  
E can be 1, 2, 4  
L can be 1, 3, 4, 5  

We also need two more distinct letters (not R, O, S, C, T). Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, U.

A promising pattern is:
- E in 1, A in 2, L in 3 → E A L _ _  (need two more letters, but we already have 3 letters)
- Or A in 2, E in 4, L in 1 → L _ A _ E
- Or A in 3, E in 1, L in 4 → E _ _ L A

Let’s try L _ A _ E. We need the 3rd and 5th letters. From remaining allowed letters: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible valid words:
- L A A _ E → invalid (A repeated)
- L E A _ E → invalid (E repeated)
- L I A _ E → ""LIANE"" – not a common word
- L A I N E → ""LAINE"" – valid but uncommon
- L A M E _ → ""LAME"" is 4 letters
- L A P E _ → ""LAPSE"" – contains S (forbidden)
- L A V E _ → ""LAVE"" is 4 letters
- L A W E _ → ""LAWE"" is not a word
- L A M E D → ""LAMED"" – contains D, valid word, but E is in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed). Also, no forbidden letters.

""LAMED"" seems to fit all constraints:
- Letters: L, A, M, E, D
- Contains required A, E, L
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T
- Positions: A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed)Based on the accumulated constraints, I will guess the word ""LAMED"".

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
1. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position:
   - L is in position 1 (✓)

2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
   - A (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4)
   - E (cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5)
   - L is already fixed at position 1, so no additional constraints from L

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, C, T, M, D

4. Positions already ruled out for A, E, L:
   - A: not 1, 2, 4 → must be 3 or 5
   - E: not 3, 4, 5 → must be 1 or 2
   - L: fixed at 1 → no restriction on other L’s (but we only have one L so far)

Current pattern: L _ _ _ _

We have two letters to place: A and E, plus two more letters (unknown, but not R, O, S, C, T, M, D).

Possible remaining letters (from consonants and vowels not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, H, I, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with:
- A must be in 3 or 5
- E must be in 1 or 2 (but 1 is L), so E must be in 2
- The other two positions must be filled with allowed letters.

So far we have: L E _ _ _

Now place A: must be 3 or 5.

Case 1: A in 3 → L E A _ _
   Then position 5 must be a letter not ruled out and not yet used.
   Possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y
   We need a valid 5-letter word: LEA__?
   Valid options: LEAFY, LEANS, LEAKY, LEAPT (invalid), LEAVE (contains E in 5 which is disallowed), LEAFS (contains S which is disallowed)
   Only LEAFY seems valid, but F and Y are allowed.

Case 2: A in 5 → L E _ _ A
   Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters.
   Possible words: L E _ _ A
   Valid options: LEWMAA (invalid), L E N _ A → L E N D A (D disallowed), L E N I A (valid word: LE N I A → ""LE NIA""? Not a word), L E W N A (invalid), L E V I A (valid word: LEVIA? Not common), L E P I A (invalid), L E W I A (invalid), L E N G A (invalid), L E P A (invalid), L E V A (invalid)

From these, only LEAFY and possibly LEWNA are candidates, but LEWNA is invalid.
LEAFY uses F and Y, neither of which is ruled out.

Another angle: A in 3 → L E A _ _
   Possible word: LEAFY (F, Y allowed)
   Check constraints:
   - L in 1 (✓)
   - E in 2 (allowed)
   - A in 3 (allowed)
   - F and Y not ruled out
   - No forbidden letters

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LEAFY.
