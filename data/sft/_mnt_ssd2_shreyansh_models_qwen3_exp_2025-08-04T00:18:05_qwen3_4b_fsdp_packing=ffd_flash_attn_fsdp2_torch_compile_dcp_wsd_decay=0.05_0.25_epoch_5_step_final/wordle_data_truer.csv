### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters in one guess, which should provide strong feedback for narrowing down the possibilities.

- L is not in the word (x)  

So the pattern is now:

And we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, C, L  
- Letters in the word: R (position 2), E (position 4), U (somewhere else, but not position 3)  

U cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in CRUEL and feedback was “-”), so U must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U R _ E _   (U in position 1)  
- _ R _ E U   (U in position 5)  

Let’s list valid letters left to use (excluding A, O, S, C, L). Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, Y (Y can act as vowel).  

Try U R _ E _ :  
- URINE – but I and N are ok, but “URINE” is 5 letters.  
- URGER – G is ok, but double G may be rare.  
- URLET – L is excluded.

- P R I E U – not a word.

- URINE – valid word. Letters: U, R, I, N, E.  
  - U: new position (1) – ok

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:

Looking for words with E in position 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _ : ERGOT (but has G and T)
- _ R E _ _ : DREEL (not valid), TREAD (but A is invalid), CREEK (but C is ok, K is ok)
- _ R _ E _ : FRERE (invalid), PRUNE (but U is ok, N is ok)
- _ R _ _ E : TRICE (but I is ok, C is ok)

A good candidate is ""TREAD"" but A is invalid. Next is ""BRIDE"" which has I and D - both valid. Another is ""CRUEL"" which has U and L - both valid. 

Let me choose ""CRUEL"" because C, R, U, E, L are all valid letters not excluded, and R is in correct position, E is present but not in position 5.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRUEL:

- C is not in the word (x)  
- R is in the correct 2nd position (✓) – already known  
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- E is in the correct 4th position (✓)  
- L is not in the word (x)  

So the pattern is now:  
_ R _ E _  

And we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, C, L  
- Letters in the word: R (position 2), E (position 4), U (somewhere else, but not position 3)  

U cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in CRUEL and feedback was “-”), so U must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U R _ E _   (U in position 1)  
- _ R _ E U   (U in position 5)  

Let’s list valid letters left to use (excluding A, O, S, C, L). Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, Y (Y can act as vowel).  

Try U R _ E _ :  
- URINE – but I and N are ok, but “URINE” is 5 letters.  
- URGER – G is ok, but double G may be rare.  
- URLET – L is excluded.  

Try _ R _ E U :  
- D R I E U – not a word.  
- P R I E U – not a word.  
- T R I E U – not a word.  
- N R I E U – not a word.  
- D R U E U – not valid.  

Another angle: U must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1 and 5. Let’s try U in 1: UR…E…  
- URINE – valid word. Letters: U, R, I, N, E.  
  - U: new position (1) – ok  
  - R: position 2 – correct  
  - I: new letter, not excluded  
  - N: new letter, not excluded  
  - E: position 4 – correct  

No conflicts. URINE seems like the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Known positions  
   - 2nd letter = R (✓ from all guesses)

2. Known letters that are somewhere in the word  
   - E (✓ in 4th position from CRUEL)  
   - U (✓ from CRUEL, but wrong position in CRUEL and URINE)  

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N

4. Positions ruled out for U and E  
   - U cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was tried in 3 and 5 and got “-” both times; in URINE it was in 1 and got “-” again). Therefore U must be in position 1.  
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was in 5, 4, 3, 4, and 5 and always got “-” or “x”). Therefore E must be in position 2. But position 2 is already R. This is impossible.  

Wait — that contradiction means our interpretation must be wrong. Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

CRUEL feedback: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)  
This means:  
- R is correct in position 2  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (the “✓” here actually means “present but wrong position”, not “correct position”)  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (the “✓” here also means “present but wrong position”)  
- C and L are not in the word  

URINE feedback: U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I and N are not in the word  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So now we have:

Known positions  
- 2nd letter = R  

Known letters in word  
- U (somewhere, but not position 1 or 3)  
- E (somewhere, but not positions 1, 4, 5)  

Letters not in word  
A, O, S, C, L, I, N  

Possible positions for U and E:  
- U can only be in positions 2 or 4 or 5. But position 2 is R, so U can be 4 or 5.  
- E can only be in positions 2 or 3. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 3.  

So the pattern is: _ R E _ _  

And U must be in position 4 or 5.  

Also, remaining letters available (excluding A, O, S, C, L, I, N):  
D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

We have to place U in 4 or 5, and fill the first and fifth (or fourth) positions with allowed letters.  

Let’s try:

If E is in position 3, and R in 2, then:

Possible words:  
- D R E U _  
- T R E U _  
- P R E U _  
- G R E U _  

But we also know U must be in the word, so let’s try:

T R E U _  
We need a 5th letter that is allowed (not excluded) and forms a word.  
T R E U ?  → “TREUD” is not a word, “TREUS” is not a word, “TREUT” is not a word.  

P R E U _  → “PREUS” is not a word.  

G R E U _  → “GREUT” is not a word.  

Let’s try U in position 5:

_ R E _ U  

First letter: must be allowed (not excluded) and word must be valid.  
D R E _ U → “DRELU” is not a word.  
F R E _ U → “FRELU” is not a word.  
H R E _ U → “HRELU” is not a word.  
M R E _ U → “MRELU” is not a word.  
P R E _ U → “PRELU” is not a word.  
T R E _ U → “TRELU” is not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are working. Let’s step back.

We have pattern _ R E _ _ and must include U somewhere (positions 4 or 5).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit _ R E _ _ and contain U in 4 or 5, using allowed letters.

Looking at word lists:

- B R E W U – not valid  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- T R E N A – A excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded, P and U ok but pattern doesn’t fit  
- P R U D E – fits _ R U D E, but U is in 3 which is excluded  
- P R E U D – not a word  
- P R E V U – not a word  
- P R E M U – not a word  
- P R E U P – not a word  

Wait, let’s think systematically:

We need _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5, and letters from allowed set.

Allowed letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the banned ones).

But E is already in position 3, U in 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:

_ R E U _  
_ R E _ U  

Let’s try:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
H R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

_ R E _ U  

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the constraints.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback. Let’s re-express:

From CRUEL:  
- R is correct in position 2  
- U is in word but not in position 3  
- E is in word but not in position 4  
- C and L are not in word  

From URINE:  
- U is in word but not in position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I and N are not in word  
- E is in word but not in position 5  

So:

- Position 2 = R  
- U must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, 3, 5? Wait: in CRUEL U was in 3 and got “-” (wrong position), in URINE U was in 1 and got “-” (wrong position), so U cannot be in 1 or 3. So U can be 4 or 5.  
- E must be in position 3 (because it cannot be 1, 4, 5 and position 2 is R).  

Thus pattern is: _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5.

Let’s list valid English words fitting _ R E _ _ and containing U in 4 or 5, using allowed letters (excluding A, O, S, C, L, I, N).

Valid words:

- B R E W U – not valid  
- B R E D U – not valid  
- D R E W U – not valid  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded  
- P R U D E – U in 3 excluded  
- P R E V U – not valid  
- P R E M U – not valid  
- P R E U D – not valid  
- P R E U P – not valid  

Wait, let me think of actual words:

- B R E W U – no  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- H U R E D – H U R E D is valid, but U is in 1, which is excluded  
- P R E V U – no  
- P R E M U – no  
- T R E N D – N excluded  

Actually, “BREWN” is invalid (N), “BREWS” invalid (S), “DREWS” invalid (S), “FREED” invalid (D but pattern _ R E D _), “FREEN” invalid (N), “GREEN” invalid (N), “PREVU” invalid, “PREST” invalid (S), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREWS” invalid (S).

The only valid word I can find fitting _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5 is “BREWD” but D is allowed, but “BREWD” is not a standard English word.

Next possibility: maybe E is in position 3 and U in 5:

_ R E _ U  

Valid words:

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these are valid. Let me try U in 4:

_ R E U _  

Valid words:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

Still nothing.

Wait, let me think of “DREWS” but S is excluded.

“FREUD” is a valid word, but I is excluded (I is excluded from URINE feedback), but F, R, E, U, D are all allowed.

FREUD: F R E U D  
- Fits pattern _ R E U _  
- U is in position 4 (allowed)  
- E is in position 3 (required)  
- Letters: F, R, E, U, D – none are excluded.

This seems to fit all constraints.

- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded  
- P R U D E – U in 3 excluded  
- P R E V U – not valid  
- P R E M U – not valid  
- P R E U D – not valid  
- P R E U P – not valid  

Wait, let me think of actual words:

- B R E W U – no  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- H U R E D – H U R E D is valid, but U is in 1, which is excluded  
- P R E V U – no  
- P R E M U – no  
- T R E N D – N excluded  

Actually, “BREWN” is invalid (N), “BREWS” invalid (S), “DREWS” invalid (S), “FREED” invalid (D but pattern _ R E D _), “FREEN” invalid (N), “GREEN” invalid (N), “PREVU” invalid, “PREST” invalid (S), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREWS” invalid (S).

The only valid word I can find fitting _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5 is “BREWD” but D is allowed, but “BREWD” is not a standard English word.

Next possibility: maybe E is in position 3 and U in 5:

_ R E _ U  

Valid words:

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these are valid. Let me try U in 4:

_ R E U _  

Valid words:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

Still nothing.

Wait, let me think of “DREWS” but S is excluded.

“FREUD” is a valid word, but I is excluded (I is excluded from URINE feedback), but F, R, E, U, D are all allowed.

FREUD: F R E U D  
- Fits pattern _ R E U _  
- U is in position 4 (allowed)  
- E is in position 3 (required)  
- Letters: F, R, E, U, D – none are excluded.

This seems to fit all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters in one guess, which should provide strong feedback for narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ R _ _ _
2. It contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position (since E was in position 5 in AROSE and is marked as wrong position).
3. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the 2nd position
- Contains E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 - but not 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

Let me think of words that fit _ R _ _ _ and contain E elsewhere. Some possibilities:
- TREND (but has N and D - let's see)
- CRUEL (but has U and L)
- DRIFT (but has I and F)
- BRIDE (but has I and D)

Looking for words with E in position 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _ : ERGOT (but has G and T)
- _ R E _ _ : DREEL (not valid), TREAD (but A is invalid), CREEK (but C is ok, K is ok)
- _ R _ E _ : FRERE (invalid), PRUNE (but U is ok, N is ok)
- _ R _ _ E : TRICE (but I is ok, C is ok)

A good candidate is ""TREAD"" but A is invalid. Next is ""BRIDE"" which has I and D - both valid. Another is ""CRUEL"" which has U and L - both valid. 

Let me choose ""CRUEL"" because C, R, U, E, L are all valid letters not excluded, and R is in correct position, E is present but not in position 5.

<guess>CRUEL</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRUEL:

- C is not in the word (x)  
- R is in the correct 2nd position (✓) – already known  
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- E is in the correct 4th position (✓)  
- L is not in the word (x)  

So the pattern is now:  
_ R _ E _  

And we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, C, L  
- Letters in the word: R (position 2), E (position 4), U (somewhere else, but not position 3)  

U cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in CRUEL and feedback was “-”), so U must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U R _ E _   (U in position 1)  
- _ R _ E U   (U in position 5)  

Let’s list valid letters left to use (excluding A, O, S, C, L). Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, Y (Y can act as vowel).  

Try U R _ E _ :  
- URINE – but I and N are ok, but “URINE” is 5 letters.  
- URGER – G is ok, but double G may be rare.  
- URLET – L is excluded.  

Try _ R _ E U :  
- D R I E U – not a word.  
- P R I E U – not a word.  
- T R I E U – not a word.  
- N R I E U – not a word.  
- D R U E U – not valid.  

Another angle: U must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1 and 5. Let’s try U in 1: UR…E…  
- URINE – valid word. Letters: U, R, I, N, E.  
  - U: new position (1) – ok  
  - R: position 2 – correct  
  - I: new letter, not excluded  
  - N: new letter, not excluded  
  - E: position 4 – correct  

No conflicts. URINE seems like the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Known positions  
   - 2nd letter = R (✓ from all guesses)

2. Known letters that are somewhere in the word  
   - E (✓ in 4th position from CRUEL)  
   - U (✓ from CRUEL, but wrong position in CRUEL and URINE)  

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N

4. Positions ruled out for U and E  
   - U cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was tried in 3 and 5 and got “-” both times; in URINE it was in 1 and got “-” again). Therefore U must be in position 1.  
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was in 5, 4, 3, 4, and 5 and always got “-” or “x”). Therefore E must be in position 2. But position 2 is already R. This is impossible.  

Wait — that contradiction means our interpretation must be wrong. Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

CRUEL feedback: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)  
This means:  
- R is correct in position 2  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (the “✓” here actually means “present but wrong position”, not “correct position”)  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (the “✓” here also means “present but wrong position”)  
- C and L are not in the word  

URINE feedback: U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I and N are not in the word  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So now we have:

Known positions  
- 2nd letter = R  

Known letters in word  
- U (somewhere, but not position 1 or 3)  
- E (somewhere, but not positions 1, 4, 5)  

Letters not in word  
A, O, S, C, L, I, N  

Possible positions for U and E:  
- U can only be in positions 2 or 4 or 5. But position 2 is R, so U can be 4 or 5.  
- E can only be in positions 2 or 3. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 3.  

So the pattern is: _ R E _ _  

And U must be in position 4 or 5.  

Also, remaining letters available (excluding A, O, S, C, L, I, N):  
D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

We have to place U in 4 or 5, and fill the first and fifth (or fourth) positions with allowed letters.  

Let’s try:

If E is in position 3, and R in 2, then:

Possible words:  
- D R E U _  
- T R E U _  
- P R E U _  
- G R E U _  

But we also know U must be in the word, so let’s try:

T R E U _  
We need a 5th letter that is allowed (not excluded) and forms a word.  
T R E U ?  → “TREUD” is not a word, “TREUS” is not a word, “TREUT” is not a word.  

P R E U _  → “PREUS” is not a word.  

G R E U _  → “GREUT” is not a word.  

Let’s try U in position 5:

_ R E _ U  

First letter: must be allowed (not excluded) and word must be valid.  
D R E _ U → “DRELU” is not a word.  
F R E _ U → “FRELU” is not a word.  
H R E _ U → “HRELU” is not a word.  
M R E _ U → “MRELU” is not a word.  
P R E _ U → “PRELU” is not a word.  
T R E _ U → “TRELU” is not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are working. Let’s step back.

We have pattern _ R E _ _ and must include U somewhere (positions 4 or 5).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit _ R E _ _ and contain U in 4 or 5, using allowed letters.

Looking at word lists:

- B R E W U – not valid  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- T R E N A – A excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded, P and U ok but pattern doesn’t fit  
- P R U D E – fits _ R U D E, but U is in 3 which is excluded  
- P R E U D – not a word  
- P R E V U – not a word  
- P R E M U – not a word  
- P R E U P – not a word  

Wait, let’s think systematically:

We need _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5, and letters from allowed set.

Allowed letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the banned ones).

But E is already in position 3, U in 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:

_ R E U _  
_ R E _ U  

Let’s try:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
H R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

_ R E _ U  

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the constraints.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback. Let’s re-express:

From CRUEL:  
- R is correct in position 2  
- U is in word but not in position 3  
- E is in word but not in position 4  
- C and L are not in word  

From URINE:  
- U is in word but not in position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I and N are not in word  
- E is in word but not in position 5  

So:

- Position 2 = R  
- U must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, 3, 5? Wait: in CRUEL U was in 3 and got “-” (wrong position), in URINE U was in 1 and got “-” (wrong position), so U cannot be in 1 or 3. So U can be 4 or 5.  
- E must be in position 3 (because it cannot be 1, 4, 5 and position 2 is R).  

Thus pattern is: _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5.

Let’s list valid English words fitting _ R E _ _ and containing U in 4 or 5, using allowed letters (excluding A, O, S, C, L, I, N).

Valid words:

- B R E W U – not valid  
- B R E D U – not valid  
- D R E W U – not valid  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded  
- P R U D E – U in 3 excluded  
- P R E V U – not valid  
- P R E M U – not valid  
- P R E U D – not valid  
- P R E U P – not valid  

Wait, let me think of actual words:

- B R E W U – no  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- H U R E D – H U R E D is valid, but U is in 1, which is excluded  
- P R E V U – no  
- P R E M U – no  
- T R E N D – N excluded  

Actually, “BREWN” is invalid (N), “BREWS” invalid (S), “DREWS” invalid (S), “FREED” invalid (D but pattern _ R E D _), “FREEN” invalid (N), “GREEN” invalid (N), “PREVU” invalid, “PREST” invalid (S), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREWS” invalid (S).

The only valid word I can find fitting _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5 is “BREWD” but D is allowed, but “BREWD” is not a standard English word.

Next possibility: maybe E is in position 3 and U in 5:

_ R E _ U  

Valid words:

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these are valid. Let me try U in 4:

_ R E U _  

Valid words:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

Still nothing.

Wait, let me think of “DREWS” but S is excluded.

“FREUD” is a valid word, but I is excluded (I is excluded from URINE feedback), but F, R, E, U, D are all allowed.

FREUD: F R E U D  
- Fits pattern _ R E U _  
- U is in position 4 (allowed)  
- E is in position 3 (required)  
- Letters: F, R, E, U, D – none are excluded.

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let’s gather every constraint we now have.

1. Position 2 is definitely R (✓ in every guess).

2. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (but we still don’t know where):
   - U (from CRUEL: present but wrong position)
   - E (from CRUEL: present but wrong position)

3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D

4. Additional positional restrictions revealed by the last guess (FREUD):
   - E is **not** in position 3 (because FREUD gave E(-) for position 3)
   - U is **not** in position 4 (because FREUD gave U(-) for position 4)

5. From earlier feedback:
   - U cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (positions 1 and 3 ruled out by URINE and FREUD, 4 by FREUD).  
     Therefore **U must be in position 2**, but position 2 is already R.  
     This is impossible ⇒ our earlier interpretation must be missing something.

Wait—let’s re-examine the feedback symbols carefully:

- ✓ = letter is in the word **and in the correct position**
- - = letter is in the word **but in the wrong position**
- x = letter is **not** in the word

Re-interpret the feedback:

CRUEL: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
- R is correct in position 2.
- U is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 3).
- E is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 4).

URINE: U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)
- R correct in 2.
- U is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 1).
- I and N are not in word.
- E is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 5).

FREUD: F(x) R(✓) E(-) U(-) D(x)
- R correct in 2.
- E is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 3).
- U is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 4).
- F and D are not in word.

Now we have:

- Position 2 = R
- U must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.
  ⇒ Only remaining spot for U is **position 5**.
- E must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5.
  ⇒ Only remaining spot for E is **position 1**.

So the pattern is forced:  
E R _ _ U

Letters still allowed (excluding banned A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D):  
B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need the 3rd and 4th letters from these, forming a valid English word.

Possible 5-letter words matching E R _ _ U:

- ERGOU – not valid  
- ERGOT – T is allowed, forms a word  
- ERGUM – not valid  
- ERGUY – not valid  
- ERGEX – not valid  
- ERGEB – not valid  
- ERGAS – S excluded  
- ERGAL – L excluded  

“ERGOT” is the only common word I can find that fits:  
E R G O T  
- O is excluded (from AROSE feedback) ⇒ invalid.

Next possibility: E R G _ U.

- E R G A U – A excluded  
- E R G E U – E already used once, but double E is allowed; however “ERGEU” is not a word.  
- E R G I U – I excluded  
- E R G K U – not a word  
- E R G M U – not a word  
- E R G P U – not a word  
- E R G T U – not a word  

Let’s try E R _ K U, E R _ M U, etc.

Another approach: maybe the 3rd letter is T and 4th is H: E R T H U – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in …RU:

- ERUPT – P is allowed, T is allowed.  
  Check letters: E, R, U, P, T.  
  - E is allowed in position 1.  
  - R in 2 (correct).  
  - U in 5 (allowed).  
  - P and T are not excluded.  
  This fits every constraint.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters in one guess, which should provide strong feedback for narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ R _ _ _
2. It contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position (since E was in position 5 in AROSE and is marked as wrong position).
3. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the 2nd position
- Contains E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 - but not 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

Let me think of words that fit _ R _ _ _ and contain E elsewhere. Some possibilities:
- TREND (but has N and D - let's see)
- CRUEL (but has U and L)
- DRIFT (but has I and F)
- BRIDE (but has I and D)

Looking for words with E in position 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _ : ERGOT (but has G and T)
- _ R E _ _ : DREEL (not valid), TREAD (but A is invalid), CREEK (but C is ok, K is ok)
- _ R _ E _ : FRERE (invalid), PRUNE (but U is ok, N is ok)
- _ R _ _ E : TRICE (but I is ok, C is ok)

A good candidate is ""TREAD"" but A is invalid. Next is ""BRIDE"" which has I and D - both valid. Another is ""CRUEL"" which has U and L - both valid. 

Let me choose ""CRUEL"" because C, R, U, E, L are all valid letters not excluded, and R is in correct position, E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRUEL:

- C is not in the word (x)  
- R is in the correct 2nd position (✓) – already known  
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- E is in the correct 4th position (✓)  
- L is not in the word (x)  

So the pattern is now:  
_ R _ E _  

And we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, C, L  
- Letters in the word: R (position 2), E (position 4), U (somewhere else, but not position 3)  

U cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in CRUEL and feedback was “-”), so U must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U R _ E _   (U in position 1)  
- _ R _ E U   (U in position 5)  

Let’s list valid letters left to use (excluding A, O, S, C, L). Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, Y (Y can act as vowel).  

Try U R _ E _ :  
- URINE – but I and N are ok, but “URINE” is 5 letters.  
- URGER – G is ok, but double G may be rare.  
- URLET – L is excluded.  

Try _ R _ E U :  
- D R I E U – not a word.  
- P R I E U – not a word.  
- T R I E U – not a word.  
- N R I E U – not a word.  
- D R U E U – not valid.  

Another angle: U must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1 and 5. Let’s try U in 1: UR…E…  
- URINE – valid word. Letters: U, R, I, N, E.  
  - U: new position (1) – ok  
  - R: position 2 – correct  
  - I: new letter, not excluded  
  - N: new letter, not excluded  
  - E: position 4 – correct  

No conflicts. URINE seems like the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Known positions  
   - 2nd letter = R (✓ from all guesses)

2. Known letters that are somewhere in the word  
   - E (✓ in 4th position from CRUEL)  
   - U (✓ from CRUEL, but wrong position in CRUEL and URINE)  

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N

4. Positions ruled out for U and E  
   - U cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was tried in 3 and 5 and got “-” both times; in URINE it was in 1 and got “-” again). Therefore U must be in position 1.  
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was in 5, 4, 3, 4, and 5 and always got “-” or “x”). Therefore E must be in position 2. But position 2 is already R. This is impossible.  

Wait — that contradiction means our interpretation must be wrong. Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

CRUEL feedback: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)  
This means:  
- R is correct in position 2  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (the “✓” here actually means “present but wrong position”, not “correct position”)  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (the “✓” here also means “present but wrong position”)  
- C and L are not in the word  

URINE feedback: U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I and N are not in the word  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So now we have:

Known positions  
- 2nd letter = R  

Known letters in word  
- U (somewhere, but not position 1 or 3)  
- E (somewhere, but not positions 1, 4, 5)  

Letters not in word  
A, O, S, C, L, I, N  

Possible positions for U and E:  
- U can only be in positions 2 or 4 or 5. But position 2 is R, so U can be 4 or 5.  
- E can only be in positions 2 or 3. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 3.  

So the pattern is: _ R E _ _  

And U must be in position 4 or 5.  

Also, remaining letters available (excluding A, O, S, C, L, I, N):  
D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

We have to place U in 4 or 5, and fill the first and fifth (or fourth) positions with allowed letters.  

Let’s try:

If E is in position 3, and R in 2, then:

Possible words:  
- D R E U _  
- T R E U _  
- P R E U _  
- G R E U _  

But we also know U must be in the word, so let’s try:

T R E U _  
We need a 5th letter that is allowed (not excluded) and forms a word.  
T R E U ?  → “TREUD” is not a word, “TREUS” is not a word, “TREUT” is not a word.  

P R E U _  → “PREUS” is not a word.  

G R E U _  → “GREUT” is not a word.  

Let’s try U in position 5:

_ R E _ U  

First letter: must be allowed (not excluded) and word must be valid.  
D R E _ U → “DRELU” is not a word.  
F R E _ U → “FRELU” is not a word.  
H R E _ U → “HRELU” is not a word.  
M R E _ U → “MRELU” is not a word.  
P R E _ U → “PRELU” is not a word.  
T R E _ U → “TRELU” is not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are working. Let’s step back.

We have pattern _ R E _ _ and must include U somewhere (positions 4 or 5).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit _ R E _ _ and contain U in 4 or 5, using allowed letters.

Looking at word lists:

- B R E W U – not valid  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- T R E N A – A excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded, P and U ok but pattern doesn’t fit  
- P R U D E – fits _ R U D E, but U is in 3 which is excluded  
- P R E U D – not a word  
- P R E V U – not a word  
- P R E M U – not a word  
- P R E U P – not a word  

Wait, let’s think systematically:

We need _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5, and letters from allowed set.

Allowed letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the banned ones).

But E is already in position 3, U in 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:

_ R E U _  
_ R E _ U  

Let’s try:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
H R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

_ R E _ U  

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the constraints.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback. Let’s re-express:

From CRUEL:  
- R is correct in position 2  
- U is in word but not in position 3  
- E is in word but not in position 4  
- C and L are not in word  

From URINE:  
- U is in word but not in position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I and N are not in word  
- E is in word but not in position 5  

So:

- Position 2 = R  
- U must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, 3, 5? Wait: in CRUEL U was in 3 and got “-” (wrong position), in URINE U was in 1 and got “-” (wrong position), so U cannot be in 1 or 3. So U can be 4 or 5.  
- E must be in position 3 (because it cannot be 1, 4, 5 and position 2 is R).  

Thus pattern is: _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5.

Let’s list valid English words fitting _ R E _ _ and containing U in 4 or 5, using allowed letters (excluding A, O, S, C, L, I, N).

Valid words:

- B R E W U – not valid  
- B R E D U – not valid  
- D R E W U – not valid  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- P R E S S – S excluded  
- T R E N D – N excluded  
- P R U S E – S excluded  
- P R U D E – U in 3 excluded  
- P R E V U – not valid  
- P R E M U – not valid  
- P R E U D – not valid  
- P R E U P – not valid  

Wait, let me think of actual words:

- B R E W U – no  
- B R E N T – N excluded  
- D R E S S – S excluded  
- F R E N D – N excluded  
- G R E E N – N excluded  
- H U R E D – H U R E D is valid, but U is in 1, which is excluded  
- P R E V U – no  
- P R E M U – no  
- T R E N D – N excluded  

Actually, “BREWN” is invalid (N), “BREWS” invalid (S), “DREWS” invalid (S), “FREED” invalid (D but pattern _ R E D _), “FREEN” invalid (N), “GREEN” invalid (N), “PREVU” invalid, “PREST” invalid (S), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREND” invalid (N), “TREWS” invalid (S).

The only valid word I can find fitting _ R E _ _ with U in 4 or 5 is “BREWD” but D is allowed, but “BREWD” is not a standard English word.

Next possibility: maybe E is in position 3 and U in 5:

_ R E _ U  

Valid words:

B R E D U – not valid  
B R E K U – not valid  
D R E K U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

None of these are valid. Let me try U in 4:

_ R E U _  

Valid words:

B R E W U – not valid  
B R E D U – not valid  
D R E W U – not valid  
F R E D U – not valid  
G R E D U – not valid  
P R E D U – not valid  
T R E D U – not valid  

Still nothing.

Wait, let me think of “DREWS” but S is excluded.

“FREUD” is a valid word, but I is excluded (I is excluded from URINE feedback), but F, R, E, U, D are all allowed.

FREUD: F R E U D  
- Fits pattern _ R E U _  
- U is in position 4 (allowed)  
- E is in position 3 (required)  
- Letters: F, R, E, U, D – none are excluded.

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let’s gather every constraint we now have.

1. Position 2 is definitely R (✓ in every guess).

2. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (but we still don’t know where):
   - U (from CRUEL: present but wrong position)
   - E (from CRUEL: present but wrong position)

3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D

4. Additional positional restrictions revealed by the last guess (FREUD):
   - E is **not** in position 3 (because FREUD gave E(-) for position 3)
   - U is **not** in position 4 (because FREUD gave U(-) for position 4)

5. From earlier feedback:
   - U cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (positions 1 and 3 ruled out by URINE and FREUD, 4 by FREUD).  
     Therefore **U must be in position 2**, but position 2 is already R.  
     This is impossible ⇒ our earlier interpretation must be missing something.

Wait—let’s re-examine the feedback symbols carefully:

- ✓ = letter is in the word **and in the correct position**
- - = letter is in the word **but in the wrong position**
- x = letter is **not** in the word

Re-interpret the feedback:

CRUEL: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
- R is correct in position 2.
- U is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 3).
- E is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 4).

URINE: U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)
- R correct in 2.
- U is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 1).
- I and N are not in word.
- E is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 5).

FREUD: F(x) R(✓) E(-) U(-) D(x)
- R correct in 2.
- E is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 3).
- U is in word but **wrong position** (so not position 4).
- F and D are not in word.

Now we have:

- Position 2 = R
- U must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.
  ⇒ Only remaining spot for U is **position 5**.
- E must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5.
  ⇒ Only remaining spot for E is **position 1**.

So the pattern is forced:  
E R _ _ U

Letters still allowed (excluding banned A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D):  
B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need the 3rd and 4th letters from these, forming a valid English word.

Possible 5-letter words matching E R _ _ U:

- ERGOU – not valid  
- ERGOT – T is allowed, forms a word  
- ERGUM – not valid  
- ERGUY – not valid  
- ERGEX – not valid  
- ERGEB – not valid  
- ERGAS – S excluded  
- ERGAL – L excluded  

“ERGOT” is the only common word I can find that fits:  
E R G O T  
- O is excluded (from AROSE feedback) ⇒ invalid.

Next possibility: E R G _ U.

- E R G A U – A excluded  
- E R G E U – E already used once, but double E is allowed; however “ERGEU” is not a word.  
- E R G I U – I excluded  
- E R G K U – not a word  
- E R G M U – not a word  
- E R G P U – not a word  
- E R G T U – not a word  

Let’s try E R _ K U, E R _ M U, etc.

Another approach: maybe the 3rd letter is T and 4th is H: E R T H U – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in …RU:

- ERUPT – P is allowed, T is allowed.  
  Check letters: E, R, U, P, T.  
  - E is allowed in position 1.  
  - R in 2 (correct).  
  - U in 5 (allowed).  
  - P and T are not excluded.  
  This fits every constraint.

Let’s list every hard fact we now have.

1. Position 2 is fixed: R (✓ in every guess).
   Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _

2. Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
   - U (from CRUEL and URINE both gave “-” for U, so U must appear exactly once and it is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5)
   - E (from AROSE, CRUEL, URINE, FREUD all gave “-” or “✓” but never “x”, so E appears exactly once and it is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D, P

4. From the last guess (ERUPT):
   - E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1
   - U(✓)  → U is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3)
   - T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 5

Now we can fill in the pattern:

- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = U
- T must appear somewhere, but not in position 5 → only possible at position 4
- E must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → only possible at position 2, but position 2 is R → contradiction

Wait, that can’t be. Let’s re-examine the feedback for ERUPT carefully:

ERUPT -> E(-) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) T(-)

- E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R(✓) means R is in the correct position (position 2).
- U(✓) means U is in the correct position (position 3).
- P(x) means P is NOT in the word.
- T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is now:

- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = U
- T must appear somewhere, but not in position 5 → only possible at position 4
- E must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → the only remaining spot is position 2, but position 2 is R → impossible

This contradiction implies my earlier interpretation was incomplete. Let’s re-express the feedback symbols more carefully:

- ✓ = letter is in the word and in the correct position
- - = letter is in the word but in the wrong position
- x = letter is not in the word

Re-interpret the feedback line by line:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
- R is correct in position 2
- E is in word but wrong position (so not position 5)

Guess 2: CRUEL → C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
- R correct in 2
- U is in word but wrong position (so not 3)
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 4)

Guess 3: URINE → U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)
- R correct in 2
- U is in word but wrong position (so not 1)
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 5)

Guess 4: FREUD → F(x) R(✓) E(-) U(-) D(x)
- R correct in 2
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 3)
- U is in word but wrong position (so not 4)

Guess 5: ERUPT → E(-) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) T(-)
- R correct in 2
- U is in word and in correct position (position 3)
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 1)
- T is in word but wrong position (so not 5)

Now the constraints are:

- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = U
- E is in word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → impossible, because positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are the only other positions left after 2.

Wait, that can’t be. Let’s list the positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ R _ _ _

From ERUPT feedback:
- U is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in word but not position 1 (from ERUPT E(-))
- T is in word but not position 5 (from ERUPT T(-))

So the word looks like: _ R U _ _

Letters remaining to place: E and T (and possibly others, but we’ve only confirmed E and T must appear).

Constraints:
- E must appear exactly once (never seen x), and it is NOT in position 1 (from ERUPT E(-))
- T must appear exactly once (never seen x), and it is NOT in position 5 (from ERUPT T(-))
- Positions 4 and 5 are open, but position 5 cannot be T or E (from constraints)
- Position 1 cannot be E (from ERUPT E(-)), and cannot be any banned letters.

Letters already excluded: A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D, P

So possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: B, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T and E must appear).

We have:
- E must appear, and cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from constraints), and position 3 is U, position 2 is R → only possible position for E is 4
- T must appear, and cannot be in position 5 → possible positions 1 or 4
- But position 4 is taken by E (if E is allowed there)

From ERUPT feedback, E is in word but wrong position (so not 1), and position 3 is U, 2 is R, so E must be in 4 or 5. But E cannot be in 5 (from CRUEL E(-) in position 4 and AROSE E(-) in position 5), so E must be in 4.

Thus:
Position 4 = E

Then T must be in position 1 or 5, but cannot be in 5 (from ERUPT T(-)), so T must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is: T R U _ _

We still need a letter for position 5. Available letters (not excluded, not used yet): B, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English words TRU__:

- TRUER – but E is already in 4, R is already in 2
- TRUG – valid word (a small bucket)
- TRUL – not a word
- TRUM – not a word
- TRUG is the only common word I can find.

Check letters:
- T, R, U, G – all allowed
- Fits all constraints:
  - T in position 1 (allowed)
  - R in 2 (correct)
  - U in 3 (correct)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - G in 5 (allowed)

Thus the next guess is TRUG.

1. Position 2 is fixed: R (✓ in every guess).

2. Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
   - U (from CRUEL and URINE both gave “-” for U, so U must appear exactly once and it is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5)
   - E (from AROSE, CRUEL, URINE, FREUD all gave “-” or “✓” but never “x”, so E appears exactly once and it is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D, P

4. From the last guess (ERUPT):
   - E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1
   - U(✓)  → U is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3)
   - T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 5

Now we can fill in the pattern:

- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = U
- T must appear somewhere, but not in position 5 → only possible at position 4
- E must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → only possible at position 2, but position 2 is R → contradiction

Wait, that can’t be. Let’s re-examine the feedback for ERUPT carefully:

ERUPT -> E(-) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) T(-)

- E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R(✓) means R is in the correct position (position 2).
- U(✓) means U is in the correct position (position 3).
- P(x) means P is NOT in the word.
- T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is now:

- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = U
- T must appear somewhere, but not in position 5 → only possible at position 4
- E must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → the only remaining spot is position 2, but position 2 is R → impossible

This contradiction implies my earlier interpretation was incomplete. Let’s re-express the feedback symbols more carefully:

- ✓ = letter is in the word and in the correct position
- - = letter is in the word but in the wrong position
- x = letter is not in the word

Re-interpret the feedback line by line:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
- R is correct in position 2
- E is in word but wrong position (so not position 5)

Guess 2: CRUEL → C(x) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(x)
- R correct in 2
- U is in word but wrong position (so not 3)
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 4)

Guess 3: URINE → U(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x) E(-)
- R correct in 2
- U is in word but wrong position (so not 1)
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 5)

Guess 4: FREUD → F(x) R(✓) E(-) U(-) D(x)
- R correct in 2
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 3)
- U is in word but wrong position (so not 4)

Guess 5: ERUPT → E(-) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) T(-)
- R correct in 2
- U is in word and in correct position (position 3)
- E is in word but wrong position (so not 1)
- T is in word but wrong position (so not 5)

Now the constraints are:

- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = U
- E is in word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → impossible, because positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are the only other positions left after 2.

Wait, that can’t be. Let’s list the positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ R _ _ _

From ERUPT feedback:
- U is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in word but not position 1 (from ERUPT E(-))
- T is in word but not position 5 (from ERUPT T(-))

So the word looks like: _ R U _ _

Letters remaining to place: E and T (and possibly others, but we’ve only confirmed E and T must appear).

Constraints:
- E must appear exactly once (never seen x), and it is NOT in position 1 (from ERUPT E(-))
- T must appear exactly once (never seen x), and it is NOT in position 5 (from ERUPT T(-))
- Positions 4 and 5 are open, but position 5 cannot be T or E (from constraints)
- Position 1 cannot be E (from ERUPT E(-)), and cannot be any banned letters.

Letters already excluded: A, O, S, C, L, I, N, F, D, P

So possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: B, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T and E must appear).

We have:
- E must appear, and cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from constraints), and position 3 is U, position 2 is R → only possible position for E is 4
- T must appear, and cannot be in position 5 → possible positions 1 or 4
- But position 4 is taken by E (if E is allowed there)

From ERUPT feedback, E is in word but wrong position (so not 1), and position 3 is U, 2 is R, so E must be in 4 or 5. But E cannot be in 5 (from CRUEL E(-) in position 4 and AROSE E(-) in position 5), so E must be in 4.

Thus:
Position 4 = E

Then T must be in position 1 or 5, but cannot be in 5 (from ERUPT T(-)), so T must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is: T R U _ _

We still need a letter for position 5. Available letters (not excluded, not used yet): B, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English words TRU__:

- TRUER – but E is already in 4, R is already in 2

- Fits all constraints:
  - T in position 1 (allowed)
  - R in 2 (correct)
  - U in 3 (correct)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - G in 5 (allowed)

Thus the next guess is TRUG.",Guess 6: TRUG -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.,FAIL
