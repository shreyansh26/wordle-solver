### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The goal is to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters, none of which are repeated. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ E

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O as its 3rd letter.
2. Has E as its 5th letter.
3. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
4. Uses valid remaining common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: 
- DOGIE (but has I and D - not sure)
- MONEY (but has N and Y)
- CHOKE (but has C and H - but K might be useful)
- GLOVE (but has G and L and V - V is less common)
- FOGEY (but has F and G and Y)

Looking for words with common remaining letters (T, L, N, D, C, H, etc.), ""CHOKE"" seems good as it tests C, H, K in positions 1, 2, 4.

But let me think of a word that fits better: ""DOGEY"" - but Y is less common.

Actually, ""MONEY"" is a good test: M, N, Y in positions 1, 2, 4. But Y is less common.

""TONNE"" - but has N twice and T is good.

""TONNE"" has T, O, N, N, E - but N repeats and we don't know about N yet.

""POISE"" - but S is already ruled out.

""FOGEY"" - F, O, G, E, Y - tests F, G, Y.

Hmm, perhaps ""DOGEY"" is better as it tests D, G, Y.

But let me think of a word with more common letters: ""MONEY"" has M, O, N, E, Y - tests M, N, Y.

Actually, ""MONET"" is a word (as in Monet, the painter), but E is already in position 5, so ""MONET"" would have E in position 4 which contradicts feedback.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so positions 1,2,4 can be any letters except A,R,S.

A good word would be ""DOGEY"" - D(1), O(3), G(2), E(5), Y(4). But Y is less common.

Alternatively, ""CHOKE"" - C(1), H(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). This tests C, H, K which are all new letters.

This seems better as it introduces three new common letters (C, H, K) to test.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The goal is to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters, none of which are repeated. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ E

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O as its 3rd letter.
2. Has E as its 5th letter.
3. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
4. Uses valid remaining common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: 
- DOGIE (but has I and D - not sure)
- MONEY (but has N and Y)
- CHOKE (but has C and H - but K might be useful)
- GLOVE (but has G and L and V - V is less common)
- FOGEY (but has F and G and Y)

Looking for words with common remaining letters (T, L, N, D, C, H, etc.), ""CHOKE"" seems good as it tests C, H, K in positions 1, 2, 4.

But let me think of a word that fits better: ""DOGEY"" - but Y is less common.

Actually, ""MONEY"" is a good test: M, N, Y in positions 1, 2, 4. But Y is less common.

""TONNE"" - but has N twice and T is good.

""TONNE"" has T, O, N, N, E - but N repeats and we don't know about N yet.

""POISE"" - but S is already ruled out.

""FOGEY"" - F, O, G, E, Y - tests F, G, Y.

Hmm, perhaps ""DOGEY"" is better as it tests D, G, Y.

But let me think of a word with more common letters: ""MONEY"" has M, O, N, E, Y - tests M, N, Y.

Actually, ""MONET"" is a word (as in Monet, the painter), but E is already in position 5, so ""MONET"" would have E in position 4 which contradicts feedback.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so positions 1,2,4 can be any letters except A,R,S.

A good word would be ""DOGEY"" - D(1), O(3), G(2), E(5), Y(4). But Y is less common.

Alternatively, ""CHOKE"" - C(1), H(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). This tests C, H, K which are all new letters.

This seems better as it introduces three new common letters (C, H, K) to test.

So I'll go with ""CHOKE"".

   - Remaining letters we can still use: B, D, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already confirmed O and E).

We need a 5-letter word that:

<|im_start|>assistant
Current known facts:
- Pattern is _ _ O _ E (O in position 3, E in position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, C, H, K, G, L, V.
- Remaining candidate letters (plus O and E already fixed): B, D, F, I, J, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ O _ E using only the allowed letters.

Scanning the remaining letters for common combinations:
- First two positions: any two of B, D, F, I, M, N, P, T, etc.
- Fourth position: any of B, D, F, I, M, N, P, T, etc.

Possible words:
- BOUND: but U is allowed, D is allowed - B O U N D - but pattern is _ _ O _ E, so BOUND would be B O U N D - position 3 is U, but we need O there - no.
- BINO: too short.
- DOUBT: D O U B T - position 3 is U - no.
- MONEY: M O N E Y - position 3 is N - no.
- BONEY: B O N E Y - position 3 is N - no.
- FOGIE: F O G I E - but G is ruled out.
- BOGIE: B O G I E - G is ruled out.
- DOZIE: Z is allowed, I is allowed - D O Z I E - but is DOZIE a word? Not common.
- FLOKE: L is ruled out.
- BLOKE: L is ruled out.
- MOME: too short.
- POME: too short.
- DOPE: too short.
- BOWNE: not a word.
- BONZE: Z is allowed - B O N Z E - position 3 is N - no.
- FONZE: F O N Z E - position 3 is N - no.
- TOMEE: not a word.
- TONNE: N is allowed, T is allowed - T O N N E - position 3 is N - no.
- TOPE: too short.
- BOWNE: not a word.
- BOOZE: Z is allowed - B O O Z E - position 3 is O - yes! B O O Z E - but is this a valid word? ""Booze"" is a valid word meaning alcohol.

But let's check letters: B, O, O, Z, E. None of A, R, S, C, H, K, G, L, V are present. This fits the pattern _ _ O _ E (positions: B O O Z E - position 3 is O, position 5 is E).

Another candidate: ""BOOZE"" seems to fit all constraints.

Alternative: ""DOOZE"" - but is this a word? Not common.

""FOOZE"" - not a word.

""MOOZE"" - not a word.

""POOZE"" - not a word.

""TOOZE"" - not a word.

""BOOZE"" seems the only valid word fitting the pattern.

Therefore, the next guess is ""BOOZE"".

From the new feedback on BOOZE:
- B(x) → B is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → There is an O in the word, but it is NOT in position 2 (the second O in BOOZE is in position 3, and the feedback is ""-"", meaning the O is in the word but wrong position). However, we already know from earlier feedback that the O is in position 3 (✓). So this ""-"" simply confirms the O is in position 3, and tells us there is another O elsewhere.
- O(✓) — confirms the O in position 3 is correct.
- Z(-) → Z is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) — confirms E in position 5 is correct.

So the pattern is _ _ O _ E, and we now know:
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, C, H, K, G, L, V, B.
- Additional letters ruled out from BOOZE: B and Z (but Z is in the word, just not in position 4).

Wait, let me re-read carefully:
- BOOZE feedback: B(x) → B is not in the word.
- O(-) → The first O (position 2) is in the word but wrong position. But we know O is in position 3, so this means there is another O in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(✓) → O is in position 3, correct.
- Z(-) → Z is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in position 5, correct.

So the word has:
- O in position 3.
- E in position 5.
- Another O somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not position 2, from the ""-"" on the first O).
- Z somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not position 4, and not position 3 because O is there).

So possible positions:
- O _ O _ E or _ O O _ E or _ _ O Z E
But Z cannot be in position 4 (from BOOZE feedback), so if Z is in position 4, that would be invalid. From BOOZE, Z is in the word but not in position 4, so Z must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, there is another O in the word (from O(-) in position 2), so the word must have two O's: one in position 3, and one more O in position 1 or 4 (but not position 2).

Let's consider possibilities:
1. O _ O _ E: Then Z must be in position 2 (since it can't be 4). So word would be O Z O _ E. Possible words: OZOME? Not valid. OZONE? But O is in position 3, so OZONE would have O in position 1 and 3, but we have O in position 3 confirmed, and another O somewhere else. OZONE has O in position 1 and 3, which would fit (O in position 3 confirmed, and O in position 1). But is OZONE a valid word? Yes, it's a valid 5-letter word.

2. _ O O _ E: Then Z must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 cannot be Z (from BOOZE feedback), so Z would have to be in position 1. Word would be Z O O _ E. Possible word: ZOOKE? Not valid. ZOOBE? Not valid. ZOOSE? Not valid.

3. _ _ O _ E with Z in position 1 or 2 and another O in position 1 or 4. But position 4 cannot have O if Z is in position 1 or 2, and we need another O. This seems limited.

The only valid word fitting these constraints seems to be OZONE:
- O in position 1 (additional O required)
- Z in position 2 (fits Z in word but not position 4)
- O in position 3 (confirmed)
- N is still allowed (not ruled out)
- E in position 5 (confirmed)

Letters used: O, Z, O, N, E. None of the ruled-out letters are present. This seems correct.
