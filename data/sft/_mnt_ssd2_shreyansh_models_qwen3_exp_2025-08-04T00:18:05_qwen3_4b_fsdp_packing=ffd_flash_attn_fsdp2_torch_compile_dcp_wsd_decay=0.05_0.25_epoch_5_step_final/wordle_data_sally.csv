1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and S,
- Does not contain R, O, or E,
- Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

A good next guess would be “STASH” because:
- It has S and A,
- It avoids R, O, E,
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in position 4),
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1).

This should give me more information about the positions of S and A and whether any other letters are present.

- S is correct in position 1 (so the word starts with S).
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, E, T, H.
- S is already locked in position 1.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5 (but S is in 1, so 2,4,5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S already used.

I need a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only allowed letters.

A good next guess is “SCANS”:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 3, but wait – feedback said A is not in position 3. So SCANS is invalid because A is in position 3.

Next option: “SANER” – but E is forbidden.

Next: “SALTY” – but T and Y are allowed, but T is already excluded.

Next: “SWASH” – but H is excluded.

Next: “SANDY” – D and Y are allowed, but let’s check A position: A is in 2 (allowed), word is S A N D Y. No forbidden letters.

But let’s think of a word that maximizes info. “SANDY” checks N, D, Y.

Another option: “SAGGY” – G, G, Y allowed.

But “SAGGY” has A in position 2 (good), and tests G and Y.

Alternatively “SAPPY” – P, P, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAPPY” because it tests P and Y, and A is in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

But wait – let’s check if A is allowed in position 2: yes, feedback only said A is not in 1 or 3.

So “SAPPY” is valid.

But actually, let me think of a word that uses A in position 4 or 5 to see more possibilities. 

“SALSA” – but A is repeated and S is already in 1.

“SASSY” – S is already in 1, and A is in 2, but S is repeated.

“SALTY” – A in 2, T is excluded.

“SANDY” – A in 2, D and Y allowed.

I’ll go with “SANDY” as it tests new letters D and Y, and A is in 2 (allowed).

But let me double-check: SANDY – S(✓), A in 2 (allowed), N, D, Y not excluded.

Yes.

Another option is “SALTY” but T is excluded.

So “SAPPY” is valid.

But actually, let me think of a word that uses A in position 4 or 5 to see more possibilities. 

“SALSA” – but A is repeated and S is already in 1.

“SASSY” – S is already in 1, and A is in 2, but S is repeated.

“SALTY” – A in 2, T is excluded.

“SANDY” – A in 2, D and Y allowed.

I’ll go with “SANDY” as it tests new letters D and Y, and A is in 2 (allowed).

But let me double-check: SANDY – S(✓), A in 2 (allowed), N, D, Y not excluded.

Yes.

Another option is “SALTY” but T is excluded.

“SAGGY” – G, G, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAGGY” to test G and Y.

But to maximize info, maybe “SALTY” is better, but T is excluded.

Next best is “SANDY”.

Final choice: SANDY.

The feedback on “sandwich” says “Model answer is not five letters,” so I must have used an invalid word.  
I intended to guess “sandwich” but it’s six letters, so I’ll instead use “sand” (but that’s four letters) – no, I need a valid five-letter word.

Let me re-pick a valid five-letter word that fits all constraints so far:

Known facts:
- Word starts with S (from stash feedback).
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 1, 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, E, T, H.
- Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word starting with S, with A in position 2, 4, or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- S A L V A – but V is allowed, but double A might not help.
- S A M B A – but M, B, A – but A is already known.
- S A N D Y – D, Y allowed.
- S A G G Y – G, Y allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.  
Also, A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and S,
- Does not contain R, O, or E,
- Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

A good next guess would be “STASH” because:
- It has S and A,
- It avoids R, O, E,
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in position 4),
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1).

This should give me more information about the positions of S and A and whether any other letters are present.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- R, O, E are not in the word.

Round 2: stash → S(✓) T(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
- S is correct in position 1 (so the word starts with S).
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, E, T, H.
- S is already locked in position 1.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5 (but S is in 1, so 2,4,5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S already used.

I need a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only allowed letters.

A good next guess is “SCANS”:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 3, but wait – feedback said A is not in position 3. So SCANS is invalid because A is in position 3.

Next option: “SANER” – but E is forbidden.

Next: “SALTY” – but T and Y are allowed, but T is already excluded.

Next: “SWASH” – but H is excluded.

Next: “SANDY” – D and Y are allowed, but let’s check A position: A is in 2 (allowed), word is S A N D Y. No forbidden letters.

But let’s think of a word that maximizes info. “SANDY” checks N, D, Y.

Another option: “SAGGY” – G, G, Y allowed.

But “SAGGY” has A in position 2 (good), and tests G and Y.

Alternatively “SAPPY” – P, P, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAPPY” because it tests P and Y, and A is in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

But wait – let’s check if A is allowed in position 2: yes, feedback only said A is not in 1 or 3.

So “SAPPY” is valid.

But actually, let me think of a word that uses A in position 4 or 5 to see more possibilities. 

“SALSA” – but A is repeated and S is already in 1.

“SASSY” – S is already in 1, and A is in 2, but S is repeated.

“SALTY” – A in 2, T is excluded.

“SANDY” – A in 2, D and Y allowed.

I’ll go with “SANDY” as it tests new letters D and Y, and A is in 2 (allowed).

But let me double-check: SANDY – S(✓), A in 2 (allowed), N, D, Y not excluded.

Yes.

Another option is “SALTY” but T is excluded.

“SAGGY” – G, G, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAGGY” to test G and Y.

But to maximize info, maybe “SALTY” is better, but T is excluded.

Next best is “SANDY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.  
Also, A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and S,
- Does not contain R, O, or E,
- Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

A good next guess would be “STASH” because:
- It has S and A,
- It avoids R, O, E,
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in position 4),
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1).

This should give me more information about the positions of S and A and whether any other letters are present.

Guess 2: stash -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- R, O, E are not in the word.

Round 2: stash → S(✓) T(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
- S is correct in position 1 (so the word starts with S).
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, E, T, H.
- S is already locked in position 1.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5 (but S is in 1, so 2,4,5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S already used.

I need a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only allowed letters.

A good next guess is “SCANS”:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 3, but wait – feedback said A is not in position 3. So SCANS is invalid because A is in position 3.

Next option: “SANER” – but E is forbidden.

Next: “SALTY” – but T and Y are allowed, but T is already excluded.

Next: “SWASH” – but H is excluded.

Next: “SANDY” – D and Y are allowed, but let’s check A position: A is in 2 (allowed), word is S A N D Y. No forbidden letters.

But let’s think of a word that maximizes info. “SANDY” checks N, D, Y.

Another option: “SAGGY” – G, G, Y allowed.

But “SAGGY” has A in position 2 (good), and tests G and Y.

Alternatively “SAPPY” – P, P, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAPPY” because it tests P and Y, and A is in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

But wait – let’s check if A is allowed in position 2: yes, feedback only said A is not in 1 or 3.

So “SAPPY” is valid.

But actually, let me think of a word that uses A in position 4 or 5 to see more possibilities. 

“SALSA” – but A is repeated and S is already in 1.

“SASSY” – S is already in 1, and A is in 2, but S is repeated.

“SALTY” – A in 2, T is excluded.

“SANDY” – A in 2, D and Y allowed.

I’ll go with “SANDY” as it tests new letters D and Y, and A is in 2 (allowed).

But let me double-check: SANDY – S(✓), A in 2 (allowed), N, D, Y not excluded.

Yes.

Another option is “SALTY” but T is excluded.

“SAGGY” – G, G, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAGGY” to test G and Y.

But to maximize info, maybe “SALTY” is better, but T is excluded.

Next best is “SANDY”.

Final choice: SANDY.

Guess 3: sandwich -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback on “sandwich” says “Model answer is not five letters,” so I must have used an invalid word.  
I intended to guess “sandwich” but it’s six letters, so I’ll instead use “sand” (but that’s four letters) – no, I need a valid five-letter word.

Let me re-pick a valid five-letter word that fits all constraints so far:

Known facts:
- Word starts with S (from stash feedback).
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 1, 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, E, T, H.
- Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word starting with S, with A in position 2, 4, or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- S A L V A – but V is allowed, but double A might not help.
- S A M B A – but M, B, A – but A is already known.
- S A N D Y – D, Y allowed.
- S A G G Y – G, Y allowed.
- S A M P Y – P, Y allowed.

I’ll choose “SAMPY” to test M and P, with A in position 2.

But to maximize info, perhaps “SANDY” is better.

Final valid word: SANDY.
