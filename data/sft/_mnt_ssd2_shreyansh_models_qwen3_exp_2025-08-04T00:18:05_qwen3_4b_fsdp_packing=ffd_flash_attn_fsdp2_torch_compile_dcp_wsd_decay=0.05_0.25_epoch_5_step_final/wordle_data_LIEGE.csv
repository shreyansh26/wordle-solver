### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

2. From CRUEL:
   - C, R, U are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it must be in position 5, so this simply confirms that).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in position 2).

Therefore:
- Word ends with E.
- Word contains L, and L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, C, R, U.

Possible positions for L: 1 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains L in position 1 or 3, and avoids S, A, T, C, R, U.

Good remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, I, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 1 (since position 3 is also possible but we want to test it here)
- Uses new common letters

A good candidate is “FLAME”:
- F, M, A, L, E
But A is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so FLAME is invalid.

Next candidate: “PHONE”:
- P, H, O, N, E
But no L, so invalid.

Next: “WIELD”:
- W, I, E, L, D
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 4 → but we know L cannot be in position 4 (from CRUEL feedback), so invalid.

Next: “GLOVE”:

- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → but we know L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback), so invalid.

Next: “BLEED”:

- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → again invalid.

Next: “FLEDE” (not a valid word).

Next: “VILEE” (invalid).

Next: “DLEEP” (invalid).

Next: “WHITE”:
- W, H, I, T, E → but T is ruled out.

Next: “BLIME” (not a common word).

Next: “GLIDE”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

- Ends with E
- Has L in position 1 (since position 3 is also possible but we want to test it here)
- Uses new common letters

A good candidate is “FLAME”:
- F, M, A, L, E
But A is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so FLAME is invalid.

Next candidate: “PHONE”:
- P, H, O, N, E
But no L, so invalid.

Next: “WIELD”:
- W, I, E, L, D
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 4 → but we know L cannot be in position 4 (from CRUEL feedback), so invalid.

Next: “GLOVE”:
- G, L, O, V, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → but we know L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback), so invalid.

Next: “BLEED”:
- B, L, E, E, D
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → again invalid.

Next: “FLEDE” (not a valid word).

Next: “VILEE” (invalid).

Next: “DLEEP” (invalid).

Next: “WHITE”:
- W, H, I, T, E → but T is ruled out.

Next: “BLIME” (not a common word).

Next: “GLIDE”:
- G, L, I, D, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “PLUME”:
- P, L, U, M, E → U is ruled out.

Next: “SLEDE” (invalid, S is ruled out).

Next: “FLEE” (only 4 letters).

Next: “WILED” (ends with D, not E).

Next: “GLOVE” already considered.

Next: “PHONE” already considered.

Next: “HOLED” (ends with D).

Next: “BLOKE”:
- B, L, O, K, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “MOMLE” (invalid).

Next: “GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M
- Ends with E
- L is in position 3 → valid (since L can be in position 3)
- Uses new letters G, O, M

GOLEM is a valid English word meaning a creature of legend, and it fits all constraints.

So, my next guess is G O L E M.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - E is fixed in position 5 (✓).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From CRUEL:
   - C, R, U are not in the word.
   - E must be in position 5 (confirms above).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew NOT in position 2).

3. From GOLEM:
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - O is not in the word (x).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (redundant since we know it is in position 5).
   - M is not in the word (x).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: E (fixed at pos 5), L (somewhere not 2, 3, or 4), G (somewhere not 1).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M.
- Remaining possible positions for L: only position 1 is left (since 2, 3, 4 are excluded).
- G must therefore be in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1).

Word pattern so far:
_ _ _ _ E
with L in position 1 (only remaining spot for L), and G somewhere in 2, 3, or 4.

So the word must look like:
L _ _ _ E
and G must appear in position 2, 3, or 4.

We haven’t tested yet: D, H, I, N, P, V, W, Y, F, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with L
- Contains G in position 2, 3, or 4
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M)
- Uses new common letters to identify the remaining spots.

Candidate words:
- LIGNE (invalid, N not tested but word exists; however, we need to check if it fits constraints)
- LIVEN (V not tested, N not tested)
- LIGAN (A is ruled out)
- LIGNE – valid but rare
- LIVEN – valid and common

LIVEN:
- L I V E N
But it’s 5 letters ending in E, with L in position 1, I, V, N new letters.

But we already know L must be in position 1 (only spot left), and E is in 5. So L _ _ _ E.

Looking for common words fitting L _ _ _ E:
- LIVEN – fits
- LIGNE – less common
- LURED – R is ruled out
- LOUSE – O and U ruled out
- LEVER – R and V, but R is ruled out
- LINED – D not tested yet
- LINED:
   - L I N E D – but must end with E, so L I N E ? No, must be L _ _ _ E.

Wait, the pattern is L _ _ _ E, so:
- L I N E ? No, must be L I N E plus one more letter, but it’s 5 letters total.

Actually, the pattern is L _ _ _ E, so positions: L (1), ?, ?, ?, E (5).

Possible words:
- LIVEN – L I V E N – but this ends with N, not E. My mistake, must be L _ _ _ E.

Correct pattern: L _ _ _ E (positions 1 and 5 fixed, 2,3,4 to determine).

Common words:
- LIVEN – invalid, ends with N
- LIGNE – ends with E, but N is in 4, G in 3, I in 2
- LIGNE: L I G N E – fits: L(1) I(2) G(3) N(4) E(5)
   - Checks: L in 1 (allowed), G in 3 (allowed), uses new letters I and N.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: LINED – L I N D E – but D is new, N is new, fits.

Between LIGNE and LINED:
- LIGNE uses I, G, N
- LINED uses I, N, D

Both are valid, but LINED is more common.

I’ll go with LINED.

Check constraints:
- L in position 1 – allowed (only remaining spot for L)
- E in position 5 – correct
- Letters used: L, I, N, D, E
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M)
- G is in the word (from GOLEM feedback) – but LINED does not have G. Oops, mistake!

We know G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from GOLEM feedback). So the word must contain G somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Thus, the word must be L _ G _ E or L _ _ G E or L G _ _ E.

Looking for common words:
- LEGUE – not common
- LIGNE – has G in 3, fits L I G N E
- LIGNE is valid (French loanword in English dictionaries)

Other options:
- LIGMA – M ruled out
- LIGA – too short
- LIGNE seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is LIGNE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in the correct (last) position (✓)

So far we know:
- Word ends with E
- Contains L somewhere, but NOT in position 2
- Does NOT contain S, A, T

Next guess should:
1. Keep the E in position 5
2. Try to place the L in a new spot (positions 1, 3 or 4)
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested

Good candidates: CRUEL, FLEET, GLEAM, BLEED, PLEBE, etc.

I'll choose ""CRUEL"" because:
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 3 (new position)
- Uses C, R, U (untested common letters)
- Avoids S, A, T

<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. From SLATE:
   - E is in the correct position (5th letter).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From CRUEL:
   - C, R, U are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it must be in position 5, so this simply confirms that).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in position 2).

Therefore:
- Word ends with E.
- Word contains L, and L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, C, R, U.

Possible positions for L: 1 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains L in position 1 or 3, and avoids S, A, T, C, R, U.

Good remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, I, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 1 (since position 3 is also possible but we want to test it here)
- Uses new common letters

A good candidate is “FLAME”:
- F, M, A, L, E
But A is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so FLAME is invalid.

Next candidate: “PHONE”:
- P, H, O, N, E
But no L, so invalid.

Next: “WIELD”:
- W, I, E, L, D
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 4 → but we know L cannot be in position 4 (from CRUEL feedback), so invalid.

Next: “GLOVE”:
- G, L, O, V, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → but we know L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback), so invalid.

Next: “BLEED”:
- B, L, E, E, D
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → again invalid.

Next: “FLEDE” (not a valid word).

Next: “VILEE” (invalid).

Next: “DLEEP” (invalid).

Next: “WHITE”:
- W, H, I, T, E → but T is ruled out.

Next: “BLIME” (not a common word).

Next: “GLIDE”:
- G, L, I, D, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “PLUME”:
- P, L, U, M, E → U is ruled out.

Next: “SLEDE” (invalid, S is ruled out).

Next: “FLEE” (only 4 letters).

Next: “WILED” (ends with D, not E).

Next: “GLOVE” already considered.

Next: “PHONE” already considered.

Next: “HOLED” (ends with D).

Next: “BLOKE”:
- B, L, O, K, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “MOMLE” (invalid).

Next: “GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M
- Ends with E
- L is in position 3 → valid (since L can be in position 3)
- Uses new letters G, O, M

GOLEM is a valid English word meaning a creature of legend, and it fits all constraints.

So, my next guess is G O L E M.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - E is fixed in position 5 (✓).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From CRUEL:
   - C, R, U are not in the word.
   - E must be in position 5 (confirms above).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew NOT in position 2).

3. From GOLEM:
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - O is not in the word (x).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (redundant since we know it is in position 5).
   - M is not in the word (x).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: E (fixed at pos 5), L (somewhere not 2, 3, or 4), G (somewhere not 1).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M.
- Remaining possible positions for L: only position 1 is left (since 2, 3, 4 are excluded).
- G must therefore be in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1).

Word pattern so far:
_ _ _ _ E
with L in position 1 (only remaining spot for L), and G somewhere in 2, 3, or 4.

So the word must look like:
L _ _ _ E
and G must appear in position 2, 3, or 4.

We haven’t tested yet: D, H, I, N, P, V, W, Y, F, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:

- Contains G in position 2, 3, or 4
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M)
- Uses new common letters to identify the remaining spots.

Candidate words:
- LIGNE (invalid, N not tested but word exists; however, we need to check if it fits constraints)
- LIVEN (V not tested, N not tested)
- LIGAN (A is ruled out)
- LIGNE – valid but rare
- LIVEN – valid and common

LIVEN:
- L I V E N
But it’s 5 letters ending in E, with L in position 1, I, V, N new letters.

But we already know L must be in position 1 (only spot left), and E is in 5. So L _ _ _ E.

Looking for common words fitting L _ _ _ E:
- LIVEN – fits
- LIGNE – less common
- LURED – R is ruled out
- LOUSE – O and U ruled out
- LEVER – R and V, but R is ruled out
- LINED – D not tested yet
- LINED:
   - L I N E D – but must end with E, so L I N E ? No, must be L _ _ _ E.

Wait, the pattern is L _ _ _ E, so:
- L I N E ? No, must be L I N E plus one more letter, but it’s 5 letters total.

Actually, the pattern is L _ _ _ E, so positions: L (1), ?, ?, ?, E (5).

Possible words:
- LIVEN – L I V E N – but this ends with N, not E. My mistake, must be L _ _ _ E.

Correct pattern: L _ _ _ E (positions 1 and 5 fixed, 2,3,4 to determine).

Common words:
- LIVEN – invalid, ends with N
- LIGNE – ends with E, but N is in 4, G in 3, I in 2
- LIGNE: L I G N E – fits: L(1) I(2) G(3) N(4) E(5)
   - Checks: L in 1 (allowed), G in 3 (allowed), uses new letters I and N.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: LINED – L I N D E – but D is new, N is new, fits.

Between LIGNE and LINED:
- LIGNE uses I, G, N
- LINED uses I, N, D

Both are valid, but LINED is more common.

I’ll go with LINED.

Check constraints:
- L in position 1 – allowed (only remaining spot for L)
- E in position 5 – correct
- Letters used: L, I, N, D, E
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M)
- G is in the word (from GOLEM feedback) – but LINED does not have G. Oops, mistake!

We know G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from GOLEM feedback). So the word must contain G somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Thus, the word must be L _ G _ E or L _ _ G E or L G _ _ E.

Looking for common words:
- LEGUE – not common
- LIGNE – has G in 3, fits L I G N E
- LIGNE is valid (French loanword in English dictionaries)

Other options:
- LIGMA – M ruled out
- LIGA – too short
- LIGNE seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is LIGNE.

Now we have:

2. I is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. E is fixed in position 5 (✓).
4. G is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
5. N is NOT in the word (x).

L I _ _ E

and G must appear in position 4 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by I and G cannot be in 3).

Therefore the word must be:

L I _ G E

We need a letter for position 3 that:
- Has not been ruled out (letters ruled out so far: S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M, N)
- Has not been used yet (used: L, I, G, E)

Possible letters: B, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in the correct (last) position (✓)

So far we know:
- Word ends with E
- Contains L somewhere, but NOT in position 2
- Does NOT contain S, A, T

Next guess should:
1. Keep the E in position 5
2. Try to place the L in a new spot (positions 1, 3 or 4)
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested

Good candidates: CRUEL, FLEET, GLEAM, BLEED, PLEBE, etc.

I'll choose ""CRUEL"" because:
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 3 (new position)
- Uses C, R, U (untested common letters)
- Avoids S, A, T

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. From SLATE:
   - E is in the correct position (5th letter).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From CRUEL:
   - C, R, U are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it must be in position 5, so this simply confirms that).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in position 2).

Therefore:
- Word ends with E.
- Word contains L, and L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, C, R, U.

Possible positions for L: 1 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains L in position 1 or 3, and avoids S, A, T, C, R, U.

Good remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, I, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 1 (since position 3 is also possible but we want to test it here)
- Uses new common letters

A good candidate is “FLAME”:
- F, M, A, L, E
But A is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so FLAME is invalid.

Next candidate: “PHONE”:
- P, H, O, N, E
But no L, so invalid.

Next: “WIELD”:
- W, I, E, L, D
- Ends with E
- Has L in position 4 → but we know L cannot be in position 4 (from CRUEL feedback), so invalid.

Next: “GLOVE”:
- G, L, O, V, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → but we know L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback), so invalid.

Next: “BLEED”:
- B, L, E, E, D
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → again invalid.

Next: “FLEDE” (not a valid word).

Next: “VILEE” (invalid).

Next: “DLEEP” (invalid).

Next: “WHITE”:
- W, H, I, T, E → but T is ruled out.

Next: “BLIME” (not a common word).

Next: “GLIDE”:
- G, L, I, D, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “PLUME”:
- P, L, U, M, E → U is ruled out.

Next: “SLEDE” (invalid, S is ruled out).

Next: “FLEE” (only 4 letters).

Next: “WILED” (ends with D, not E).

Next: “GLOVE” already considered.

Next: “PHONE” already considered.

Next: “HOLED” (ends with D).

Next: “BLOKE”:
- B, L, O, K, E
- Ends with E
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “MOMLE” (invalid).

Next: “GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M
- Ends with E
- L is in position 3 → valid (since L can be in position 3)
- Uses new letters G, O, M

GOLEM is a valid English word meaning a creature of legend, and it fits all constraints.

So, my next guess is G O L E M.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - E is fixed in position 5 (✓).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From CRUEL:
   - C, R, U are not in the word.
   - E must be in position 5 (confirms above).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew NOT in position 2).

3. From GOLEM:
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - O is not in the word (x).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (redundant since we know it is in position 5).
   - M is not in the word (x).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: E (fixed at pos 5), L (somewhere not 2, 3, or 4), G (somewhere not 1).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M.
- Remaining possible positions for L: only position 1 is left (since 2, 3, 4 are excluded).
- G must therefore be in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1).

Word pattern so far:
_ _ _ _ E
with L in position 1 (only remaining spot for L), and G somewhere in 2, 3, or 4.

So the word must look like:
L _ _ _ E
and G must appear in position 2, 3, or 4.

We haven’t tested yet: D, H, I, N, P, V, W, Y, F, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with L
- Contains G in position 2, 3, or 4
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M)
- Uses new common letters to identify the remaining spots.

Candidate words:
- LIGNE (invalid, N not tested but word exists; however, we need to check if it fits constraints)
- LIVEN (V not tested, N not tested)
- LIGAN (A is ruled out)
- LIGNE – valid but rare
- LIVEN – valid and common

LIVEN:
- L I V E N
But it’s 5 letters ending in E, with L in position 1, I, V, N new letters.

But we already know L must be in position 1 (only spot left), and E is in 5. So L _ _ _ E.

Looking for common words fitting L _ _ _ E:
- LIVEN – fits
- LIGNE – less common
- LURED – R is ruled out
- LOUSE – O and U ruled out
- LEVER – R and V, but R is ruled out
- LINED – D not tested yet
- LINED:
   - L I N E D – but must end with E, so L I N E ? No, must be L _ _ _ E.

Wait, the pattern is L _ _ _ E, so:
- L I N E ? No, must be L I N E plus one more letter, but it’s 5 letters total.

Actually, the pattern is L _ _ _ E, so positions: L (1), ?, ?, ?, E (5).

Possible words:
- LIVEN – L I V E N – but this ends with N, not E. My mistake, must be L _ _ _ E.

Correct pattern: L _ _ _ E (positions 1 and 5 fixed, 2,3,4 to determine).

Common words:
- LIVEN – invalid, ends with N
- LIGNE – ends with E, but N is in 4, G in 3, I in 2
- LIGNE: L I G N E – fits: L(1) I(2) G(3) N(4) E(5)
   - Checks: L in 1 (allowed), G in 3 (allowed), uses new letters I and N.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: LINED – L I N D E – but D is new, N is new, fits.

Between LIGNE and LINED:
- LIGNE uses I, G, N
- LINED uses I, N, D

Both are valid, but LINED is more common.

I’ll go with LINED.

Check constraints:
- L in position 1 – allowed (only remaining spot for L)
- E in position 5 – correct
- Letters used: L, I, N, D, E
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M)
- G is in the word (from GOLEM feedback) – but LINED does not have G. Oops, mistake!

We know G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from GOLEM feedback). So the word must contain G somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Thus, the word must be L _ G _ E or L _ _ G E or L G _ _ E.

Looking for common words:
- LEGUE – not common
- LIGNE – has G in 3, fits L I G N E
- LIGNE is valid (French loanword in English dictionaries)

Other options:
- LIGMA – M ruled out
- LIGA – too short
- LIGNE seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is LIGNE.

Now we have:

1. L is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. I is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. E is fixed in position 5 (✓).
4. G is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
5. N is NOT in the word (x).

So the pattern is:

L I _ _ E

and G must appear in position 4 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by I and G cannot be in 3).

Therefore the word must be:

L I _ G E

We need a letter for position 3 that:
- Has not been ruled out (letters ruled out so far: S, A, T, C, R, U, O, M, N)
- Has not been used yet (used: L, I, G, E)

Possible letters: B, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching L I _ G E:

- L I B G E – no such word
- L I D G E – “lidge” is valid (archaic but in some dictionaries)
- L I F G E – no
- L I P G E – no
- L I V G E – no
- L I W G E – no
- L I H G E – no
- L I K G E – no
- L I B G E – no

The only common word left is L I D G E.

Check constraints:
- L, I, E in correct positions (✓)
- G in position 4 (allowed, since it cannot be in position 3)
- D is new and not ruled out
- N is already ruled out, so this fits

Therefore, the next guess is LIDGE.
