### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains A and O, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively. It also does not contain R, S, or E.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep the confirmed letters A and O
2. Move A and O to new positions
3. Introduce new common consonants that haven't been ruled out (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)
4. Avoid R, S, E

A good candidate is ""TALON"":
- T is a new common consonant
- A is moved to position 2
- L is a new common consonant
- O is moved to position 4
- N is a new common consonant

This tests new letters while incorporating the known letters A and O in different positions.

- F A U O N (not valid)
- V A U O N (not valid)
- M A I O N (not valid)

The most straightforward valid word is ""damon"" but it's a proper noun. The other is ""hamon"" which isn't valid. Rechecking: ""damon"" is valid in Scrabble dictionaries but might be obscure. 

Another approach: position 3 could be a vowel. Words like:
- D A I O N (not valid)
- F A U O N (not valid)
- M A I O N (not valid)

The only valid word seems to be ""damon"". However, if we need a more common word, let's reconsider. 

Actually, ""dagon"" is a valid word (a sea god), but G is allowed and not ruled out. But position 3 G and position 1 D: D A G O N.

Checking: D A G O N is valid (Scrabble word list). It uses D and G which are not ruled out.

Thus, ""dagon"" is a strong candidate.

But let's verify: D A G O N fits _ A _ O N pattern, uses D and G not ruled out. 

Therefore, next guess: DAGON.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains A and O, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively. It also does not contain R, S, or E.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep the confirmed letters A and O
2. Move A and O to new positions
3. Introduce new common consonants that haven't been ruled out (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)
4. Avoid R, S, E

A good candidate is ""TALON"":
- T is a new common consonant
- A is moved to position 2
- L is a new common consonant
- O is moved to position 4
- N is a new common consonant

This tests new letters while incorporating the known letters A and O in different positions.

So far we know:

We still need to determine positions 1 and 3. Good candidate letters (not yet ruled out) include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, common consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P.

- H A I O N (not valid)
- M A C O N (not valid)
