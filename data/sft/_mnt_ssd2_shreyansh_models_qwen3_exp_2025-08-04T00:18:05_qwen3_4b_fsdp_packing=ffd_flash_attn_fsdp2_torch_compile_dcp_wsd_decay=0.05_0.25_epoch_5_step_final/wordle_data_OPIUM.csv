### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and no duplicates. This gives us maximum information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Another good option might be ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced choice.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means I should completely avoid those letters in my next guess.  
Looking at common remaining letters: R, I, N, O, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.  
I want a word that uses several of these to maximize information.  
""PRIMO"" uses P, R, I, M, O - none of which were in SLATE.  
This should give good coverage of new letters to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R  
- Letters known to be in the word:
  – I is in the 3rd position (✓)
  – P is in the word but not in 1st position (-)
  – M is in the word but not in 4th position (-)
  – O is in the word but not in 5th position (-)

So the word contains {I, P, M, O} plus one more letter that has not been tested yet.  
Available untested common letters: N, D, U, G, H, K, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Keep I in the 3rd position.
2. Place P, M, O in new positions.
3. Introduce one new untested letter.

Candidate word: “MOUND” won’t work (D is fine, but O is already in 2nd position, and we don’t know if O is allowed in 2nd).  
Try “MOPHY” – uses M, O, P, H, Y. H and Y are fresh.  
But let’s keep I in 3rd: “PIMLY” – but Y is okay, though rare.  
Better: “COMIC” – but C is untested, and we already have I, P, M, O.  
Wait, we need 5 letters total, and we know I, P, M, O are all in. That’s four letters; we need one more.  
So we need a word that is a permutation of I, P, M, O plus one new letter.

Let’s pick a new letter that is common and hasn’t been used: N.  
A valid word: “IMPON” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“MOPIN” – not valid.  
“PIMON” – not valid.  
“OPIUM” – uses O, P, I, U, M. U is untested and valid.  
“OPIUM” is a valid word and uses all known letters (O, P, I, U, M) plus U.

Let’s go with OPIUM.
