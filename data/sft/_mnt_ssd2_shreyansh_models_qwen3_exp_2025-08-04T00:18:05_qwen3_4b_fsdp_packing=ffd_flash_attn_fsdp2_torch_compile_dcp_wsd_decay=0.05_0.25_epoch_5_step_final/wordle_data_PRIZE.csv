### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, E, etc. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and gives good information about vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:

Current constraints:

  – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  – E is in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ E

Remaining unused common letters (excluding banned ones): D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

2. Has E in position 5.
3. Uses only unbanned letters.
4. Uses new letters to test as many remaining common ones as possible.

Candidate words:

- PRIDE (invalid – I and D, but let’s check)
- BRIDE (B is still possible, but we haven’t tested I or D yet)
- FRIZE (Z is uncommon)
- GRIME (G and I and M)
- PRIZE (P, Z, I – but Z is rare)
- TRICE (T is banned)
- CRIME (C is banned)
- BRIBE (B but only tests B once)
- DRUID (U, D, but repeats D)

Current confirmed facts:
1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. R is in position 2.
3. I is in position 3.
4. Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, B, D.

So the pattern is: _ R I _ E

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters that have not been ruled out yet.  
Available letters (excluding banned ones): F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English letters left: F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits _ R I _ E.  
Possible candidates:
- FRIED (but D is banned)
- FRITE (not a common word)
- GRIME (but G and M are allowed, but let’s check if it’s valid)
- PRIED (but D is banned)
- TRIKE (T is banned)
- PRIZE (Z is allowed, but let’s see if it fits the pattern)

Looking at the pattern _ R I _ E:
- FRIZE – but Z is allowed, but is it a common word?
- GRIZE – not common
- PRIZE – P, R, I, Z, E – all allowed letters, and it’s a valid word.

""PRIZE"" fits the pattern P R I Z E and uses only allowed letters.
