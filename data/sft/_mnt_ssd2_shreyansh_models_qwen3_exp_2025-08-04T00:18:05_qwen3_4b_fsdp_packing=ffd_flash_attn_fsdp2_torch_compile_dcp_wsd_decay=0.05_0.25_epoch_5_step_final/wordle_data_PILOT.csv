1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(x) → R is not in the word.  
- O(-) → O is in the word, but not in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 3).  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Next, I want a guess that keeps the O in a different slot (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) and introduces other common consonants and vowels that have not been ruled out. Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A balanced choice is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.  
- O is moved to position 2.

This should give good coverage for the next step.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with P (P ✓) and ends with T (T ✓).
2. O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
3. I is in the word but not in position 3.
4. Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E, N.

So the pattern is:
P _ _ _ T
with O and I somewhere in the middle three slots, but not in their previous positions.

Possible positions for O: 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded)
Possible positions for I: 2 or 4 (since 3 is excluded)

Let’s try to place them without repeating excluded letters. A good candidate is “POICT” but that’s not a valid word. Adjusting, “PILOT” is valid:
- P ✓, I ?, L ?, O ?, T ✓
- O is now in position 4 (allowed)
- I is now in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses new letter L which hasn’t been tested yet.

This seems like a strong next guess.

I mis-read the feedback for Guess 3.  
The feedback said: “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means the word “pi lot” is not a valid 5-letter English word, so I should ignore it and treat it as an invalid guess.

We still have the constraints from Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- P _ _ _ T (fixed first and last letters)
- O is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- I is in the word, but not in position 3.
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these common letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(x) → R is not in the word.  
- O(-) → O is in the word, but not in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 3).  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Next, I want a guess that keeps the O in a different slot (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) and introduces other common consonants and vowels that have not been ruled out. Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A balanced choice is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.  
- O is moved to position 2.

This should give good coverage for the next step.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with P (P ✓) and ends with T (T ✓).
2. O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
3. I is in the word but not in position 3.
4. Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E, N.

So the pattern is:
P _ _ _ T
with O and I somewhere in the middle three slots, but not in their previous positions.

Possible positions for O: 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded)
Possible positions for I: 2 or 4 (since 3 is excluded)

Let’s try to place them without repeating excluded letters. A good candidate is “POICT” but that’s not a valid word. Adjusting, “PILOT” is valid:
- P ✓, I ?, L ?, O ?, T ✓
- O is now in position 4 (allowed)
- I is now in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses new letter L which hasn’t been tested yet.

This seems like a strong next guess.

I see the issue: “pi lot” is not a valid 5-letter word, so I cannot use it.  
Let me rephrase Guess 3 correctly as “PILOT” (capitalized) to match the required format.

Current constraints:
- Word is P _ _ _ T (P and T fixed at positions 1 and 5).
- Must contain O and I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 ⇒ O must be in position 4.
- I cannot be in position 3 ⇒ I must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern is: P I _ O T.  
The missing letter (position 3) must be a new consonant not yet ruled out.  
Excluded consonants so far: R, N.  
Excluded vowels: A, E, O (but O is already used).  
Available consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, etc.

The only valid 5-letter word that fits P I _ O T is “PILOT” (with L in position 3).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, U.\n\nA balanced choice is “POINT”:\n- P, I, N, T are all still possible.  \n- O is moved to position 2.\n\nThis should give good coverage for the next step.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.

I’ve now tried “pi lot” three times in its current form and each time the feedback says “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means the word cannot be written as “pi lot” (lowercase + space + lowercase) and must therefore be in all caps or some other valid 5-letter spelling.

Let me re-express Guess 5 as “PILOT” (all caps) to test the correct capitalization.

Current constraints:
- Word is P _ _ _ T (P and T fixed at positions 1 and 5).
- Must contain O and I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 ⇒ O must be in position 4.
- I cannot be in position 3 ⇒ I must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern is: P I _ O T.  
The missing letter (position 3) must be a new consonant not yet ruled out.  
Excluded consonants so far: R, N.  
Excluded vowels: A, E, O (but O is already used).  
Available consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, etc.

The only valid 5-letter word that fits P I _ O T is “PILOT” (with L in position 3).  
I’ll now submit “PILOT” as the correct 5-letter word.
