### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start with a common, well‑distributed word to get information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E) and spreads them across different positions, which will give useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not present.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N and E are not present.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Has A as the third letter.
2. Contains the letter R, but not at the second position.
3. Excludes the letters C, N, and E.

The word **SHARP** satisfies all constraints:
- Pattern: S H A R P → A is in the third spot.
- R appears in the fourth spot (not position 2).
- It does not contain C, N, or E.

Thus “SHARP” is a valid next guess.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 3 must be **A** (✓ on both guesses).
- Position 4 must be **R** (✓ on guess 2).
- Letter **H** is in the word but not in position 2, so it can be position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, P (all marked x).
Thus we need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ A R _, containing H at position 1 or 5, and using none of the excluded letters.

The word **HOARD** fits perfectly:
- H is at position 1 (allowed).
- O is a new letter to test.
- A is at position 3 (✓).
- R is at position 4 (✓).
- D is another new letter.
No forbidden letters are present.

So the next guess should be “HOARD”.
