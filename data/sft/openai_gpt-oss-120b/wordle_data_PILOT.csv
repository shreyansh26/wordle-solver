### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word.
- From guess 2 (MIGHT): 
  * M is not in the word.
  * I is correct and in the 2nd position.
  * G is not in the word.
  * H is not in the word.
  * T is correct and in the 5th position.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ I _ _ T, using only letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H). A common word that fits this pattern is **PIVOT** (P I V O T), which uses only allowed letters and places I and T in the known correct spots.

So the next guess should be ""PIVOT"".
