### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. It DOES contain the letter N, but N is NOT in the fourth position (since it was marked “-” in position 4 of CRANE). Therefore, the next guess should include N in a different position and avoid the excluded letters. Choosing a word with new letters maximizes information.

The word **BUNKS**:
- Contains N in the 3rd position (different from position 4).
- Introduces new letters B, U, K, S, none of which have been ruled out.
- Is a valid 5‑letter English word.

Thus, BUNKS is a good next guess.

2. BUNKS → B×, U×, N‑, K×, S‑

3. SPOON → S✓, P×, O✓, O‑, N✓  
   → S is correct at position 1, O is correct at position 3, N is correct at position 5.  
   The second O got “‑”, meaning the letter O exists elsewhere, but we already have O at position 3, so the word may contain only one O (the “‑” just tells us O isn’t at position 4).

Thus the known pattern is:

- Position 1: **S**
- Position 3: **O**
- Position 5: **N**
- Positions 2 and 4 are still unknown, using letters not ruled out.

Excluded letters (from X feedback): C, R, A, E, B, U, K, P.  
Allowed letters for the remaining slots include D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word fitting **S _ O _ N** with allowed letters is **SHOWN** (S‑H‑O‑W‑N).

This uses H and W, which have not been excluded, and satisfies all positional constraints.
