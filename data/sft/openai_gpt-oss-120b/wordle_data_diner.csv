### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE, we learned that S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, the next guess must exclude S, L, A, and T, and must place E somewhere other than the fifth slot while introducing new letters to test.
A good candidate is **EDGED**:
- Contains E in positions 1 and 4 (both not position 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

### Response Format:

- Position 4 is definitely the letter **E** (from the second guess, where the fourth E got a ✓).
- The letter **E** is not in positions 1, 5 (from the first guess) and also not in position 1 (second guess), so the only confirmed E is at position 4.
- Letters **S, L, A, T, D, G** are not in the word at all (feedback x or - for those letters).
- We need a new 5‑letter word that places **E** in the fourth slot and uses only letters we have not yet ruled out. 

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and introduces fresh letters is **BRIEF**:
- B, R, I, and F have not been tested yet.
- The pattern is B R I E F, with E correctly in position 4.

Thus, the next guess will be **BRIEF**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
