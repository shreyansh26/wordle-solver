### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a valid 5‑letter word. A good opening guess is a common word that contains a mix of frequent letters (including at least one vowel) to gather information. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it covers the common letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving a broad initial scan of the secret word.

The feedback tells me that the secret word has R in the second position and A in the third position. Letters C, N, and E are not present anywhere in the word. I need a new 5‑letter word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _. I’ll choose a word that doesn’t use C, N, or E and keeps R and A fixed. “GRASP” (G R A S P) satisfies all constraints.
