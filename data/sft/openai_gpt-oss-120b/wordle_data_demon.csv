### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial five‑letter guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give useful feedback. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter because it contains the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

- Letters **in the word**: N and E.
- Positions:
  * N is NOT in position 2 or 4.
  * E is NOT in position 1 or 5.

Thus N can be in positions 1,3,5; E can be in positions 2,3,4.

We need a five‑letter word using N and E in allowed spots and three other letters that are not among the eliminated set.
