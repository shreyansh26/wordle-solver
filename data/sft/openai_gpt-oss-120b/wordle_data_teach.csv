### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess for a 5‑letter word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a variety of common letters and vowels to maximize information for the next steps. ""CRANE"" is a good starter word because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and the two most frequent vowels (A, E).

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1 → could be positions 2,4,5.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is correct at position 3.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5 → could be positions 1,2,4.

Thus the secret word pattern is __A__ with C and E somewhere, not at the prohibited spots, and without R or N.

A word that fits these constraints is **PEACH**:
- P (new letter)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (matches)
- C in position 4 (allowed)
- H (new letter)

This satisfies all known clues, so it’s a good next guess.
