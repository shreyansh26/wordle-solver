### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has R in the second position and E in the fifth position. The letters C, A, and N are not present anywhere. So we need a word of the form _ R _ _ E without using C, A, or N. A common candidate is **BRIDE** (B R I D E), which satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters B, I, D for further clues.

Position 4 is still unknown, but we know P is not in the word (x). Letters eliminated so far are C, A, N, B, D, P. The remaining possible letters for position 4 include any alphabet letter not excluded and that forms a valid English word when placed after “TRI”. The most common candidate is **TRITE** (T R I T E). This uses T again, which is allowed since T is not ruled out from appearing elsewhere, and it yields a real word.
