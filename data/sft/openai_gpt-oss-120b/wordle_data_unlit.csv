### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains the letters N, U, and T, each in the wrong positions indicated:
- N is not in position 3 or 4.
- U is not in position 2.
- T is not in position 4.

All other letters from guesses (C, R, A, E, B, S) are excluded.

A common word that satisfies these constraints and introduces two new letters is **UNTIL**:
- U at position 1 (allowed, not 2)
- N at position 2 (allowed, not 3 or 4)
- T at position 3 (allowed, not 4)
- I and L are new letters not yet ruled out.

Thus, “UNTIL” is a valid next guess.
