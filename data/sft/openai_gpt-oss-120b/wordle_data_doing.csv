### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. ""SLATE"" is a good starter because it includes S, L, A, T, and E, which are common in English words and will give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

The feedback indicates that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new guess that avoids those letters entirely and uses common letters to gather more information. A good candidate is ""MOUND"", which uses M, O, U, N, and D—none of which have been ruled out yet.

We know from feedback:
- O is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 4.
- D is in the word but not at position 5.
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, M, U are not in the word.

So the pattern is _ O _ N _. D must be at position 1 or 3 (since not 5). A word that fits is **DOING** (D O I N G): D at position 1, O at 2 (✓), I unknown, N at 4 (✓), G unknown, and D is not in position 5, satisfying the D(-) clue. No excluded letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be ""DOING"".
