### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- C is third (correct).
- A is fourth – a new possible spot for A.
- New letters V, O, L have not been tried and are not ruled out.
Thus it will give us more information about the remaining letters.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the pattern of the secret word:

- Position 2: O (from VOCAL, ✓)
- Position 3: C (✓)
- Position 4: A (✓)
- Position 5: L (✓)

So the word is _ O C A L. The only letters not yet ruled out for position 1 are those not marked x in previous feedback. Eliminated letters are R, N, E, P, T, S, V, and also any others from earlier guesses. Viable candidates are **LOCAL** and **FOCAL**. Both fit the pattern, and neither F nor L have been excluded. 

I'll guess **LOCAL** to test the remaining unknown letter. If it's correct we solve the puzzle; if not, the feedback will tell us whether the first letter is F, allowing us to guess FOCAL next.

Position 1 cannot be L (dash) and cannot be any letters marked x previously: R, N, E, P, T, S, V, etc. The plausible English words fitting _OCAL are ""FOCAL"" and ""BOCAL"".
