### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, vowel‑rich 5‑letter word to get useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” is a good starter because it contains a mix of common consonants (C, R, N) and two different vowels (A, E). This should give me a solid base for the first round of feedback.

- Letters C, N, E, F, L, I are not in the word.

We need a new word with A in the third slot, R in a possible slot (1 or 4), and avoiding the eliminated letters.  
The word **SHARP** fits:
- Pattern _ _ A R _ (R at position 4, allowed).
- Uses new letters S, H, P that haven’t been ruled out.
