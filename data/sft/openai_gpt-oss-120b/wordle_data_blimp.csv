### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- M, I, P, L are all in the word (each shown as “-” in previous feedback).
- Y, C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T are definitely not in the word.

Positional constraints from earlier guesses:
- M is NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- I is NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- P is NOT in position 3.
- L is NOT in position 4.

A valid next guess should place these four known letters in positions that respect the constraints, while adding a new, unused letter to fill the fifth spot.  

One word that satisfies all constraints is **PLIMS**:
- P 1 (allowed, not position 3)
- L 2 (allowed, not position 4)
- I 3 (allowed, I is not in 1 or 2)
- M 4 (allowed, M is not in 1 or 2)
- S 5 (new letter, not previously ruled out)

“PLIMS” is an English word (plural of “plim”), so it is a legal guess and will give new information about the exact positions of the letters.

We have determined from the last feedback that the secret word has L in position 2, I in position 3, M in position 4, and contains P but not at position 1. Therefore P must be at position 5. The pattern is _ L I M P. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **BLIMP**, with B at position 1 (B has not been ruled out). This guess will confirm the final letter.
