2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all, while E is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E somewhere other than the fifth spot.
- Introduce new letters to test possibilities.

A good candidate is **HEIST**: it contains E in the second position and adds H, I, S, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,N are not in the secret word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From HEIST: H is in the word but not in position 1; E is correct at position 2; I and T are not in the word; S is correct at position 4.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ E _ S _, with letters H, E, S already known to be present. H cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 5. We need a valid English word matching this pattern and using new letters to test other possibilities while respecting the eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,I,T).

The word **WELSH** fits perfectly:
- Position 1: W (new, not eliminated)
- Position 2: E (correct)
- Position 3: L (new)
- Position 4: S (correct)
- Position 5: H (places H away from position 1)

All letters are allowed, and it adheres to the known constraints.
