### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 3 = A
- Position 4 = S
- Position 5 = E
S cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from earlier feedback), and we know S is at position 4.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, N, L, T, U, G, P, H, plus any others marked x. So remaining usable letters for positions 1 and 2 are: A, B, D, F, I, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and maybe others not yet tried).

We need a common English word of the form __ASE. The only plausible candidates with allowed letters are:
- ABASE (A B A S E): uses letters A (allowed), B (allowed). No excluded letters.

Thus we guess ABASE.
