### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Letters C, R, E, L, I are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (so A can be 2, 4, or 5).
- N is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (so N can be 1, 2, or 3).
- G is in the word but not in position 4 (so G can be 1, 2, 3, or 5).

A word that respects all these placements and uses only allowed letters is **GANDY**:
- G at position 1 (allowed),
- A at position 2 (allowed),
- N at position 3 (allowed),
- D and Y are new letters to test other spots and are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “GANDY” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- G is correct at position 1.
- N is correct at position 3.
- A is in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.

- Y and the letters C, R, E, L, I are not in the word.

Thus the word pattern must be:

with A occupying either position 4 or 5, and D occupying either position 2 or 5 (but not 4).  

Choosing a real word that fits these constraints and introduces a new letter to test, “GONAD” works:
G O N A D – G is in the correct spot, N is correct, A is at position 4 (allowed), D at position 5 (allowed), and O is a new letter to probe.
