### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter word. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter.

We have the pattern from feedback: position 2 is L, A is in the word but not in position 3, and letters S, T, E are not in the word. So the secret word looks like _ L _ _ _. A must be in position 1, 4, or 5. Choosing a word with A in position 1 and new letters helps narrow possibilities. “ALBUM” fits the pattern (A L B U M) and introduces three new letters (B, U, M) while respecting all known constraints.

We know the second letter is L (✓).  
Letters not in the word: S, T, E, B, U, M.  
Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, so it must be in position 4 or 5.  

We need a word of form ? L ? ? A (if A is fifth) or ? L ? A ?.  
A suitable common word that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **FLORA** (F L O R A):  
- L is second (✓).  
- A is fifth (allowed).  
- Contains none of the excluded letters (S, T, E, B, U, M).  
Thus FLORA is a valid next guess.
