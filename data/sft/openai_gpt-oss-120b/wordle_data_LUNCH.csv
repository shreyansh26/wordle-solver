2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.

- R, A, and E are not in the word.

I need a new 5‑letter word that contains C and N, avoids R, A, E, and places C and N in positions different from those ruled out.  
“LINCH” fits:
- Contains C (position 4, acceptable) and N (position 3, acceptable).
- No R, A, or E.
- Uses common letters for extra information.

We have determined the secret word pattern: L ? N C H, with L at position1, N at position3, C at position4, H at position5. The only unknown is the second letter, which cannot be R, A, E, I, or any letters already ruled out. A common word fitting this pattern is ""LUNCH"". This uses U, which hasn't been eliminated yet.
