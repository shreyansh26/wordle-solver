### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and different vowel/consonant positions. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes S, L, A, T, E, giving information about frequent letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and E are not in the word.
- L, A, and T are in the word but are in the wrong positions (L not 2nd, A not 3rd, T not 4th).

We need a 5‑letter word containing L, A, T plus two other letters, avoiding S and E, and placing L, A, T in different positions than they appeared in SLATE.

The word **LATIN** fits:
- Contains L, A, T.
- L is in position 1 (not 2), A in position 2 (not 3), T in position 3 (not 4).
- Adds I and N, which we have no information about yet.
- No S or E.

Thus LATIN is a valid next guess.

We have letters confirmed in the word: L, A, T, I (all present but not in the positions they occupied in previous guesses). Excluded letters: S, E, N.

Constraints:
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4.

A word that fits these constraints and uses L, A, T, I plus another letter is **TRIAL**:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- R is a new filler letter.
- I is in position 3 (allowed; I only banned from position 4).
- A is in position 4 (allowed; A only banned from positions 2 and 3).
- L is in position 5 (allowed; L only banned from positions 1 and 2).

All constraints are satisfied and no excluded letters appear.
