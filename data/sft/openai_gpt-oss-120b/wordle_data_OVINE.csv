### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word ends with N in position 4 and E in position 5. Letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word fitting the pattern ___NE, using only letters we haven’t ruled out. “PHONE” matches this pattern (P‑H‑O‑N‑E) and introduces three fresh letters (P, H, O) while keeping N and E in the correct spots. This will give us more information.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A are not in the word; N is correct in position 4, E is correct in position 5.
- From guess 2 (PHONE): P and H are not in the word; O is in the word but not in position 3; N and E remain correct in positions 4 and 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N E, with O somewhere in positions 1 or 2 (but not 3). No letters C, R, A, P, H are allowed.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in “NE” that contains O in position 1 or 2 and uses none of the forbidden letters. “OVINE” fits perfectly:
- O is at position 1,
- V and I are new letters,
- N and E are already correct in positions 4 and 5,
- No prohibited letters appear.

So the next guess should be OVINE.
