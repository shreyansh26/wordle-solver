### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess indicates that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need to choose a new five‑letter word that does not contain any of those letters. I’ll pick a common word with entirely different letters to continue gathering information.

We have these constraints from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I are NOT in the secret word.
- Letters G, H, T are correct and in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively (✓).
Thus the word pattern is __GHT.

We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern without using any excluded letters. The word **OUGHT** fits perfectly:
- Positions: O (1), U (2), G (3), H (4), T (5)
- Uses only allowed letters (O and U are not excluded).
Therefore “OUGHT” is a valid next guess.
