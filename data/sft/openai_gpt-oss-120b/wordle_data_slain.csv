### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the third position.
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (so N can be 1st, 2nd, or 5th).

We need a five‑letter word with A at position 3, containing N in a position other than 4, and avoiding C, R, and E. “PLAIN” fits: P L A I N (A is third, N is fifth, no C/R/E). This will give us new information about the remaining letters.

We have derived the known positions:
- Position2 = L (✓ from PLAIN)
- Position3 = A (✓ from both guesses)
- Position4 = I (✓ from PLAIN)
- Position5 = N (✓ from PLAIN)

Thus the word pattern is _ L A I N. The first letter must be a valid English letter not previously ruled out (C, R, E, P are out). The common word that fits is ""SLAIN"". This uses S, which hasn't been excluded.
