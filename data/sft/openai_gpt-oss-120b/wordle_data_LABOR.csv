### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and A in different spots, avoids C, N, E, and introduces some new letters to test.

We have the following information:

- From CRANE: C, N, E are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus far we know the secret word:
- Position 2 = **A**
- Contains **R** somewhere in positions 3‑5 (not 1 or 2)
- Contains **L** somewhere not in position 4 (so positions 1,3,5 are possible)
- The remaining two letters must be chosen from letters not yet ruled out (e.g., V, O, etc.) and must avoid the excluded set {C, N, E, I, S}.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **VALOR**:
- V A L O R
- Position 2 is A (confirmed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- R is in position 5 (allowed, not positions 1 or 2).
- New letters V and O have not been tested yet and are not in the excluded list.
