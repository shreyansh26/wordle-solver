### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains the letters L and T, but:
- L is not in positions 2 or 3.
- T is not in positions 1 or 4.

All other letters guessed so far (S, A, E, U, I, P) are not in the word.

To gain more information while respecting these constraints, I’ll guess a word that includes L and T in different positions from those ruled out, and introduces new letters for testing. “CLOTH” places:
- L in position 2 (which we know is wrong, so it should give a “‑”),
- T in position 4 (which we know is wrong, so it should give an “x”),
- and adds the new letters C, O, and H for further clues.

This guess respects all known exclusions and will help narrow down the remaining possibilities.
