### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter English word that can give useful information about vowels and common consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N). This should provide a solid base for the next guesses based on the feedback.

We know the secret word fits the pattern _ _ A _ E (A is correct at position 3, E is correct at position 5). Letters C, R, and N are confirmed not in the word. We need a new word that respects the known positions and introduces fresh letters to test. “SLATE” matches the pattern (S L A T E) and adds three new letters (S, L, T) while keeping A and E in their confirmed spots. This will give clear information about the remaining unknown letters.

We know the secret word pattern is _ _ A _ E.
Confirmed letters: A at position 3, E at position 5.
Letter L is in the word but not at position 2 (feedback showed L(-) in SLATE, where L was in position 2).
Forbidden letters (not in the word): C, R, N, S, T, plus from first guess also C,R,N and from second S,T.
We need a word that fits the pattern, includes L (not in position 2), and avoids the forbidden letters.
A good candidate is **LEAVE**:
- Positions: L (1), E (2), A (3), V (4), E (5)
- Keeps A at 3 and E at 5.
- Places L at position 1 (valid, not position 2).
- Introduces new letters E (already known) and V (new, not forbidden).
All letters are allowed, so this guess will give new information.
