### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the exact positions for three letters:
- Position 1: H (✓ from HOWDY)
- Position 2: O (✓ from HOWDY)
- Position 5: Y (✓ from HOWDY)

Positions 3 and 4 are still unknown, but we know the letters W and D are not in the word (both got x). All previous guesses have eliminated many other letters (C,R,A,N,E,S,L,U,M,P,F,I,G,T,W,D). The remaining letters that have not been ruled out are B, J, K, Q, V, X, Z (and any letters not yet tried). 

A common English word fitting the pattern H O _ _ Y and using only allowed letters is **HOBBY** (H O B B Y). The letters B have not been tested yet, and using them will give us information about the remaining positions without violating any known exclusions.

Thus the next logical guess is HOBBY.
