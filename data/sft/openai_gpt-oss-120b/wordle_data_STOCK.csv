### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me:
- C is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So I need a word that contains C (not as the first letter) and avoids R, A, N, E. I’ll choose a common word with new letters to gather more info. “SCOUT” places C in the second spot and introduces S, O, U, T, all of which are still possible.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 3 is O (✓).
- C is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 (‑ on guess 2, and not in position 1 from guess 1). So C can be position 4 or 5.
- T is in the word but not in positions 1,3,5 (‑ on guess 2). So T can be position 2 or 4.
- Letters R, A, N, E, U are not in the word.
We need a 5‑letter word starting with S, third letter O, containing both C and T, respecting the position limits, and using only allowed letters for the remaining spot.

A good candidate is **STOCK**:
- S (position 1) ✓
- T (position 2) allowed (T can be here)
- O (position 3) ✓
- C (position 4) allowed (C can be here)
- K (position 5) a new letter not yet ruled out
Thus STOCK satisfies all known constraints.
