# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”.
  • R cannot be in position 2.
  • A cannot be in position 3.
  • E cannot be in position 5.
- N is not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that starts with C, contains R, A, and E in different positions respecting those restrictions, and does not contain N.

A good candidate is **CATER**:
- C is fixed at position 1.
- A moves to position 2 (allowed).
- R moves to position 5 (allowed, not position 2).
- E moves to position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- The extra letter T is acceptable and N is absent.

Thus “CATER” satisfies all known constraints.
