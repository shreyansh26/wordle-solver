### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **E** (from NEXUS and TENET).
- Position 4 is also **E** (both E's in TENET were marked correct).
- Position 5 is **N** (N cannot be 1,2,3,4; thus it must be 5).
- Letter **S** is known to be in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 3.
- The remaining unknown position (position 3) can be any allowed letter not yet excluded.

Considering the allowed letters (all letters except those marked absent: C, R, A, J, O, Y, X, U, T, etc.), the word **SEVEN** fits perfectly:
- S at position 1 (allowed, satisfies S not at 5)
- E at positions 2 and 4 (confirmed)
- V at position 3 (unused and not excluded)
- N at position 5 (forced)

Thus the next guess should be **SEVEN**.
