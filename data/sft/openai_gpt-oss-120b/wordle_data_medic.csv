### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE we know:
- S, L, A, T are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (the position it occupied in SLATE).

Therefore the next guess should:
1. Exclude S, L, A, T.
2. Include the letter E, but not at position 5.
3. Test new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “GREEN”:
- Contains E (positions 3 and 4, both different from position 5).
- Introduces new letters G, R, N.
- No prohibited letters appear.

We have determined that the only possible position for the letter E is the second slot, because:
- From SLATE, E is in the word but not at position 5.
- From GREEN, both Es are in the word but not at positions 3 or 4.
- From EPOXY, E is in the word but not at position 1.
Thus E must be at position 2.

All other letters tried so far (S, L, A, T, G, R, N, P, O, X, Y) are not in the word.

We need a new word with E in the second position and four new letters that have not been eliminated. “MEDIC” fits:
- Pattern M E D I C places E correctly at position 2.
- Introduces fresh letters M, D, I, C, none of which have been ruled out.
This will give us more information about the remaining four positions.

Hence the next guess is MEDIC.
