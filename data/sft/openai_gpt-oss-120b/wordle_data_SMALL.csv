### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:
- Position 1 is S (from SWAMP with ✓).
- Position 3 is A (from both guesses with ✓).
- Letter M is in the word but not in position 4 (from SWAMP with – at position 4).
- Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, R, N, E, W, P.
Thus the pattern is S _ A _ _. M must be either in position 2 or 5.

A word that fits these constraints is **SMALL** (S‑M‑A‑L‑L):
- Position 1 = S (✓).
- Position 2 = M (places M in a non‑forbidden spot).
- Position 3 = A (✓).
- Positions 4 and 5 are L, new letters not yet tested and not among the excluded set.
The word satisfies all known constraints, so we will guess it.
