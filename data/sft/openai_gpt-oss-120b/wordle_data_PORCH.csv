### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined from the third guess LURCH that letters R, C, H are correct and in the exact positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively, giving the pattern __RCH. Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters that have not been ruled out by earlier feedback (A, N, E, I, K, S, L, U are all excluded). The word “TORCH” fits this pattern, using T and O, which have not been eliminated, and forms a valid English word.

The feedback shows that positions 2-5 are O, R, C, H respectively. Position 1 is not T and hasn't been any of the eliminated letters (A, N, E, I, K, S, L, U, T). The common English word fitting the pattern _ORCH is ""PORCH"", where P is not among the eliminated letters. This is a valid guess.
