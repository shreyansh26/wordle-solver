### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 3: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed positions:
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Position 1 is still unknown, but it cannot be any letters that have been marked as absent: C, R, A, L, D, S, H, plus the letters already placed (O,N,E,Y). The most common word that fits the pattern _ O N E Y is ""MONEY"". The letter M has not been ruled out, so we can try that.

We have determined the fixed letters: position 2 O, position 3 N, position 4 E, position 5 Y are correct. The first letter must not be any letter marked x: C, R, A, L, D, S, H, M, and also cannot be O, N, E, Y because those are already placed (and duplicates are unlikely). The remaining plausible common word fitting the pattern _ O N E Y is ""BONEY"". This uses B, which hasn't been ruled out, and forms a valid English word meaning ""of bone"". Therefore the next guess should be BONEY.
