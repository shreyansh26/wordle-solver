### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- T is correct in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word with T at the fourth slot, containing S in a different position (2, 3, or 5), and avoiding L, A, and E.

A good candidate is **RUSTY**:
- Pattern _ _ _ T _ fits (T is fourth).
- Contains S in position 3.
- Uses only new letters R, U, Y which we have no information about yet.
- Avoids the excluded letters L, A, E.

Thus the next guess will be RUSTY.
