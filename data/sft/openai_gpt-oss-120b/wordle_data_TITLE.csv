### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess **CRANE** we learned:
- **C, R, A, N** are not in the secret word at any position.
- **E** is correct and in the 5th position.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have gathered the following information:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) and **L** is in position 4 (from WHILE: L ✓, E ✓).
- The letter **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (WHILE gave I - at position 3), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters (marked x) are: C, R, A, N, S, O, P, W, H, plus the letters from previous guesses that are not present anywhere: C,R,A,N,S,O,P,W,H.
- Therefore the remaining unknown letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet (B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc.) and must fit the pattern **_ I _ L E** or **I _ _ L E**.

A common English word that fits these constraints is **BIBLE**:
- Pattern: B I B L E (L at position 4, E at position 5, I at position 2).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B is still unknown).

Thus ""BIBLE"" is a logical next guess.

We have determined the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 5 is **E** (confirmed).
- Position 4 is **L** (confirmed).
- Position 2 is **I** (confirmed).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, S, O, P, W, H, B** are not in the word.
- Position 1 and 3 are still unknown but must be letters not excluded yet.
- The pattern is **_ I _ L E**.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **TITLE** (T‑I‑T‑L‑E). It introduces a new letter **T** in positions 1 and 3, which are still open, and follows all known constraints.
