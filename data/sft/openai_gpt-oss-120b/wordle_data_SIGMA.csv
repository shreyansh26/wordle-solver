### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C, R, N, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. SALTY → S is correct in position 1; A is in the word but not in position 2; L, T, Y are not in the word.
3. SODAS → S is correct in position 1; O, D are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 4; the second S is in the word but not in position 5.

From this we know:
- Position 1 = **S**
- Position 5 = **A** (A cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4)
- The word contains no letters C, R, N, E, L, T, Y, O, D.
- All remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set {A, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, S}.

A common English word fitting the pattern **S _ _ _ A** with only allowed letters is **SHIVA** (S‑H‑I‑V‑A). It satisfies all constraints:

- Starts with S, ends with A.
- No prohibited letters are used.
- Contains only one S (the “‑” feedback on the extra S can be interpreted as “S exists elsewhere”, which is true).

Therefore the next guess should be “SHIVA”.

1. CRANE → C, R, N, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. SALTY → S is correct in position 1; A is in the word but not in position 2; L, T, Y are not in the word.
3. SODAS → S is correct in position 1; O, D are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 4; the second S is in the word but not in position 5.

From this we know:
- Position 1 = **S**
- Position 5 = **A** (A cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4)
- The word contains no letters C, R, N, E, L, T, Y, O, D.
- All remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set {A, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, S}.

A common English word fitting the pattern **S _ _ _ A** with only allowed letters is **SHIVA** (S‑H‑I‑V‑A). It satisfies all constraints:

- Starts with S, ends with A.
- No prohibited letters are used.
- Contains only one S (the “‑” feedback on the extra S can be interpreted as “S exists elsewhere”, which is true).

Therefore the next guess should be “SHIVA”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
