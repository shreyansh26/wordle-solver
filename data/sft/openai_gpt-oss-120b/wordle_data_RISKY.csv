### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I'll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters to gather useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E).

We know only R is present from the first guess, but not in position 2. All other letters C, A, N, E are not in the word. The next guess should contain R in a different position (1,3,4,5) and use fresh letters to test other possibilities while avoiding the excluded ones. “RUSTY” places R at position 1 and introduces U, S, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out yet.

From the feedback:
- Guess 1 eliminated C, A, N, E.
- Guess 2 gave: R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓).

Thus the secret word has R in position 1, S in position 3, Y in position 5, and does not contain U, T, C, A, N, E.  
We need a word matching the pattern **R _ S _ Y** using only unused letters.  
“RISKY” fits perfectly (R I S K Y), introducing I and K, which have not been ruled out.
