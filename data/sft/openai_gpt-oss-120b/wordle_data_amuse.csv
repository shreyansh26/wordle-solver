### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- E is correct at position 5.
- L and T are not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E, containing S and A in positions other than those prohibited, and without L or T. “RAISE” fits:
- R A I S E → ends with E,
- A is in position 2 (not 3),
- S is in position 4 (not 1),
- no L or T present.
Thus “RAISE” is a logical next guess.

From the feedback:
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 4 is S (✓ from second guess).
- Letters L, T, R, I are not in the word (x).
- Letter S is present but not in position 1 (‑) – already placed correctly at position 4.
- Letter A is present but not in positions 2 or 3 (‑ in both guesses), so A must be in position 1.
Thus the pattern is **A _ _ S E**.  
Possible words fitting this pattern and using only letters not ruled out include **AMUSE** and **ABUSE**. I’ll guess “AMUSE” to test the middle letters.
