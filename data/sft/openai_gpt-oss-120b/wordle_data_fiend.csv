### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is correct and in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Thus the secret word has the pattern ___N_, includes an E somewhere in positions 1‑3, and must not contain C, R, or A.

A valid word meeting these constraints is **SPEND**:
- N is the fourth letter.
- E is the third letter (not fifth).

We have deduced the secret word pattern from the feedback:

- From guess 1, N is correct at position 4, and E is somewhere else (not position 5).
- From guess 2, positions 3, 4, 5 are E, N, D respectively (✓), confirming the pattern **__END**.
- Letters C, R, A, S, P are not in the word.
- The first two letters must be any letters other than those excluded and not already used in the correct positions.

A common word fitting **__END** is **BLEND** (B and L are unrestricted). This satisfies all constraints.

Thus the next guess should be “BLEND”.
