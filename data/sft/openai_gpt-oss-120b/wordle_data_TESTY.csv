### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a 5‑letter word that:
1. Has E at position 2.
2. Contains T (not at position 5).
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

The word **SETUP** satisfies all constraints:
- Position 2 is E.
- T is at position 3 (allowed).
- The remaining letters S, U, P have not been ruled out.
Thus it will give new information about T’s exact spot and the other letters.

We have determined:
- E is definitely in position 2 (the only spot left after previous clues).
- T is in the word but not in positions 3, 5, and not in position 2 (occupied by E). So T can be at position 1 or 4.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, B, L, D, I, G, H, S, U, P, and also from earlier guesses any other single‑instance letters that got an “x”.
- Remaining unused letters include O, M, Y, V, W, Q, Z, K, F, J, X.

A word that fits the known pattern (E in slot 2, T somewhere else) and introduces new letters is **TEXTY**:
- Positions: T E X T Y
- E is correctly placed at position 2.
- T appears in positions 1 and 4, satisfying that it is not at 3 or 5.
- X and Y are new letters that can give further information.

Thus the next guess will be TEXTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

- Position 3: X is not in the word, and the only remaining unknown slot is position 3.
- Position 4: T is correct (✓).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **T E _ T Y**.

The only letter not yet placed is for position 3. Earlier feedback from the guess “SETUP” gave **S(-)**, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. Position 3 is the only open spot, so S belongs there. The resulting word is **TESTY**, which aligns with all previous clues and does not contain any eliminated letters.

Therefore the next guess should be the full word “TESTY”.
