### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From MIGHT: M,I,G,H are not in the word; T is correct in position 5.
- From BOOST: B is not in the word; O at position 2 is correct (✓); the second O is in the word but not at position 3 (-); S at position 4 is correct (✓); T at position 5 is correct (✓).

Thus the secret word ends with **_ O _ S T**.  
The second O being marked “-” tells us there is at least one O elsewhere; the O at position 2 is already correct, so the other O must be at a different position (most likely position 1). However, variations sometimes mark extra occurrences as “-” even if there is only one O, so we keep the pattern flexible: the word is **_ O _ S T** with letters already ruled out.

We need a common 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern and avoids all excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,B).  
**JOUST** matches:
- J (new letter)
- O at position 2 (✓)
- U (new letter)
- S at position 4 (✓)
- T at position 5 (✓)

All letters are allowed, so JOUST is a logical next guess.
