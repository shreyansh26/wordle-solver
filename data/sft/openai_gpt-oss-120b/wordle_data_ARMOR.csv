### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a variety of common letters and both vowels and consonants, to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular starting guess in Wordle because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two vowels and three frequent consonants.

- The second R in the word is not in position 3 (‑) and cannot be in positions 1 or 4, so it must be in position 5. Hence position 5 = R.
- The secret pattern is A R _ O R.

We need a 5‑letter word fitting A R ? O R, using a new letter for position 3 that hasn't been ruled out. The word **ARBOR** (A‑R‑B‑O‑R) matches this pattern, introduces the unused letter B, and avoids all letters known to be absent (C, N, E, T, U, L, Y, W).

The only unknown is position 3. From prior guesses we know:

- Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, T, U, L, Y, W, B.
- The unknown letter cannot be A, R, or O (already used in fixed positions).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
