### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes frequent letters C, R, A, N, E and will give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

We know from the feedback that:
- The first letter is C (correct position).
- The letter R is not in the word.
- The letter N is not in the word.
- The letter A is in the word but not in position 3.
- The letter E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must be of the form C _ _ _ _. It must contain A and E somewhere other than those forbidden spots, and must avoid R and N.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **CADET**:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A (in position 2, which is allowed).
- Contains E (in position 4, which is allowed).
- Uses no R or N.

Thus CADET is a logical next guess.

We have determined the constraints:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- Position 5 is T (✓).
- The word contains A (not in positions 2 or 3) → must be position 4.
- The word contains E (not in positions 4 or 5) → can be position 2 or 3.
- No R, N, D.

The only common English word fitting C _ _ A T with E at position 3 is **CHEAT** (C‑H‑E‑A‑T). This satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter H to test further.

Thus the next guess should be CHEAT.
