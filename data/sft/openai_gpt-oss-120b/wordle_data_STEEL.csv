### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (BLESS): B is not in the word; L is in the word but not in position 2; E is correct in position 3; S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

So far the word must contain:
- E at position 3.
- L somewhere other than position 2.
- S somewhere other than positions 4 and 5.
- No letters C, R, A, N, B.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **SHELF**:
- Position 1 = S (allowed, not 4 or 5).
- Position 2 = H (doesn’t conflict with any rule).
- Position 3 = E (matches the known correct position).
- Position 4 = L (L is not in position 2, so this is fine).
- Position 5 = F (allowed).

All letters are distinct from the excluded set, and the placements respect the feedback.

Thus the word pattern is **S _ E _ L**, with L fixed at position 5.
