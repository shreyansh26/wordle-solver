### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes both a vowel and several frequently occurring consonants, which should give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the feedback that the third letter is A and the letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.  
So the next guess must have A in position 3 and avoid using C, R, N, and E anywhere.  
Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints gives us “SWAMP” (S‑W‑A‑M‑P). It meets all requirements.

We have determined the exact positions for four of the five letters:

- Position 1: S (✓ from SWAMP)
- Position 3: A (✓ from both guesses)
- Position 4: M (✓ from SWAMP)
- Position 5: P (✓ from SWAMP)

The only unknown is position 2. Eliminated letters are C, R, N, E, W (all marked x). The remaining valid letters include any that haven’t been ruled out. The common English word fitting the pattern S?AMP is **STAMP**, with T in the second position, which hasn’t been excluded.

Thus the next logical guess is “STAMP”.
