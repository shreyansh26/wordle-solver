### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, O, U, T, S, P, I.

- R is in the required third position
- G (new, not eliminated)
- E matches the known final letter

This guess will confirm whether V and G belong in the word and also checks if a second E is possible.

From the feedback:
- Position 2 = E (✓)
- Position 3 = R (✓)
- Position 4 = G (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)
- V is not in the word.

Thus the secret pattern is **_ E R G E**.  
We need a valid 5‑letter word matching that pattern and using a letter not yet ruled out for the first position. ""MERGE"" fits perfectly (M is still possible). This guess will confirm whether M is the correct first letter.
