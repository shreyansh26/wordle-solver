### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T are not in the secret word. L is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was first in LIGHT and got “-”). So L must be in positions 2‑5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains L not as the first letter.
- Uses only letters that are not ruled out: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Choose a word that introduces several new possible letters while keeping L in a non‑first position. “FOULS” (F O U L S) satisfies these conditions:
- L is fourth, not first.
- F, O, U, S are all still possible.
Thus it’s a good next guess.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Secret word starts with **F** (F is correct in position 1).
- **O** is in the word but not in position 2.
- **L** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (and also not position 1 from earlier). So L can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T, U, S, plus any duplicates of those.
We need a five‑letter word beginning with F that contains both O and L in allowed spots, using only letters not eliminated. “FLOOD” fits:
- Position 1 = F (correct).
- Position 2 = L (allowed, L not in position 1).
- Position 3 = O (O is allowed here, not position 2).
- Position 4 = O (O can be here).
- Position 5 = D (D is still a possible letter).
