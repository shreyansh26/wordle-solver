### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter P is in the secret word and is correctly placed at positions 3 and 4 (both P’s received ✓).
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ A P P _.

Potential candidates that match “_AP P_” and use only allowed letters include words like **DAPPS** (D A P P S). Both D and S have not been ruled out, and the word satisfies the known pattern.

We have confirmed:
- A is correct at position 2 (✓).
- P is correct at positions 3 and 4 (✓).
- All other letters tried (C,R,N,E,L,B,U,M,H,Y,D,S) are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is _ A P P _. The remaining letters (positions 1 and 5) must be from the alphabet excluding the eliminated letters. Viable candidates include words that consist only of A and P in those positions, such as “PAPPA”. This uses only allowed letters (P and A) and fits the pattern perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need a new word that:
1. Contains A in one of the allowed positions.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ A P P _.  
The only remaining unknown letters are the first and fifth positions, and they must be chosen from letters that have not been eliminated.

Potential candidates that match “_AP P_” and use only allowed letters include words like **DAPPS** (D A P P S). Both D and S have not been ruled out, and the word satisfies the known pattern.

We have deduced the pattern from the feedback:

- Position 2 is A (confirmed by HAPPY).
- Positions 3 and 4 are P (confirmed by HAPPY).
- Position 5 is A (confirmed by PAPPA).
- Position 1 is not P (P gave a “-” at position 1) and cannot be A (A was ruled out from position 1 earlier). It also cannot be any letters that have received an “x”: C, R, N, E, L, B, U, M, H, Y, D, S.

The remaining unused letters that could occupy position 1 are: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

A common English word that fits the pattern _ A P P A with one of those letters is **KAPPA** (the Greek letter). No other plausible English word fits the constraints.

Thus the next guess should be KAPPA.
