### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess (CRANE) tells me that the only correct letter is E in the 5th position. All other letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all. So the next guess must end with E and must avoid using C, R, A, N. I’ll choose a word that introduces new letters while keeping the known correct placement. “SLIDE” satisfies these requirements: it ends with E, and its other letters (S, L, I, D) have not been tested yet.

We have confirmed letters:
- E is correct at position 5.
- I is correct at position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (from the “-” feedback on the first letter of SLIDE). Therefore S must be in position 2 or 4.

All letters marked “x” cannot appear: C, R, A, N, L, D.

We need a word matching the pattern _ _ I _ E with S in position 2 or 4 and no forbidden letters. The word **GUISE** fits:
- G (new)
- U (new)
- I (correct at position 3)
- S (position 4, satisfying the “-” clue)
- E (correct at position 5)

Thus the next guess is GUISE.
