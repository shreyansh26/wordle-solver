### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- The second letter is R (correct position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word fits the pattern: _ R _ _ _.  
We need a valid 5‑letter word with R as the second letter, containing A somewhere other than the third position, and avoiding C, N, and E.

A good candidate is **ARROW**:
- A is in the first position (satisfies “A not in third”).
- R is correctly placed in the second position.
- No C, N, or E appear.
- It’s a common English word.
