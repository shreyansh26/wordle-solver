### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the vowel A and the common letters C, R, N, and E, which will give useful information about the secret word.

From the first feedback:
- C and R are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E**, contains **A** and **N** somewhere in the first four spots, but A cannot be third and N cannot be fourth. I need a new 5‑letter word satisfying those constraints and avoiding C and R.

“ANGLE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- N is in position 2 (allowed).
- G and L are new letters to test.
Thus it’s a good next guess.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, G, L are not in the word.
- The word ends with E.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.
- N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E that contains both A and N, respecting those position limits and avoiding the eliminated letters.  
The word **NAIVE** fits:
- N is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only new letters I and V besides the known ones.
