### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word must contain the letters B (position 1) and N (position 4) from the feedback on BRINK (B✓, N✓). All letters marked with “x” are ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, W, M, P, H, F, I, X, K.  

The feedback “U(-)” from UNFIX tells us U is in the word but not in position 1, and “Y(-)” from NYMPH tells us Y is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore the remaining letters to place are U and Y (plus possibly one more filler letter).  

We need a five‑letter word of the form **B _ _ N _** that includes U and Y in positions other than the excluded ones.  
The word **BUNNY** fits perfectly:
- B is at position 1 (✓).
- N is at position 4 (✓) and also appears at position 3, which does not conflict with any feedback.
- U is at position 2, satisfying “U not in position 1”.
- Y is at position 5, satisfying “Y not in position 2”.
- No prohibited letters are used.

Thus BUNNY is a consistent candidate for the secret word.
