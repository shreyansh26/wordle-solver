### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O are not in the secret word.
- Letter T is correct and in the 5th position.
- Letter S is in the word but not in the 4th position (it was guessed at position 4 in “GHOST”).

Thus the secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ T with S in one of the first three positions.  
We need a common 5‑letter word using only allowed letters (any except the eliminated ones) that satisfies this pattern.

A good candidate is **SPLIT**:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, not position 4).
- P, L, I are unused letters and have not been eliminated.
- T is in position 5, matching the known correct placement.

Therefore the next guess will be “SPLIT”.
