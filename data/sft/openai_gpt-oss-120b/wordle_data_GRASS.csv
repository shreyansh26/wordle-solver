From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct and in position 2.
- A is correct and in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word looks like _ R A _ _.  
We need a common five‑letter word with R in the second slot and A in the third, avoiding C, N, and E.  
“GRASP” fits: G R A S P, and none of its letters have been ruled out.
