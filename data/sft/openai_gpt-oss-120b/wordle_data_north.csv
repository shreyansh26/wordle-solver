### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters, such as “CRANE”. This will give information about several common vowels and consonants.

We know:
- Letters C, A, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and places R and N in positions different from those excluded.

A good candidate is **UNRIG**:
- Contains R and N.
- R is in position 3 (not position 2).
- N is in position 2 (not position 4).
- Uses only letters U, N, R, I, G, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus we’ll guess UNRIG.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letter **R** is correct at position 3 (from UNRIG feedback).
- Letter **N** is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4 (from both guesses). So N can be at position 1 or 5.
- Letters **C, A, E, U, I, G** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with R in the third slot and N in either the first or last slot, using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is **NORTH**:
- Positions: N (1), O (2), R (3), T (4), H (5)
- N is at position 1 (allowed), R is at position 3 (confirmed), and O, T, H have not been eliminated.

Thus we will guess “NORTH”.
