### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Letters S, T, G, D are not in the word at any position.

Thus the word is of the form _ L A _ E, with the first and fourth letters being something other than S, T, G, D, and not L, A, or E unless they repeat.

Possible candidates include BLAME, FLAME, CLARE, BLARE, etc. To test new letters efficiently, I’ll choose a word that introduces two new, common letters. “FLAME” adds F at position 1 and M at position 4, both of which have not been tried yet.

### Game Rules:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have confirmed the first, second, third, and fifth letters as F, L, A, and E respectively (all ✓). The fourth letter is still unknown; we know it is not M (tried in FLAME) and not K (tried in FLAKE). No other letters have been ruled out for that position.

The pattern is **F L A _ E**. A common English word matching this pattern is **FLARE**, where the fourth letter is R, a letter we have not yet tested. This guess will tell us whether R is the correct fourth letter.
