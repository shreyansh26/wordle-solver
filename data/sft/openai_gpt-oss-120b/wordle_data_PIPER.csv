### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain R and E in other positions, avoid C, A, N, and can include any other letters.

I need a valid 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints. “BERET” works:
- Contains R (position 3) – not position 2.

We have the feedback:

- From BERET: B and T are not in the word. The E at position 4 is correct (✓). The E at position 2 and the R at position 3 are both present elsewhere (‑).  

Thus the secret word must contain an E at position 4, contain an R (not at positions 2 or 3), and avoid the letters C, A, N, B, T.  

A common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints is **RIVER**:
- Position 1 = R (R is present, not at 2 or 3)
- Position 4 = E (matches the ✓)
- No prohibited letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “RIVER”.

- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain R and E in other positions, avoid C, A, N, and can include any other letters.

I need a valid 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints. “BERET” works:
- Contains R (position 3) – not position 2.
- Contains E (positions 2 and 4) – not position 5.
- Does not contain C, A, or N.

So I’ll guess “BERET”.

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R is in the word but not at position 2. E is in the word but not at position 5.
- From BERET: B and T are not in the word. The E at position 4 is correct (✓). The E at position 2 and the R at position 3 are both present elsewhere (‑).  

Thus the secret word must contain an E at position 4, contain an R (not at positions 2 or 3), and avoid the letters C, A, N, B, T.  

A common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints is **RIVER**:
- Position 1 = R (R is present, not at 2 or 3)
- Position 4 = E (matches the ✓)
- No prohibited letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “RIVER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the exact known letters:

- Position 4 = E (✓)
- Position 5 = R (✓)

All other letters tried so far are excluded: A, B, C, M, N, S, T, V, W, plus the letters that received an “x” at any position (C, A, N, B, T, V, W, M, S).  
The remaining unknown positions are 1 and 3, and they cannot be any of the excluded letters or R (since the only R is at position 5).

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern **_ I _ E R** using only allowed letters. Viable English words fitting this pattern include:
- FILER
- PILER
- LIKER
- HIDER
- PIKER
- FIFER

All are possible, but we must choose the most likely common word. “FILER” is a regular, common word and uses two previously untested letters (F and L), giving us a good chance of hitting the solution on the final guess.

- Position 4 = E (✓)
- Position 5 = R (✓)

All other letters tried so far are excluded: A, B, C, M, N, S, T, V, W, plus the letters that received an “x” at any position (C, A, N, B, T, V, W, M, S).  
The remaining unknown positions are 1 and 3, and they cannot be any of the excluded letters or R (since the only R is at position 5).

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern **_ I _ E R** using only allowed letters. Viable English words fitting this pattern include:
- FILER
- PILER
- LIKER
- HIDER
- PIKER
- FIFER

All are possible, but we must choose the most likely common word. “FILER” is a regular, common word and uses two previously untested letters (F and L), giving us a good chance of hitting the solution on the final guess.

Therefore the next guess is “FILER”.",Guess 6: FILER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
