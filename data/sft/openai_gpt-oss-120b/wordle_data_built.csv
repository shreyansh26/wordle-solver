### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- M is not in the word.

Thus the secret word looks like _ _ _ _ T and must contain I somewhere other than the second slot. All letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H are ruled out.

We have the following confirmed letters from the last feedback:

- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: T (✓)

Position 1 is still unknown. The letter Q was marked (x), so it cannot be Q. All previously ruled‑out letters are C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, S, P, and Q. The only plausible common word that fits the pattern _ U I L T is **BUILT** (B U I L T). B has not been eliminated and the word is a valid English word, so it is the best next guess.
