### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that covers a variety of common letters and vowel placements. “CRANE” includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good spread for the first guess.

We know the secret word has C in the first position and R in the second position. Letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a five‑letter English word starting with “CR”. To gather more information about the remaining three letters, I’ll choose a common word that introduces new letters not yet ruled out.

We have confirmed the first two letters: C (position 1) and R (position 2). The letters A, N, E, U, S, H are ruled out entirely. We need to determine letters for positions 3‑5 using only letters not yet excluded. Choosing a word that introduces new letters will give us more information. “CROWD” fits the pattern C R ?, ?, ? and adds O, W, D, none of which have been tried or excluded. It’s a valid common English word, so it’s a good next guess.
