### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does **not** contain the letters C, A, N, or E.  
The letter **R** is in the word but cannot be in the 2nd position (its position in “CRANE”).  
So our next guess must:
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Include R, placed somewhere other than the 2nd slot.
- Use other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is **LURID** (L‑U‑R‑I‑D): it avoids the forbidden letters, places R in the 3rd position, and introduces four new letters for testing.
