### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the Wordle-style game with an initial guess. A good opening word uses common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gain information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it contains the frequent letters C, R, A, N, E and includes two common vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the first guess ""crane"" we learned:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the secret word (marked x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (marked –).

Thus the secret word must contain N in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, and must avoid C, R, A, E entirely.

I need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Includes N in an allowed position,
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is **M I N D S**:
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- None of the letters M, I, D, S have been ruled out yet.
- The word is a common English word, giving useful new information.

So I will guess ""minds"".

We have the following feedback:
- From guess 1 (crane): C, R, A, E are not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From guess 2 (minds): M, D, S are not in the word; N is correct at position 3; I is in the word but not in position 2.

So far:
- N must be in position 3 (✓).
- I must be somewhere other than position 2; possible positions are 1, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, M, D, S.
- Allowed letters (so far): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N already placed.

We need a common 5‑letter word with N third, containing I (not in position 2), and using only allowed letters. The word **FUNG I** fits:
- Pattern: F U N G I → N is third, I is fifth (not position 2).
- Uses only allowed letters (F, U, G, I) and does not include any excluded letters.
- It’s a valid English word.

Thus the next guess should be “fungi”.
