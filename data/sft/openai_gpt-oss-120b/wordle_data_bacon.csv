### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it tests several frequent letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good information for the next steps.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- R and E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes C, A, N in different positions respecting those constraints, and avoids R and E.  
A good candidate is **MANIC**:
- M A N I C
- C is at position 5 (not 1) ✅
- A is at position 2 (not 3) ✅
- N is at position 3 (not 4) ✅
- No R or E present ✅

Thus “MANIC” satisfies all known information and is a valid English word.

We have these constraints from previous feedback:
- A is correct at position 2.
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (so it must be 3 or 4).
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (so it must be 1 or 5).
- Letters R, E, M, I are not in the word.

A word that satisfies all of these is **BACON**:
- B A C O N
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- C is at position 3 (allowed).
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are present.

Thus BACON is a valid next guess.
