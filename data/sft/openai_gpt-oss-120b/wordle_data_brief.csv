### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 2 must be R (✓).
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5, so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that respects these constraints. “TRIED” fits:
- R is in position 2.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Contains none of the excluded letters C, A, N.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed positions:
- Position 2 is R (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 3 is I (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 4 is E (✓ from guess 2).

Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, T, D.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ R I E _. The remaining letters cannot be any of the excluded ones. A common English word fitting this pattern is **BRIEF** (B R I E F), which uses only allowed letters and satisfies all known constraints.
