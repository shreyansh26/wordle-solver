### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word‑guessing game with any valid 5‑letter English word. A common starter that covers a mix of common letters is ""CRANE"". This will give a good spread of vowels and consonants for the first feedback.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- N is correct and locked in the 4th position.

So the secret word pattern is ___N_. I need a new guess that has N in the fourth spot and avoids the letters C, R, A, and E. A good candidate is **STING** (S‑T‑I‑N‑G), which fits the pattern and introduces new letters for testing.

We know:
- N is correct in the 4th position (from CRANE and STING).
- T is in the word but not in the 4th position (from STING's '-' on T).
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, E, S, I, G.
We need a 5‑letter word with N at position 4, containing T elsewhere, and avoiding the eliminated letters.  

Word **BLUNT** fits:
- Pattern: B L U N T → N is 4th.
- T appears in position 5 (not 4th), satisfying the “‑” for T.
- Uses new letters B, L, U (still unknown) and none of the prohibited letters.

Thus BLUNT is a valid next guess.
