### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- CRANE: all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the word.
- LIGHT: L is in the word but not in position 1; I,G,H,T are not in the word.
- SLUMP: L is in the word but not in position 2; S,U,M,P are not in the word.
- JOLLY: J is not in the word; O is in the word but not in position 2; the first L (position 3) is not correct; the second L (position 4) is correct; Y is correct at position 5.

Thus we know:
- Position 4 = L (✓)
- Position 5 = Y (✓)
- O is somewhere in the word, but not position 2.
- L is in the word (already accounted for at position 4); it is not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- All letters C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T, S, U, M, P, J are eliminated.

Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The pattern is `_ _ _ L Y` with O in either position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be 2,4,5). Position 1 = O fits nicely, leaving positions 2 and 3 to be letters not yet ruled out. A common English word that matches `O D D L Y` satisfies all constraints: O (position 1), D (positions 2 and 3) are unused letters, L is at position 4, Y at position 5.

Therefore the next guess should be **ODDLY**.
