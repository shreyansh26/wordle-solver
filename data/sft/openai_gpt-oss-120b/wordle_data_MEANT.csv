### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since there is no prior information, I will choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, and E, which will give useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

We know from previous feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2.
- Letters C, R, L, D are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is: _ E A N _

We need a valid five‑letter word fitting that pattern and using letters not ruled out. Possible candidates include **MEANT**, **BEANS**, etc. Choosing a word that introduces two new letters will give the most information, so I will guess **MEANT**.
