### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, E, B, L are not in the secret word.
- A is correct at position 2.
- N is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4 (from both guesses). Therefore N can only be at position 1 or 5.
Thus the pattern is either N A _ _ _ or _ A _ _ N.

Choosing a common word that fits the pattern and avoids the excluded letters, “NASTY” (N A S T Y) satisfies all conditions:
- A is at position 2.
- N is at position 1 (not 3 or 4).
- No prohibited letters are used.
