### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word’s pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 3 is **A** (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 5 is **E** (✓ from both guesses).
- Letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5. The only remaining slot is position 4, so R → position 4.
- Letters **C, N, O, T** are not in the word at all.

Thus the word looks like: _ _ A R E.

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common possibilities include **FLARE, GLARE, BLARE, SHARE** etc. Choosing **FLARE** introduces two new letters (F and L) that have not been tested yet, giving us the most information.

Therefore the next guess is “FLARE”.

- Position 3 is **A** (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 5 is **E** (✓ from both guesses).
- Letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5. The only remaining slot is position 4, so R → position 4.
- Letters **C, N, O, T** are not in the word at all.

Thus the word looks like: _ _ A R E.

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common possibilities include **FLARE, GLARE, BLARE, SHARE** etc. Choosing **FLARE** introduces two new letters (F and L) that have not been tested yet, giving us the most information.

Therefore the next guess is “FLARE”.

- Position 3 = A (confirmed from all guesses).
- Position 4 = R (confirmed from guess 3).
- Position 5 = E (confirmed from all guesses).

Letters ruled out so far: C, N, O, T, F, L.  
R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from earlier feedback), which is consistent with it being in position 4.

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters not yet eliminated.  
A good candidate is **SHARE**, which fits the pattern and introduces two new letters (S and H) that have not been tested.

Thus the next guess is “SHARE”.

We have determined the pattern _ _ A R E with confirmed letters:
- A in position 3 (✓)
- R in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)

Eliminated letters from previous guesses: C, N, O, T, F, L, S, H, and also R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from earlier “-” feedback).  

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters that have not been ruled out.  
Possible common words fitting the pattern are **AWARE** (A W A R E) and **QUARE** (Q U A R E).  
Both use only letters not yet eliminated, and they introduce new letters for testing.

Choosing **AWARE** gives us two new letters (W and the repeated A) and keeps the pattern consistent.
