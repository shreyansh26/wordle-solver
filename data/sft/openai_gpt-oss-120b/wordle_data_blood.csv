### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I’ll choose a commonly used 5‑letter word that has a mix of consonants and vowels to give useful information about letter presence and positions. “CRANE” is a good starter word.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed not to be in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters and introduces fresh letters to test more possibilities. Choosing “GHOST” gives me five new letters (G, H, O, S, T) that could provide useful information.

We have confirmed letters: O is correct in position 3 (from GHOST). All other letters from previous guesses (C,R,A,N,E,G,H,S,T) are not in the secret word. We need a new word with O as the third letter and using only letters not yet ruled out. Possible candidates include FLOOD, BLOOM, BLOOD, etc. I’ll choose BLOOD to test B, L, and D while keeping O in the correct spot.
