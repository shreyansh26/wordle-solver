### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Letters known not to be in the word: C, A, N, O, B, D, T, M, (and any others marked x).

The pattern is _ I _ E R.  
We need a valid word that fits this pattern using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates include **LIVER** and **GIVER**. Both satisfy the pattern and introduce only new letters (L, V or G, V). Choosing **LIVER** gives us new letters L and V to test while keeping the known correct letters in place.

Thus the next guess will be “LIVER”.

We have the current confirmed pattern from the feedback:

- Position 3: V (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

So the secret word must be of the form _ I V E R.

Letters that have been ruled out (marked x) are: C, A, N, O, B, D, T, M, L.  
The only remaining common letter that can occupy the first position is G (or possibly other letters not yet tested, but G yields a known English word).

The word **GIVER** fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and introduces the new letter G for testing.

Thus the next guess should be GIVER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 4 = E (✓)
- Position 5 = R (✓)

Possible English words matching _IVER and using an allowed first letter are limited. ""FIVER"" uses F, which has not been ruled out, and fits the pattern. ""RIVER"" would place R at position 1, but earlier feedback gave R(-) at position 1, so R cannot be there. Thus ""FIVER"" is the logical next guess.
