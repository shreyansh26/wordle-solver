### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess SLATE:
- S, A, T are not in the word.
- L and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (L not in position 2, E not in position 5).

We need a new guess that includes L and E in different positions, and introduces three new letters while avoiding S, A, T.

A good candidate is **LEMON**:
- L moves to position 1 (allowed).
- E moves to position 2 (allowed, since only position 5 is ruled out for E).
- Introduces new letters M, O, N which have not been ruled out yet.

Thus this guess will test the correct spots for L and E and give information about the new letters.
