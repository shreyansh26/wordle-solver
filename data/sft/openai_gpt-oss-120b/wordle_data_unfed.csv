### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does not contain S, L, A, or T. It does contain an E, but not at the 5th position (since SLATE placed E at 5 and got “-”).

- The secret word has **E in position 4**.
- Letters **S, L, A, T, R, O, V, Q, N** are not in the word.
- Letter **U** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
Thus the remaining possible letters are B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, U, W, X, Y, Z.

To gather more information, I will make a guess that:
- Keeps **E at position 4**,
- Uses only allowed letters,
- Introduces several new letters (Z, I, P, D) while not repeating any already‑tested excluded letters,
- Does not need to include U this time, since we already know it’s present.

A suitable word is **ZIPED** (Z I P E D).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
