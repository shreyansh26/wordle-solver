### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- The secret word has S at position 3 (✓) and Y at position 5 (✓).
- There is another S somewhere else (the second S got a “-”), so the word contains at least two S’s. Since position 3 already holds an S, the other S must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters eliminated so far: L, A, T, E, M, O.
Thus the pattern is: (S or ? ) (S or ?) S (not S) Y, with the first two positions possibly holding the second S.

A good candidate that respects all constraints and introduces a new letter (I) is **SISSY** (S I S S Y). This keeps S in position 1 (testing the other S location), has S correctly placed at 3, retains Y at 5, and adds the new letter I for further information.

- Position 1 cannot be S, L, A, T, E, M, O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need a new 5‑letter guess that includes S (not at position 1) and avoids L, A, T, E. A good candidate is **MOSSY**: it contains S in positions 3 and 4, and none of the excluded letters appear.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- The secret word has S at position 3 (✓) and Y at position 5 (✓).
- There is another S somewhere else (the second S got a “-”), so the word contains at least two S’s. Since position 3 already holds an S, the other S must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters eliminated so far: L, A, T, E, M, O.
Thus the pattern is: (S or ? ) (S or ?) S (not S) Y, with the first two positions possibly holding the second S.

A good candidate that respects all constraints and introduces a new letter (I) is **SISSY** (S I S S Y). This keeps S in position 1 (testing the other S location), has S correctly placed at 3, retains Y at 5, and adds the new letter I for further information.

- There is at least one more **S** somewhere else in the word, but it is **not** in position 1 or 4 (the feedback gave “-” for the S’s in those spots).

- Position 4 cannot be S, L, A, T, E, M, O.

Thus the pattern so far is: **_ I S _ Y**.

A common English word matching this pattern and respecting all exclusions is **W I S P Y**.

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters (W at position 1 and P at position 4) while keeping the already‑confirmed letters in place.

- Letters L, A, T, E, M, O, W, P are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not at position 1.
