### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback that the secret word ends with the letter **E** (position 5). The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all, so we must avoid them in the next guess. I’ll choose a new 5‑letter word that ends with E and uses fresh common letters to gather more information.

We have the following confirmed positions from feedback:
- Position 2: L (correct)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

So the secret word fits the pattern _ L O _ E.

Letters definitively NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, P (and also the first letters of “CRANE” and “SLOPE” that were marked x).  

We need a 5‑letter word matching the pattern, using only letters not ruled out. Potential candidates include **GLOBE**, **GLOVE**, **BLOKE**, etc.  
Choosing **GLOBE** lets us test the new letters G and B while keeping the known correct letters in place.

Thus the next guess is:
