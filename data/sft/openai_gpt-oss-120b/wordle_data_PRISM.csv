### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 is R (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 4 is S (✓ from guess 2).

Forbidden letters (not in the word at all):
C, A, N, E, T, U (from feedback x).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R _ S _. We need to fill positions 1,3,5 with letters not in the forbidden list and also not violating any known constraints.

Choose a word that keeps R and S fixed and introduces new letters to test possibilities. “PRISM” fits the pattern (P R I S M) and adds three fresh letters (P, I, M) that have not been ruled out.

So the next guess is:
