### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:

- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and A, excludes C, N, E, and places R and A in positions other than 2 and 3 respectively.

The word **RAILS** satisfies all these constraints:

- Position 3: B (✓)

Letter I is in the word but not in position 4 (from the feedback on RABID where I was in position 4 and got a “-”). Therefore I must be in the remaining open slot, which is position 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: R A B _ I.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern using only letters not already excluded (C, N, E, L, S, D are out). The word **RABBI** fits perfectly:

- All other excluded letters are absent.
