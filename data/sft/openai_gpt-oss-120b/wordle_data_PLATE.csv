### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the pattern _ L A T E with confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = L (✓)
- Position 3 = A (✓)
- Position 4 = T (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)

All other letters guessed so far (C, R, N, B, D, F, M, S) are marked x, so the first letter cannot be any of those.

Common English words fitting the pattern are:
- PLATE
- ELATE
- ALATE

Choosing PLATE introduces a new, untested letter P in the first position, which will tell us if P is the correct first letter.

Thus the next guess will be ""plate"".
