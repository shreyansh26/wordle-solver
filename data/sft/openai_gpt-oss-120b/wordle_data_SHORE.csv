### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to give useful feedback for future guesses. “SLATE” includes S, L, A, T, and E, which are frequent in English words.

We know the secret word starts with S and ends with E. The letters L, A, and T are confirmed not present anywhere. To gather more information, I need a word fitting the pattern S _ _ _ E without using L, A, or T. “SHINE” fits: S at position 1, H I N in the middle, E at position 5, and none of the excluded letters appear.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: H (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

Letters proven absent: L, A, T, I, N.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S H _ _ E**.  
We need to determine the two middle letters. Viable common words include:
- SHORE (adds O and R)
- SHOVE (adds O and V)

Both O and R/V have not been ruled out. I’ll test SHORE first to check O and R.
