### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE the feedback tells us:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the secret word must contain R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

Choosing a common 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints, I select **RUMOR**:
- Contains R (twice) and places R at positions 1 and 5, avoiding position 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (U, M, O).

We have the following information from previous feedback:
- The secret word does **not** contain the letters: C, A, N, E, U, M.
- The letter **R** is in the word. It is correct at position 1 (R✓) and it is also present elsewhere, but not at positions 2 or 5 (R‑ at those spots). Therefore the word contains **at least two R’s**, with the second R possible at positions 3 or 4.
- The letter **O** is in the word but not at position 4 (O‑). It could be at positions 2, 3, or 5.
- No other letters have been confirmed or ruled out yet.

To gather more information we need a guess that:
1. Keeps the confirmed R at position 1.
2. Places O somewhere other than position 4 (e.g., position 2).
3. Introduces new letters to test additional possibilities while avoiding the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is **ROILS**:
- R stays at position 1 (already known green).
- O moves to position 2 (allowed and tests O’s exact location).
- I, L, S are new letters that have not been ruled out, giving us fresh clues.

This guess respects all constraints and will help determine the exact spots for O, the second R, and the status of I, L, and S.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.
