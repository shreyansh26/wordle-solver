### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern:
- Position 1: L (confirmed)
- Position 2: I (confirmed)
- Position 4: E (confirmed)
- Position 5: N (confirmed)

Only position 3 remains unknown. Letters ruled out so far: S, A, T, M, O, V, K. The remaining letters can be any other alphabet character not yet excluded.

A common English word fitting the pattern L I _ E N is **LINEN**, where the middle letter is N. N is already known to be in the word (at position 5), and there is no rule preventing it from appearing twice. No other trial has disproved N in position 3.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""LINEN"".
