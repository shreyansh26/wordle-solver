### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not at position 5. For the next guess we should place E in a different position and introduce new letters while avoiding the known absent letters. “SMELT” puts E at position 3 and uses new letters S, M, L, T, which could give us more information.

From the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓ from SMELT).
- Position 3 is E (✓ from SMELT).
- Position 4 is L (✓ from SMELT).
- Letters C, R, A, N, M, T are not in the word (x).
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).

So the pattern is S _ E L _. The remaining letters must avoid the excluded ones. A common word fitting this pattern is **SHELF**, with H in position 2 and F in position 5, both of which have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be SHELF.

Choosing “SPELL” will test whether P belongs in the word; if it’s wrong, the feedback will show P as absent, narrowing the solution.
