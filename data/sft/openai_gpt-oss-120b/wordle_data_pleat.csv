### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter word. A good opening guess is a common word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to give useful information. “SLATE” is a frequent starter in these types of games because it includes S, L, A, T, and E, covering two vowels and three common consonants. I’ll use that as my first guess.

We have constraints:
- L must stay in position 2 (confirmed by both guesses).
- Letters A, T, E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses:
  * A cannot be in positions 1 (from ALTER) or 3 (from SLATE); thus A can be 4 or 5.
  * T cannot be in positions 3 (from ALTER) or 4 (from SLATE); thus T can be 1 or 5.
  * E cannot be in positions 4 (from ALTER) or 5 (from SLATE); thus E can be 1 or 3.
- Letters S and R are not in the word.

The word **BLEAT** fits all these constraints:
- B L E A T → L is correctly at position 2.
- E is at position 3 (allowed for E).
- A is at position 4 (allowed for A).
- T is at position 5 (allowed for T).
- No prohibited letters (S, R) appear.

- L is correct at position 2.
- A, T, E are in the word but in different positions (A not 3, T not 4, E not 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word with L in the second slot, containing A, T, and E elsewhere, and no S.  
The word **ALTER** fits:
- Positions: A (1), L (2), T (3), E (4), R (5)
- L is correctly placed.
- A, T, E are present but not in the positions they were guessed previously.
- No prohibited letters.

Thus “ALTER” satisfies all known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(-) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ALTER -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) T(-) E(-) R(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have constraints:
- L must stay in position 2 (confirmed by both guesses).
- Letters A, T, E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses:
  * A cannot be in positions 1 (from ALTER) or 3 (from SLATE); thus A can be 4 or 5.
  * T cannot be in positions 3 (from ALTER) or 4 (from SLATE); thus T can be 1 or 5.
  * E cannot be in positions 4 (from ALTER) or 5 (from SLATE); thus E can be 1 or 3.
- Letters S and R are not in the word.

The word **BLEAT** fits all these constraints:
- B L E A T → L is correctly at position 2.
- E is at position 3 (allowed for E).
- A is at position 4 (allowed for A).
- T is at position 5 (allowed for T).
- No prohibited letters (S, R) appear.

Thus BLEAT is a consistent next guess.

The only unknown is the first letter. It must be a valid English letter that hasn't been ruled out. The letters eliminated so far are B, S, and R (plus any others that appeared as “x”). 

The word pattern is _ L E A T. A common English word fitting this pattern is **CLEAT** (a type of shoe or fastening). The leading letter C hasn't been excluded, making “CLEAT” a suitable next guess.
