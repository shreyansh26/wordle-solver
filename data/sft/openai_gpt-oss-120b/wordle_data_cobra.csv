### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good opening guess is a word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. 
""CRANE"" includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E, covering a broad set of letters. 
This should provide a solid base for the next steps based on the feedback.

We know from the feedback:
- C is correct at position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not at position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- N and E are not in the word (x).

We need a 5‑letter word starting with C, containing R and A in different positions from those ruled out, and avoiding N and E.

The word **CARGO** fits:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A at position 2 (allowed, since A only can’t be position 3).
- Contains R at position 3 (allowed, since R can’t be position 2).
- No N or E.

Thus “CARGO” is a valid next guess.

We have the following information:

- Position 1 is definitely **C**.
- The secret word contains the letters **R**, **A**, and **O**, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in the previous guesses:
  * **R** is not in positions 2 or 3 → it can be in 4 or 5.
  * **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 → it can be in 4 or 5.
  * **O** is not in position 5 → it can be in 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters **N, E, G** are not in the word.
- We need one more letter (position 2‑5) that hasn’t been ruled out.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **COBRA**:
- C (pos 1) matches the known correct letter.
- O is in position 2 (allowed for O).
- B is a new letter (not yet ruled out).
- R is in position 4 (allowed for R).
- A is in position 5 (allowed for A).

Thus **COBRA** is a valid next guess.
