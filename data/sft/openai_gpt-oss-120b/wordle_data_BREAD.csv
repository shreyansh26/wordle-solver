### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I'll start with a common, vowel‑rich word to get information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” is a good first guess because it contains two common consonants (C, R) and three common vowels (A, N, E). This should reveal useful clues for the next steps.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must:
- Have R as the second letter.
- Contain A (somewhere other than position 3) and E (somewhere other than position 5).
- Exclude the letters C and N entirely.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **BREAD**:
- Pattern: B R E A D fits R in position 2.
- A is in position 4 (not 3) and E is in position 3 (not 5).
- No C or N are present.

Thus we will guess BREAD.
