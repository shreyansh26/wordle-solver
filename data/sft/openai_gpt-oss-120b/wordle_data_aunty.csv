### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain A and N, placed elsewhere. We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes A and N, avoids C, R, E, and introduces fresh letters to gather more information. “SALON” fits: it has A (position 2, not 3) and N (position 5, not 4), and adds S, L, O for testing.

We have confirmed letters:

All other letters tested (C, R, E, S, L, O) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain A and N, placed in the remaining possible slots:
- A can be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
- N can be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

A valid guess should include A and N in allowed positions and introduce three new letters that have not been ruled out (any letters except C, R, E, S, L, O).  

The word **ANIMA** satisfies all constraints:
- A in positions 1 and 5 (both allowed).
- N in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters I and M, which have not been tested yet.
- No prohibited letters appear.
