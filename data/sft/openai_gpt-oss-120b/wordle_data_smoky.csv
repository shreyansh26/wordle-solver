### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have the confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (green)
- Position 2: M (green)
- Position 3: O (green)

From the last guess (SMOGS) we saw:
- G is gray, so not in the word.
- The second S (position 5) was yellow, meaning the secret word contains an S elsewhere (it could be the same S we already have at position 1, depending on how the feedback handles duplicates). To keep possibilities open, we’ll assume the word may have only one S.

Thus the pattern is **S M O _ _** with the remaining two letters not among the letters already ruled out (C,R,A,N,E,L,U,P,I,T,H,G). Good candidates are common letters like K and Y.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **SMOKY** (S M O K Y). This uses only allowed letters and will let us confirm the final two positions.

So the next guess is “SMOKY”.
