### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters C,R,A,N,E,I,H,T are not in the word.
- G is correct at position 3 (✓ from “MIGHT”).
- M is in the word but not at position 1 (‑ from “MIGHT”).

Thus the secret word has pattern: _ _ G _ _. It must contain M somewhere in positions 2‑5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new letters to test is **DOGMA**:
- D and O are new letters we haven’t tried.
- G is already known to be correct at position 3.
- M appears in position 4, giving us information about the correct spot for M.
- A is already known to be absent, but including it will simply confirm that.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A word that satisfies the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **PUGMY** (P U G M Y). It keeps G third and M fourth, and introduces new letters P, U, Y to test the remaining unknown positions.

So we will guess “PUGMY”.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 1: P is correct (✓).
- Position 2: unknown (U was wrong, so any other non‑excluded letter).
- Position 3: G is correct (✓).
- Position 4: M is correct (✓).
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓).

Thus the word is **P ? G M Y**. The common English word that fits this pattern is **PYGMY** (P‑Y‑G‑M‑Y). It uses only letters not ruled out and satisfies all known positions.

Hence the next guess should be PYGMY.
