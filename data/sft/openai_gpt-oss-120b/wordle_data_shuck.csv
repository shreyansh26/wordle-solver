# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback: 
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain the letter C somewhere in positions 2‑5, and none of the letters R, A, N, E. I’ll choose a common word that fits: **MUSIC** (C is at position 5, and the other letters M, U, S, I are all allowed).

We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Secret word starts with **S** (S is correct in position 1).
- The letter **C** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 → C can be in position 3 or 4.
- The letter **U** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → U can be in position 3 or 5.
- Letters ruled out: R, A, N, E, M, I, O, T (and also any letters from previous guesses that were marked “x”).

We need a 5‑letter English word that:
1. Begins with S,
2. Contains C and U in the allowed positions,
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been excluded.

One word that satisfies all of these conditions is **SHUCK**:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- H is a new allowed letter.
- U is in position 3 (allowed, not position 2 or 4).
- C is in position 4 (allowed, not position 1, 2, 5).
- K is a new allowed letter.

Thus SHUCK fits every piece of feedback received so far.
