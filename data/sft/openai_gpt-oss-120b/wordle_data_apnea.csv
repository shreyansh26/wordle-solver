### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:

I need a new guess that includes A and N to test their positions, and introduces fresh letters (avoiding C, R, E). “ALONG” does this:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- A is correct in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 2 (from guesses). So N can be at position 3 or 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, E, L, O, G, T, S, Y, and also from earlier C,R,E etc.
Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word starting with A, containing N at position 3 or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Consider “AVIAN”: A V I A N – fits pattern A _ _ _ N, uses V and I which are not eliminated, and ends with N (position 5). All letters are allowed.

Thus the next guess is AVIAN.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1 is A (✓).
- Position 3 is N (the only remaining spot for N after eliminating positions 2, 4, 5).
- Letter E is in the word (from the first guess’s “-”) but cannot be in position 5.
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (both gave “-”).
- Several letters are ruled out (C,R,L,O,G,T,S,Y,V,I) as they received “x”.

We need a word of the form A _ N _ _. The remaining letters can include E (but not at position 5), P, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Z, B, etc.

The word **APNEA** fits:
- A at position 1 (✓).
- N at position 3 (correct).
- Contains E at position 4 (allowed; E is not at position 5).
- Uses new letters P and A (A is already known) that haven’t been excluded.

Thus “APNEA” is a valid next guess.
