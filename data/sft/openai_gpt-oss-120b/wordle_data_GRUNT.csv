### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that:
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 4.
- C, A, and E are not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ R _ N _. It must avoid C, A, and E. A good candidate that satisfies the pattern and uses common letters is **TRUNK** (T R U N K). It respects all constraints, so I’ll guess that.

Letters eliminated so far (based on “x” feedback) are: **C, A, E, K, B**.  
Letter **T** is already placed at the end, and **R, U, N** are fixed in the middle. The only remaining unknown slot is the first letter.

A common English word fitting **_RUNT** and not using any eliminated letters is **GRUNT** (first letter G, which has not been ruled out).
