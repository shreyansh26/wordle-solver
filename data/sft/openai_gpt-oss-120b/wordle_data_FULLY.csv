### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = U (exact)
- Position 3 = L (exact)
- Position 5 = Y (exact)
- Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown.

Letters eliminated so far: A, B, C, E, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, R, S, T, and also the previously guessed letters that were marked absent. Remaining possible letters for the unknown spots are D, F, J, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly repeats of U, L, Y).

A common English word that fits the pattern ? U L ? Y, uses only allowed letters, and includes a repeat of L (which is allowed) is **FULLY** (F U L L Y). This respects all constraints:
- F is not eliminated.
- U is in the correct spot (2).
- L is in the correct spot (3) and can also appear at position 4.
- Y is correct at position 5.

Thus the next logical guess is “FULLY”.
