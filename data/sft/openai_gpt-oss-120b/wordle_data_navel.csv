### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new guess that:
1. Includes A and N in different positions from the ones ruled out.
2. Introduces new letters to test additional possibilities.
3. Avoids the excluded letters C, R, and E.

A good candidate is **ANVIL**:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- N is at position 2 (allowed).
- V, I, L are new letters to probe.
- No forbidden letters are present.

This guess will confirm the exact spots for A and N and test three new letters.

We have the pattern from previous feedback:
- V is correct at position 3.
- L is correct at position 5.
- A is in the word but not at position 1.
- N is in the word but not at position 2.
Thus the secret word looks like: _ _ V _ L, with A and N occupying the remaining slots without breaking the position rules.
Possible placements:
- A could be at position 2 or 4.
- N could be at position 1 or 4 (but not both in the same slot).
Choosing a word that respects these constraints and tests a new letter, “NOVAL” fits:
N (position 1) – allowed (N isn’t in position 2)
O (position 2) – new letter to test
V (position 3) – confirmed
A (position 4) – allowed (A isn’t in position 1)
L (position 5) – confirmed
This guess will confirm the exact spots for N and A and also tell us whether O is in the secret word.
