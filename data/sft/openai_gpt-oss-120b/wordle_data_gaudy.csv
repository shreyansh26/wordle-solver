### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess ARISE gave:
- A was marked “-”, meaning A is in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, and E were marked “x”, so none of those letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

Therefore the secret word must contain the letter A somewhere in positions 2‑5, and must avoid the letters R, I, S, and E entirely.

To get new information while respecting these constraints, I choose a word that:
1. Includes A (but not at the first position).
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
3. Introduces several new letters to test.

“CANON” fits these criteria:
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- The other letters C, N, O have not been tested yet.
- No prohibited letters (R, I, S, E) appear.

This guess will tell us whether A is correctly placed at position 2 and which of C, N, O are in the word (and if any are in the wrong position).

“CANON” fits these criteria:
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- The other letters C, N, O have not been tested yet.
- No prohibited letters (R, I, S, E) appear.

This guess will tell us whether A is correctly placed at position 2 and which of C, N, O are in the word (and if any are in the wrong position).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The first guess ARISE gave:
- A was marked “-”, meaning A is in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, and E were marked “x”, so none of those letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

Therefore the secret word must contain the letter A somewhere in positions 2‑5, and must avoid the letters R, I, S, and E entirely.

To get new information while respecting these constraints, I choose a word that:
1. Includes A (but not at the first position).
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
3. Introduces several new letters to test.

“CANON” fits these criteria:
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- The other letters C, N, O have not been tested yet.
- No prohibited letters (R, I, S, E) appear.

This guess will tell us whether A is correctly placed at position 2 and which of C, N, O are in the word (and if any are in the wrong position).
