### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that letters C, R, A, E are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"". Position constraints:
- C cannot be position 1
- R cannot be position 2
- A cannot be position 3
- E cannot be position 5
N is not in the word.

We need a five‑letter word containing C, R, A, E plus one other letter (not N) that respects those position restrictions. “RACED” fits:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- C in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- D in position 5 (new letter, not N)

Thus “RACED” is a valid next guess.

We have determined that the first four letters of the secret word are R A C E in that exact order, based on the feedback from guesses 2 and 3. The fifth letter is still unknown; it is not S, D, or N. A common English word that fits the pattern RACE_ is **RACER**. This will test whether the final letter is R (allowing a repeated R) or something else.
