### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Possible candidates are SCALE (E), SCALP (P), SCALY (Y). However, E was already marked as not in the word (from the first guess CRANE), so SCALE is impossible. That leaves SCALP and SCALY. Both are valid, but SCALP is the more common word. We'll guess SCALP.

We have confirmed the first four letters: S (position 1), C (2), A (3), L (4). The fifth letter is still unknown. Excluded letters from prior feedback: R, N, E, B, K, D, P (all marked x). Also letters C, L, A, S are already placed. The only common English word fitting the pattern S C A L _ with a new letter not excluded is ""SCALY"" (ending with Y). Y hasn't been tried and is not among the excluded letters, making it a valid next guess.
