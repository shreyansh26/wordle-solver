### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters that cannot appear anywhere: C, R, A, N, E, P, O, I, U, K, plus any letters already proven absent.
- Remaining possible letters for the unknown spots are among {B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} (excluding those already ruled out).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form **S _ _ _ Y** with an **L** at position 2 or 4, using only allowed letters.  
A common word that satisfies all constraints is **SHYLY**:
- Position 1: S (already confirmed)

- Position 4: L (L is present and not in position 3 or 5)
