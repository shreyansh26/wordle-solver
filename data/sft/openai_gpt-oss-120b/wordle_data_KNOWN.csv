### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I'll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes the vowel A and common letters C, R, N, and E.

We know from feedback:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in CRANE).

We need a new guess that includes N in a different position and avoids the excluded letters. A good candidate is **BUNTS**: it contains N at position 3 and uses only letters B, U, N, T, S, none of which have been ruled out.

We have the following information:
- Letters C, R, A, E, B, U, T, S are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BUNTS). Therefore N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
We need a word that:
1. Contains N in position 1, 2, or 5.
2. Does not contain any of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, E, B, U, T, S).
Looking at common words that meet these criteria, “KNOWN” fits:
- N is in position 2 (allowed) and also position 5 (allowed).
- The other letters K, O, W are not among the eliminated letters.
Thus “KNOWN” is a suitable next guess.
