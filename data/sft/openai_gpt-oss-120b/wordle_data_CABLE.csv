We know the secret word starts with C and ends with E. The letter A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3, so it can be in position 2 or 4. Letters R and N are not in the word at all.

A suitable word that fits these constraints is **CABLE**: 
- C is in position 1 (✓),
- A is in position 2 (allowed),
- B and L are filler letters,
- E is in position 5 (✓),
- No R or N present.

Thus I will guess ""CABLE"".
