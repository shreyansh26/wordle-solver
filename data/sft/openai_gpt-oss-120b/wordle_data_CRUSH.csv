### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to gather useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know the secret word starts with C R (positions 1 and 2). Letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all. I need a word that fits the pattern C R _ _ _. Choose a common word without A, N, E. “CROWD” (C R O W D) satisfies these constraints and will test three new letters O, W, D.

We have confirmed that the first two letters are C and R in the correct positions. The letters A, N, E, O, W, and D are not in the word at all. Therefore the secret word matches the pattern C R _ _ _. 

We need a five‑letter word starting with “CR” that does not contain any of the eliminated letters (A, N, E, O, W, D). Candidates include:
- CRUSH (adds U, S, H)
- CRISP (adds I, S, P)
- CRUMB (adds U, M, B)
- CROSS (adds O, S, S) – O is eliminated, so not usable.
- CRATE – contains A, eliminated.

Choosing “CRUSH” introduces three new letters (U, S, H) while respecting the constraints.

Thus the next guess is:
