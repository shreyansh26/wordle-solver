### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain C, A, N (each placed elsewhere), and cannot contain R or E. We need two additional letters. A good candidate that satisfies the positional constraints is **MANIC**:
- C is at position 5 (not position 1).
- A is at position 2 (not position 3).
- N is at position 3 (not position 4).
- It introduces new letters M and I, which have not been ruled out.
Therefore, we guess ""MANIC"".

From the second guess (MANIC), we have:
- A is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- I is correct at position 4.
- C is correct at position 5.
- M is not in the word.

From the first guess, we already knew C is in the word but not at position 1, A is in the word but not at position 3, N is in the word but not at position 4, and R, E are absent. All these constraints line up with the pattern **_ A N I C**.

The only common English word fitting that pattern and using only letters not ruled out is **PANIC** (P A N I C). No previous feedback contradicts this choice.

Thus the next guess should be PANIC.
