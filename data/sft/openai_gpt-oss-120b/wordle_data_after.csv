### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback that S and L are not in the secret word. The letters A, T, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively). Therefore:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- T cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We should choose a new word that:
1. Excludes S and L.
2. Places A, T, and E in different positions that satisfy the above constraints.
3. Introduces some new letters to gather more information.

The word **TREAD** fits these criteria:
- T is placed in position 1 (allowed).
- R is a new letter to test.
- E is placed in position 3 (allowed, since E cannot be 5).
- A is placed in position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be 3).
- D is another new letter to test.

Thus, the next logical guess is TREAD.
