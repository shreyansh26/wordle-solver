### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (the position it occupied in CRANE).

Therefore, the next guess must exclude C, R, N, E and must include A in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th). I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints: **ADULT** (A in position 1, and other letters D, U, L, T are not ruled out yet).

From feedback:
- Letters not in word: C, R, N, E, D, U, L.
- Present letters: A (not in positions 1 or 3), T (not in position 5).

We need a 5‑letter word containing A and T, avoiding the excluded letters, and respecting position constraints.

""PASTA"" fits:
- Contains A (positions 2 and 5) – both allowed (A not in 1 or 3).
- Contains T (position 4) – not position 5.
- Other letters P and S are not excluded.

Thus ""PASTA"" is a valid next guess.
