### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a valid five‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters in varied positions, such as “CRANE”. This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and where they might belong.

We know:
- Letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was the fourth letter in “CRANE”).

We need a 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.

Choosing common letters for the remaining spots, “DONUT” fits:
- Contains N in the 3rd position (different from position 4).
- Uses D, O, U, T, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it’s a valid second guess.

We have eliminated letters C, R, A, E, D, O, U, T (all marked x). The letter N is present but not in positions 3 or 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""CRANE"" and position 3 in ""DONUT""). Therefore N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

The word **NYMPH** meets all constraints:
- N is in position 1 (allowed).
- All other letters (Y, M, P, H) are from the allowed set.
- No eliminated letters appear.
Thus it is a valid next guess.
