### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

We have determined that only the letters R and E are confirmed to be in the secret word. From the feedback:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
All other letters from previous guesses (C, A, N, M, I, T) are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes R and E, respects those position restrictions, and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out. “ROBED” fits:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- The other letters O, B, D have not been eliminated.
Thus “ROBED” is a valid next guess.

- E is confirmed at position 4 (✓ from ROBED).
- Letters C, A, N, M, I, T, O, B, D are not in the word.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (already satisfied), and E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (already satisfied).

Thus the word looks like: R _ _ E _. We need a common English word that fits this pattern using only letters not yet ruled out. “RULER” (R‑U‑L‑E‑R) satisfies all constraints:
- Starts with R and has E in the fourth spot.
- Uses U, L, and a second R, none of which have been eliminated.
- No prohibited letters appear.
