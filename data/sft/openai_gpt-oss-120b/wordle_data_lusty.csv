### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I. We know S and T are present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (from MOIST). So we need a word that includes S and T, with S not in position 4, T not in position 5. Choose a common word fitting these constraints and using only allowed letters. ""STUDY"" places S at position 1 and T at position 2, satisfying the position constraints, and uses letters U, D, Y which haven't been ruled out. This is a good next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:

- Position 2 is U (confirmed from TUSKY).
- Position 3 is S (confirmed from TUSKY).
- Position 5 is Y (confirmed from STUDY and TUSKY).
- Letter T is present but not in positions 1,2,5; the only remaining spot is position 4, so T goes to position 4.
- Position 1 must be a letter not yet eliminated (eliminated letters: A, C, D, E, I, K, M, N, O, R) and cannot be T, U, S, or Y.

Thus the word fits the pattern _ U S T Y. Viable English words: BUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY, FUSTY. Choose a common one: **BUSTY**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the pattern _ U S T Y from previous feedback.

- Position 1 cannot be B (eliminated), C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D, K, or T (from earlier clues).
- Viable letters for position 1 that haven’t been eliminated are F, G, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, etc.
- Common English words that fit the pattern are **GUSTY**, **LUSTY**, and **FUSTY**.
- “GUSTY” is a frequent word and fits all constraints.

Thus the next guess should be “GUSTY”.
