### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- E is placed at position 4 (different from position 5).
- The word uses common letters O, L, S and contains no C, A, N.

Thus this guess satisfies all constraints and should give new information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROLES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → R can be in 3 or 5.
- E is confirmed at position 4.
- S is in the word but not at position 5 → S can be in positions 1‑3 (not 4 because E is there).
- Letters C, A, N, O, L are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with E at the fourth slot, containing R and S in allowable positions, and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. The word **SHRED** fits:
- S at position 1 (allowed)
- H at position 2 (new letter to test)
- R at position 3 (allowed)
- E at position 4 (confirmed)
- D at position 5 (new letter to test)

All constraints are satisfied.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)

R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1‑3 (all gave “-”), so R must be at position 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S _ _ E R**.

Letters ruled out so far: C, A, N, O, L, H, D, plus the positions for R we know.

We need to choose letters for positions 2 and 3 from the remaining alphabet. Good candidate words fitting S_ _ER are:
- **SKIER** (tests K and I)
- **STIER** (tests T and I)
- **SUPER** (tests U and P)

Choosing a word that introduces new letters will give the most information. “SKIER” provides two new letters (K, I) while keeping the known correct letters in place.

So the next guess will be:
