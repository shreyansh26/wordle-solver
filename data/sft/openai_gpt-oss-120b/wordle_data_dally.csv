### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The feedback from the first guess “CRANE” tells me:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

So I need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Does **not** use C, R, N, or E anywhere.

A good candidate is “ADULT”:
- It contains A (in the 1st position, which satisfies the “not in 3rd” rule).
- The other letters D, U, L, T are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “ADULT” is a valid next guess.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, T.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1 (from guess ADULT) nor 3 (from guess CRANE). So A can be in positions 2 or 5.
- Letter D is in the word but not in position 2. So D can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Letter L is correct in position 4.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ L _.  
A must be at position 2 or 5, D must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
A word that fits all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **DAILY** (D‑A‑I‑L‑Y):
- D is at position 1 (allowed, not position 2).
- A is at position 2 (allowed, not positions 1 or 3).
- L is at position 4 (fixed correct).
- I and Y are new letters not yet ruled out.

Therefore DAILY satisfies all known information.

So I need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Does **not** use C, R, N, or E anywhere.

A good candidate is “ADULT”:
- It contains A (in the 1st position, which satisfies the “not in 3rd” rule).
- The other letters D, U, L, T are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “ADULT” is a valid next guess.

<guess>ADULT</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADULT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, T.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1 (from guess ADULT) nor 3 (from guess CRANE). So A can be in positions 2 or 5.
- Letter D is in the word but not in position 2. So D can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Letter L is correct in position 4.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ L _.  
A must be at position 2 or 5, D must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
A word that fits all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **DAILY** (D‑A‑I‑L‑Y):
- D is at position 1 (allowed, not position 2).
- A is at position 2 (allowed, not positions 1 or 3).
- L is at position 4 (fixed correct).
- I and Y are new letters not yet ruled out.

Therefore DAILY satisfies all known information.

- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Thus the word must be D A _ L Y. Viable English words fitting this pattern include **DABLY** (where the third letter B is permissible) and **DALLY** (third letter L, also allowed). Both satisfy all constraints. I will choose **DABLY** as the next guess.

We have these constraints:
- Confirmed letters: D (position 1), A (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5).
- Position 3 is still unknown.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, U, T, I, B.
- The third letter cannot be any of the excluded letters and may be a duplicate of an already‑known letter.
A common English word fitting the pattern D A _ L Y is **DALLY** (with L also at position 3). This uses only allowed letters and satisfies all feedback so far.

Thus the next guess should be DALLY.
