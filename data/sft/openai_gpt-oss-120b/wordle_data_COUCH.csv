I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which will give informative feedback.

Given feedback, the secret word starts with C and does NOT contain R, A, N, or E in any position. I need a new 5‑letter word beginning with C and using only other letters. ""CLOUD"" fits: C is first, and L, O, U, D are not among the excluded letters. It’s a common English word, so it’s a good next guess.

We know:
- Position 1 is C.
- Letters not in the word: R, A, N, E, L, D.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: O (not position 3), U (not position 4).

We need a 5‑letter word starting with C, containing O and U, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
“COUCH” fits:
- C is first (✓).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, not position 3).
- U is in position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- Remaining letters H are not excluded.
Thus “COUCH” is a valid next guess.
