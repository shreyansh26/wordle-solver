### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes frequent consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) which will give useful information about the secret word.

We need a new guess that includes R and N in different positions, avoids C, A, E, and tests new letters. The word “NORTH” places N in position 1 and R in position 3, satisfying the position constraints, and introduces O, T, H for further clues.

We have two letters known to be in the secret word: R and N.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and NORTH).  
- N cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from CRANE and NORTH).  

All other letters tried (C, A, E, O, T, H) are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains both R and N.
2. Places R in a permissible position (1, 4, or 5) and N in a permissible position (2, 3, or 5).
3. Introduces new letters while avoiding the known‑absent ones.

The word **SPURN** satisfies these conditions:
- S P U R N → R is in position 4 (allowed) and N is in position 5 (allowed).
- It adds the fresh letters S, P, and U for further clues.
- None of its letters are among the excluded set {C, A, E, O, T, H}.

Thus SPURN is a logical next guess.

We have determined:
- N is correct in position 5.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, so it must be position 1.
- P is in the word but cannot be in position 2, so it must be position 3 or 4.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **R _ _ _ N**, with P at position 3 or 4.  
We need a word that respects these constraints while introducing new letters to test. “RIPEN” matches the pattern (R I P E N) and places P at position 3. It also tests the letters I and E (E was previously marked absent, giving us a chance to confirm that), while respecting all known exclusions.
