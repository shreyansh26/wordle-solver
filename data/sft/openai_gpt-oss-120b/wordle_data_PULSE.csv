### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a frequent starter in these games because it covers a consonant cluster (C,R,N) and two vowels (A,E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

The feedback tells us that only the last letter 'E' is correct and in the correct position. All other letters (C, R, A, N) are not present anywhere in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must end with 'E' and must avoid using C, R, A, N in any position. I’ll pick a common word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters for testing. “MOUSE” meets the criteria (M, O, U, S, E) and uses none of the excluded letters.

We know from feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- The fourth letter is **S** (position 4) because S was marked ✓ in MOUSE.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, M, O** are not in the word.
- Letter **U** is in the word but not in position 3 (it got a “-” in MOUSE). So U must be in position 1 or 2.

Thus the pattern is:
_ _ _ S E, with U in either the first or second slot, and no forbidden letters.

A common word fitting these constraints is **PULSE** (P U L S E):
- Ends with SE, fourth letter S, fifth E.
- Contains U in the second position (allowed).
- Uses none of the excluded letters.

So “PULSE” is a valid next guess.
