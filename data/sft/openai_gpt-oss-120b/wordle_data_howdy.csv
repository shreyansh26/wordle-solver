# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From SLOTH: S,L,T are also not present; O and H are present but in wrong positions (O not position 3, H not position 5).

So the secret word must contain the letters O and H, and cannot contain any of {C,R,A,N,E,S,L,T}. The remaining allowed letters are {B,D,F,G,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} plus O and H.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes O and H, with O not in the 3rd slot and H not in the 5th slot. A valid English word meeting these constraints is **HOPPY** (H at 1, O at 2, P,P,Y are allowed letters). It satisfies all conditions, so we will guess it.
