### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → all letters wrong → C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
2. PLUMB → P and L are wrong; U, M, B are present but in wrong spots.
   - So U, M, B must be in the word, but not in positions 3 (U), 4 (M), 5 (B) respectively.
3. JUMBO → J is wrong; U is correct in position 2; M, B, O are present but in wrong spots.
   - Confirms U is at position 2.
   - M cannot be in position 3 (from JUMBO) and not in 4 (from PLUMB) → M can be 1 or 5.
   - B cannot be in position 4 (JUMBO) nor 5 (PLUMB) → B can be 1 or 3.
   - O cannot be in position 5 (JUMBO) → O can be 1,3,4.

Thus the word must be of the form:
_ U _ _ _
containing the letters M, B, O (each placed respecting the above limits) and one additional letter not yet excluded.

A word that satisfies all constraints is **BUXOM**:
- B at position 1 (allowed)
