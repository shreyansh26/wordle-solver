### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information. “CRANE” is a frequent starter in word-guessing games because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three commonly used consonants (C, R, N). This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We have the pattern based on feedback:
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 4 is R (✓ from second guess).
- Position 2 is H (✓ from second guess).
- Letters C, A, N, S, O are not in the word (all marked x).
Thus the word must be of the form _ H _ R E, using only letters not excluded.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **THERE** (T‑H‑E‑R‑E). It respects all known constraints and introduces new letters (T and another E) for further testing.
