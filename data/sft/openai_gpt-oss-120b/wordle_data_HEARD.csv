2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word has pattern __A__ with A fixed at position 3. It must contain R (not at position 2) and E (not at position 5). It must not contain C or N. Choosing a word that satisfies these constraints, ""HEARD"" fits:
- H E A R D
- A is at position 3 (✓).
- R is at position 4 (not position 2) (‑).
- E is at position 2 (not position 5) (‑).
- No C or N present.

Therefore the next guess is ""HEARD"".
