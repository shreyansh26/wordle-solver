### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position (A✓, E✓). The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all. So the pattern is _ _ A _ E, with no C, R, N anywhere.

We need a new guess that respects this pattern and introduces new letters to narrow down the possibilities. Good candidates include words like SLATE, GLADE, BLAME, SHAPE, etc. I’ll choose **SLATE** because it adds the new letters S, L, and T, which are common and will give useful information.
