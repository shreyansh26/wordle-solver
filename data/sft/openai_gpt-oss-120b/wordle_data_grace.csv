### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: G (✓) → G is correct.
- Position 2: R (✓) → R is correct.
- Position 3: A (✓) → A is correct.
- Position 4: T was marked x → T is not in the word.
- Position 5: E (✓) → E is correct.

Thus the hidden word is **G R A _ E**, with the fourth letter unknown (and it cannot be T). Candidate words fitting this pattern include **GRAPE** and **GRAVE** (C is excluded, so GRACE is impossible). To determine which letter belongs in the fourth slot, we need a guess that tests a new letter. Choosing **GRAPE** will test the letter P; if the feedback shows P as correct, the word is GRAPE, otherwise it must be GRAVE.

Therefore, the next guess is GRAPE.

We have the confirmed pattern G R A _ E. Letters excluded from the fourth position (and overall) are T, P, V, C, N. The fourth letter must be a different consonant. Common English words fitting this pattern are GRADE (with D) and GRAZE (with Z). Both D and Z have not been tested yet. To narrow it down, I’ll guess GRADE, introducing D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
