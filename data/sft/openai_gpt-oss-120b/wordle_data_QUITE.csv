### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word ends with E (position 5 is correct). The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

We have determined the secret word pattern is __ITE with positions 3 I, 4 T, 5 E confirmed. Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, G, L, O, B, S, M, W, H. Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2 include Q and U, among others. A common English word fitting __ITE and using only unused letters is ""QUITE"". This will test Q and U while keeping the known correct suffix.
