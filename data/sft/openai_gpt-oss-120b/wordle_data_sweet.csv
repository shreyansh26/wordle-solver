### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Secret word starts with S (position 1).
- Position 3 is E, correctly placed.
- Letters C, R, A, N, H, L, F are not in the word.
- E cannot be in position 5 (from first guess), but we have it at position 3 already.

We need a word of form S _ E _ _. Choose letters not ruled out, and avoid placing another E at position 5. A good candidate that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **SPEWS** (S P E W S). It uses only allowed letters, puts E correctly at position 3, and adds P and W for new information.

We have the following information from the feedback:

- Position 1 is **S** (correct).
- Position 3 is **E** (correct).
- Letter **P** is not in the word.
- Letter **W** is in the word but not in position 4.
- The extra **S** at position 5 is not correct; the only S is at position 1.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, H, L, F** are not in the word.
- From the first guess we also know **E** cannot be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is **S _ E _ _**, with W somewhere other than position 4 (so W can be at position 2 or 5) and the remaining letters must be new, not among the excluded set.

A good candidate that respects all constraints is **SWEET**:
- S at position 1 (✓)
- W at position 2 (tests the possible location of W)
- E at position 3 (✓)
- E at position 4 (still allowed)
- T at position 5 (a new letter, not excluded, and not E)

This guess introduces a new letter **T** and places **W** in position 2, giving us clear information for the next step.
