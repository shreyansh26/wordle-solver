### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common, well‑balanced five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good chance of hitting some correct letters or positions.

We know:
- E is correct at position 5.
- U is in the word but not at position 3.
- Letters C, R, A, N, H, O, S are not in the word at all.

We need a new five‑letter word ending in E, containing U in a position other than 3, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
A suitable candidate is **BUDGE** (B U D G E):  
- Ends with E, satisfying the known correct final letter.  
- Places U at position 2, which is allowed (U is not at position 3).  
- Uses letters B, D, G that have not been ruled out.

Thus “BUDGE” is a valid next guess.
