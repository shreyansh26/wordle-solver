### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, N, or E. The letter A is present but cannot be in the third position (its position in CRANE). Therefore, our next guess must include A in a different slot and avoid the excluded letters. A good candidate is ""ADULT"": it includes A in the first position and uses only letters (D, U, L, T) that have not been ruled out.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is correct at position 1 (A✓).
- T is correct at position 5 (T✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (L‑). So L can be in position 2 or 3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, D, U.

We need a word of form A _ _ _ T, containing L (not at position 4), and using only letters not excluded. Possible candidates include **ALOFT** (A L O F T) and **ALLOT** (A L L O T). Both fit the pattern and constraints. I’ll guess “ALOFT” to test new letters O and F.
