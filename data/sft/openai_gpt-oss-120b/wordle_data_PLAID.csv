### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback: C is not in the word, L is correct in position 2, O is not in the word, U is not in the word, D is correct in position 5.  
So the secret word pattern is: _ L _ _ D, with the letters C, O, U ruled out entirely.  
I need a valid 5‑letter word that has L as the second letter and D as the fifth letter, and does not contain C, O, or U.  
""BLAND"" fits this pattern (B L A N D) and introduces three new letters (B, A, N) to test.

We know the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 2 is L (✓)
- Position 3 is A (✓)
- Position 5 is D (✓)
- Letters C, O, U, B, N are not in the word (x).

So the word looks like: _ L A _ D.

We need a valid English word fitting that pattern that does not use the excluded letters. “PLAID” (P L A I D) satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (P and I) to test.
