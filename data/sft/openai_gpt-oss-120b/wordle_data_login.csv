### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have two pieces of feedback:

1. From CRANE: C,R,A,E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
2. From BINGO: B,G,O are not in the word. I and N are in the word but each is in the wrong position. So:
   - I cannot be at position 2 (it was at position 2 in BINGO).
   - N cannot be at positions 3 (it was at position 3 in BINGO) nor 4 (from CRANE).

Thus N can be at positions 1, 2, or 5. I can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a common 5‑letter word containing both N and I, respecting those position restrictions, and avoiding the forbidden letters C,R,A,E,B,G,O.

The word **UNTIL** fits:
- Contains N (position 2) – allowed.
- Contains I (position 4) – allowed (not position 2).
- Uses only letters U, N, T, I, L, none of which are excluded.

Therefore the next guess is UNTIL.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, B, G, O, U, T.
- Must contain I at position 4 (I(✓) in UNTIL).
- Must contain N, but N is not at positions 2,3,4; it can be at position 1 or 5.
- Must contain L, but L is not at position 5 (L(-) in UNTIL), so L can be at positions 1‑3.
- Remaining letters must be from the allowed set {D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

A word that fits all these constraints is **LYSIN**:
- L in position 1 (allowed), Y in position 2, S in position 3, I in position 4 (required), N in position 5 (allowed for N).
- No excluded letters are used.

Thus the next guess should be “LYSIN”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first feedback:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (where it appeared in “CRANE”).

So I need a new 5‑letter word that contains N (but not at position 4) and avoids the letters C, R, A, and E. “BINGO” fits: it has N in the third spot, and none of the forbidden letters appear.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: BINGO -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) N(-) G(-) O(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two pieces of feedback:

1. From CRANE: C,R,A,E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
2. From BINGO: B,G,O are not in the word. I and N are in the word but each is in the wrong position. So:
   - I cannot be at position 2 (it was at position 2 in BINGO).
   - N cannot be at positions 3 (it was at position 3 in BINGO) nor 4 (from CRANE).

Thus N can be at positions 1, 2, or 5. I can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a common 5‑letter word containing both N and I, respecting those position restrictions, and avoiding the forbidden letters C,R,A,E,B,G,O.

The word **UNTIL** fits:
- Contains N (position 2) – allowed.
- Contains I (position 4) – allowed (not position 2).
- Uses only letters U, N, T, I, L, none of which are excluded.

Therefore the next guess is UNTIL.
