### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that:
- S and T are not in the secret word.
- L, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “SLATE”. That means:
  - L cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new word that includes L, A, and E in different positions, avoids S and T, and introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

“EARLY” satisfies all constraints:
- Contains E (position 1, not 5), A (position 2, not 3), L (position 4, not 2).
- Adds R and Y as new letters.
- No S or T.

Thus “EARLY” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback so far:

- From SLATE: S(x) → S not in the word.  
  L(-) → L is in the word, but not in position 2.  
  A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.  
  T(x) → T not in the word.  
  E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

- From EARLY: E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 1.  
  A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 2.  
  R(-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.  
  L(-) → L is in the word, but not in position 4.  
  Y(✓) → Y is correct at position 5.

So the secret word must contain the letters **L, E, A, R, Y** with Y fixed at the 5th spot.  
Constraints on the remaining positions:

- Position 1: cannot be E (from EARLY), but can be L, A, or R.  
- Position 2: cannot be L (from SLATE) and cannot be A (from EARLY); possible letters are E or R.  
- Position 3: cannot be A (from SLATE) and cannot be R (from EARLY); possible letters are L or E.  
- Position 4: cannot be L (from EARLY); possible letters are A, E, or R.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **RELAY**:
- R 1 (allowed)
- E 2 (allowed)
- L 3 (allowed)
- A 4 (allowed)
- Y 5 (fixed)

Thus “RELAY” is a valid next guess.
