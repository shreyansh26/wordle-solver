### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5).

So the next guess should:
1. Exclude C, A, N.
2. Include R and E, placing them in different positions (R not 2nd, E not 5th).
3. Introduce three new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **MOVER**:
- Contains R (position 5, which is allowed) and E (position 4, also allowed).
- Adds new letters M, O, V to test.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, N.

Thus I will submit ""MOVER"".
