### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- From METAL: M is not in the word, E is correct at position 2, T is correct at position 3, A is correct at position 4, L is correct at position 5.
Thus the secret word pattern is _ E T A L.

All letters that have been ruled out: C, R, N, P, D, Q, U, M (and also the earlier X's for those letters). The only remaining plausible English word fitting ""?ETAL"" is **FETAL** (F‑E‑T‑A‑L). The letter F has not been tried and is not among the excluded letters.

So the next guess should be FETAL.
