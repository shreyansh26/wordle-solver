### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have letters known to be in the word: R, A, O. Their positions are constrained:
- R is not in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3,4,5.
- A is not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1,4,5.
- O is not in position 5 → possible positions 1‑4.

The letters C, N, E, D, I are ruled out.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing R, A, O and two other letters not among the excluded set, while satisfying the position constraints.

Testing “MORAL” (M O R A L):
- Position 1 = M (allowed)
- Position 2 = O (O allowed in position 2)
- Position 3 = R (R allowed in position 3)
- Position 4 = A (A allowed in position 4)
- Position 5 = L (O is not in position 5, fine)

All constraints are met, and none of the forbidden letters appear. Thus “MORAL” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the confirmed letters and their positions:

- R is confirmed at position 3 (feedback ✓ from MORAL).

Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in MORAL at position 4), so A can be at position 1 or 5.

All excluded letters so far are: C, N, E, D, I, M, L (and also any repeats of these).  
We need a 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern:

1️⃣ A or other letter (but must contain A somewhere)  
2️⃣ O (fixed)  
3️⃣ R (fixed)  
4️⃣ any allowed letter (not excluded, not A)  
5️⃣ A or other allowed letter (if A not used at position 1).

- Position 3 R (✓),
- Position 4 T (T is not excluded),
