### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R and A are in the word but are in the wrong positions (R isn’t position 2, A isn’t position 3).

So the next word must contain R and A, avoid C, N, E, and place R somewhere other than the 2nd slot and A somewhere other than the 3rd slot.

A good candidate is **RAILS**:
- Contains R (position 1, not 2) and A (position 2, not 3).
- Uses only new letters G, I, L, S which haven’t been ruled out.
- No prohibited letters C, N, or E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RAILS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- A is correct at position 2 (from RAILS).
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (both guesses) and not in position 2 (occupied by A). So R can be in positions 3‑5.
- Eliminated letters: C, N, E, I, L, S.

We need a common 5‑letter word with pattern _ A _ _ _, containing R in one of the last three spots, and using none of the eliminated letters. “MAJOR” fits perfectly:
- A is at position 2.
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- Letters M, J, O are not eliminated and are common enough.

Thus “MAJOR” is a strong next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **A** (confirmed twice).
- Letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5. Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, N, E, I, L, S, M, J, O.
- Remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course A and R).

We need a 5‑letter word that fits the pattern:
_ A _ _ _
with R in position 3 or 4, using only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **T A R R Y**:
- A is correctly placed at position 2.
- R appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying the requirement that R is in one of those spots.
- The new letters T and Y have not been tested yet, giving us fresh information.

Thus the next guess will be “TARRY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- C, N, E are not in the word.

So the next word must contain R and A, avoid C, N, E, and place R somewhere other than the 2nd slot and A somewhere other than the 3rd slot.

A good candidate is **RAILS**:
