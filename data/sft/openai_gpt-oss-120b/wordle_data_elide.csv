- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have accumulated feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): only E is correct in position 5.
- Guess 2 (SHOVE): only E is correct in position 5.
- Guess 3 (PLUME): L is correct in position 2, E still correct in position 5.
- Guess 4 (GLIDE): L (pos2), I (pos3), D (pos4), E (pos5) are all correct; G (pos1) is not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ L I D E, with the first letter not G and must be a letter not eliminated earlier (C,R,A,N,S,H,O,V,P,U,M,G). The common English word that fits is **ELIDE** (E L I D E). The letter E is already confirmed at the end, but it can also appear elsewhere; no feedback contradicts that. Therefore the next guess should be ELIDE.
