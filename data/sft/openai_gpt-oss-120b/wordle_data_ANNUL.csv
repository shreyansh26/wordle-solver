### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a common, well‑balanced five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the vowel “A” and the frequently used letters C, R, N, and E, which will give me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

We know from feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or E. It DOES contain A and N, but they are NOT in the positions they appeared in the first guess (position 3 for A, position 4 for N). So we need a new guess that includes A and N in different spots, and avoids C, R, and E entirely. A good candidate is “ALIGN”: A is now at position 1, N at position 5, and the other letters (L, I, G) are new and allowed.

We have the following information:

- Position 1 is definitely **A** (A ✓ in ALIGN).
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (L - in ALIGN).
- Letter **N** is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (N - in ALIGN and also N - in CRANE where it was position 4). Therefore **N** can only be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters **C, R, E, I, G** are not in the word (all marked x).
- We need a real 5‑letter English word that respects these constraints and introduces at least one new letter to gather more information.

A suitable word is **ANNUL**:
- A is in position 1 (matches the known correct spot).
- N appears in positions 2 and 3 (both allowed for N).
- L is in position 5 (L is present and not in position 2, satisfying the L‑constraint).
- The new letter **U** gives us fresh information, and no prohibited letters are used.

Thus, “ANNUL” is a valid next guess.
