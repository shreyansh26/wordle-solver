### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Thus the next guess must contain R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.  
A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **RULER** (R at positions 1 and 5, E at position 4). It also introduces new letters U and L to gather more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RULER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- Position 2 is U (✓).
- Position 4 is E (✓).
- Position 5 is R (✓).
- The first R got a “-”, meaning there is another R elsewhere (not at position 1). Since we already have an R at position 5, the other R must be at position 3.
Thus the pattern is: _ U R E R.

Letters eliminated so far: C, A, N, L (from ‘x’ feedback). The remaining unknown first letter can be any letter not yet ruled out. The word **SURER** fits the pattern (S U R E R) and uses only allowed letters.

So the next guess should be SURER.

Guess 2: RULER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: SURER -> FEEDBACK: S(x) U(✓) R(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

1. **CRANE** → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   - C, A, N are not in the word.  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. **RULER** → R(-) U(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   - Position 2 = **U** (correct).  
   - Position 4 = **E** (correct).  
   - Position 5 = **R** (correct).  
   - There is another **R** somewhere else (the first R got “-”).  

3. **SURER** → S(x) U(✓) R(-) E(✓) R(✓)  
   - Position 2 = **U**, Position 4 = **E**, Position 5 = **R** confirmed again.  
   - The R at position 3 is yellow, meaning the word contains an additional R that is **not** at position 3.  
   - Since we already have an R fixed at position 5, the extra R must be at position 1.  

Thus the secret word follows the pattern:

**R U _ E R**

The third letter cannot be R (already accounted for) and must not be any letters previously ruled out: C, A, N, L, S. Viable common letters include D, B, etc.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **RUDER** (the comparative form of “rude”). It uses only allowed letters and introduces a new letter D for more information.

Therefore the next guess should be:

We have confirmed positions:

- 4 = E (✓)
- 5 = R (✓)

R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (both gave “-”). So the only R is at position 5.

Excluded letters from “x” feedback: C, A, N, L, S, D.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ U _ E R, with letters at positions 1 and 3 not being R, C, A, N, L, S, D.

Common English words matching this pattern include **BUYER** (B U Y E R) and **TUBER** (T U B E R). Both use allowed letters and introduce new ones (B, Y, T). Either could be correct; we need another guess to differentiate. I’ll choose **TUBER** as the next guess.
