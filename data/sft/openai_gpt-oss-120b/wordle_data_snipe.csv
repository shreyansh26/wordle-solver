### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **N** somewhere in positions 1‑3, and must avoid the letters C, R, A.  
We need a valid 5‑letter word meeting these conditions.  
**LUNGE** fits:
- Ends with E (position 5 correct).

- The letter **N** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5. So **N** must be in position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, L, U, G (they are not in the word).

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing N at position 1 or 2, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
Possible candidates:
- **NOISE** (N O I S E) → N in position 1, uses new letters O, I, S.
- **KNIFE** (K N I F E) → N in position 2, uses new letters K, I, F.

- Contains N at position 3 (acceptable, not position 4).
- Uses letters L, U, G that are not ruled out.
So LUNGE is a good second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: LUNGE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 is correct).
- The letter **N** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5. So **N** must be in position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, L, U, G (they are not in the word).

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing N at position 1 or 2, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
Possible candidates:
- **NOISE** (N O I S E) → N in position 1, uses new letters O, I, S.
- **KNIFE** (K N I F E) → N in position 2, uses new letters K, I, F.

Both fit the constraints and introduce fresh letters to test. I’ll guess **KNIFE** to probe the second‑position possibility for N and to test K, I, and F.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:

- Position 2 = N (confirmed from KNIFE).
- Position 3 = I (confirmed from KNIFE).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, L, U, G, K, F, plus any from earlier guesses that were marked x.
Thus the word pattern is _ N I _ E, with unknown letters at positions 1 and 4 that must not be any excluded letters.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **SNIDE** (S N I D E). It introduces two new letters (S and D) while respecting all known constraints.

So the next guess will be SNIDE.

We have the following confirmed letters from feedback:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Position 4 is still unknown; D was guessed there and was marked x, so D is not in the word. All other letters marked x in previous guesses (C, R, A, L, U, G, K, F) are also not allowed.

The only remaining slot is the fourth letter, and it must be a letter not yet excluded. A common English word that fits the pattern S N I _ E is **SNIPE** (with P in the fourth position). This introduces a new, untested letter P and satisfies all known constraints.

Thus the next guess should be SNIPE.
