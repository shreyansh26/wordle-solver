### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that the secret word must contain the letters C and R, each in a different position from where they appeared in previous guesses. From the feedback:

- C is present but not in positions 1 or 3.
- R is present but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Letters A, N, E, O, K, Y are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C and R respecting those position constraints, and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out. The word **SCRUB** fits:
- C is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- Remaining letters S, U, B are not among the excluded letters.
Thus SCRUB is a valid next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- R is in the word, and we have a ✓ at position 3 → R is fixed at position 3.
- U is in the word, but not at position 4 → U can be at 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, N, E, O, K, Y, S, B.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes C, R, and U with those position constraints, and uses none of the excluded letters.

The word **PURCH** fits perfectly:
- P (allowed)
- U at position 2 (allowed, not position 4)
- R at position 3 (✓)
- C at position 4 (allowed, not positions 1‑3)
- H (allowed)

All constraints are satisfied, so we guess ""PURCH"".

From the feedback:
- Position 2: U is correct.
- Position 3: R is correct.
- Position 4: C is correct.
- Position 5: H is correct.
- Position 1 is unknown, but any previously ruled‑out letters (A, N, E, O, K, Y, S, B, P) cannot be used.

A common English word fitting the pattern _ U R C H is **LURCH** (L U R C H). The first letter L has not been excluded, making this a valid remaining guess.
