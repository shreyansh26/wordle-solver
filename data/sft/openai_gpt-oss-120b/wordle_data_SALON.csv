### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. 
A good opening guess is **CRANE** because it includes the frequent vowel ‘A’ and ‘E’, and the common consonants C, R, N. This should give a clear picture of which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but are in the wrong positions (A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Includes both A and N (to test their positions).
- Does not place A in position 3 or N in position 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, and E.

A good candidate is **ANVIL**:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- N is in position 2 (allowed).
- The other letters V, I, L have not been ruled out yet.

Thus ANVIL satisfies all constraints.
