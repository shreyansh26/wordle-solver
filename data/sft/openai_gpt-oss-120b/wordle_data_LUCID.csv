### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

So the next guess must contain L in a different slot (1,3,4, or 5) and avoid S, A, T, E. I’ll choose a common word that meets these criteria: “WORLD” (L is in position 4, and none of the eliminated letters appear).

We have determined the secret word pattern from the feedback:

- Position 1: L (✓ from LIVID and LIPID)
- Position 4: I (✓ from LIVID and LIPID)
- Position 5: D (✓ from WORLD, LIVID, LIPID)

Letters known not to be in the word: S, A, T, E, W, O, R, V, P (and also any others guessed with x).  
The remaining unknown positions are 2 and 3. They must be filled with letters not eliminated.  

A common word fitting the pattern **L _ _ I D** using only allowed letters is **LUCID** (L‑U‑C‑I‑D).  
U and C have not been ruled out, and the word is valid English.

Thus the next guess should be “LUCID”.
