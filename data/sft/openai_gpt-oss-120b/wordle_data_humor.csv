### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
- From CRONY: C and N and Y are not in the word. R and O are in the word but in wrong positions (R not position 2, O not position 3).

So the secret word contains R and O, placed somewhere other than those positions. All other letters used so far are excluded.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and O, avoids the excluded letters, and puts them in positions that could be correct. Choose a word with new letters to gather more info.

Word candidate: MORPH (M O R P H)
- Contains O (position 2, allowed) and R (position 3, allowed).
- Uses only letters not excluded (M, O, R, P, H).

Thus MORPH is a valid next guess.
