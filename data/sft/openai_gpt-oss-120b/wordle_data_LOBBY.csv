### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “CRANE” indicated that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word.

We have three previous guesses:

1. CRANE → all letters are NOT in the secret word.
2. SHIFT → all letters are NOT in the secret word.
3. BLOOM → B(-), L(-), O(-), O(-), M(x)

From guess 3 we learn:
- B, L, and O are each in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in BLOOM (positions 1,2,3,4 respectively).
- M is not in the secret word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters B, L, O (maybe more than one O). The remaining two letters are still unknown but cannot be any of the letters already ruled out: C,R,A,N,E,S,H,I,F,T,M.

Our next guess should:
- Keep B, L, O to confirm them.
- Introduce a new letter to test another possibility.
- Change the positions of B, L, O to gather positional information.

The word **BLOOP** uses B, L, O, O (still testing O) and adds a new letter P, which has not been ruled out. It also places B, L, O in the same positions as before (which we know are incorrect), so the feedback will clearly tell us which positions are wrong and whether P is present.

Therefore the next guess is:

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From guess 3 we learn:
- B, L, and O are each in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in BLOOM (positions 1,2,3,4 respectively).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters B, L, O (maybe more than one O). The remaining two letters are still unknown but cannot be any of the letters already ruled out: C,R,A,N,E,S,H,I,F,T,M.

Our next guess should:
