### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:

- Letters C, A, N, E, F, U, T are not in the word (x).
- Letter I is in the word but not at position 4 (-).

“PRIOR” fits:
- R is at position 2.
- I is at position 3 (not position 4).
- No forbidden letters appear.
- All letters are valid English letters.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   → R is correct at position 2. C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. FRUIT → F(x) R(✓) U(x) I(-) T(x)  
   → R still correct at position 2. I is in the word but not at position 4. F, U, T are not in the word.

3. PRIOR → P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) O(x) R(-)  
   → Positions 1‑3 are now confirmed: P at 1, R at 2, I at 3. O is not in the word. The second R (position 5) is marked “-”, meaning the letter R is in the word but not at position 5. Since we already have an R correctly placed at position 2, this simply tells us that the secret word does **not** have an R at position 5; it does not require a second R.

Thus the current known pattern is:

- 1️⃣ P  
- 2️⃣ R  
- 3️⃣ I  
- 4️⃣ unknown (cannot be O, cannot be any previously ruled‑out letters)  
- 5️⃣ unknown (cannot be R, O, or any ruled‑out letters)

All letters that have been ruled out so far are: C, A, N, E, F, U, T, O.

We need a common English word that fits **P R I _ _** and uses only letters not in the exclusion list. A good candidate is **PRISM** (P‑R‑I‑S‑M). Both S and M are still possible letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “PRISM”.

   → R still correct at position 2. I is in the word but not at position 4. F, U, T are not in the word.

3. PRIOR → P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) O(x) R(-)  
   → Positions 1‑3 are now confirmed: P at 1, R at 2, I at 3. O is not in the word. The second R (position 5) is marked “-”, meaning the letter R is in the word but not at position 5. Since we already have an R correctly placed at position 2, this simply tells us that the secret word does **not** have an R at position 5; it does not require a second R.

Thus the current known pattern is:

- 1️⃣ P  
- 2️⃣ R  
- 3️⃣ I  
- 4️⃣ unknown (cannot be O, cannot be any previously ruled‑out letters)  
- 5️⃣ unknown (cannot be R, O, or any ruled‑out letters)

All letters that have been ruled out so far are: C, A, N, E, F, U, T, O.

We need a common English word that fits **P R I _ _** and uses only letters not in the exclusion list. A good candidate is **PRISM** (P‑R‑I‑S‑M). Both S and M are still possible letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “PRISM”.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: P (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)

Feedback from guess PRISM shows:
- Position 4: S is not in the word (x)
- Position 5: M is not in the word (x)

Eliminated letters from all guesses: C, A, N, E, F, U, T, O, S, M.

Thus the remaining unknown letters (positions 4 and 5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding those eliminated letters. Viable common words that start with “PRI” and use only allowed letters are limited. “PRIVY” (P‑R‑I‑V‑Y) fits all constraints: V and Y have not been ruled out, and the word is a valid English word.

Therefore the next guess should be “PRIVY”.
