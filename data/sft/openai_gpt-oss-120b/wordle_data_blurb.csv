### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is frequently used as an opening guess in word‑guessing games because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and the two most common vowels (A, E). This should give me a good spread of information for the next steps.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E. The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. I need a new five‑letter guess that avoids the excluded letters and places R somewhere else.

We know from the feedback:
- Letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (from “SPORT” feedback).

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ R _.  
All other letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common five‑letter word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters. “WHIRL” (W H I R L) satisfies:
- R is fourth.
- None of its letters are among the excluded ones.
- It is a valid English word.

So the next guess is “WHIRL”.
