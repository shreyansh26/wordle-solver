### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All letters from the first guess (C R A N E) are not in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters. Choosing a word with fresh common letters, especially another vowel, will give better information. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, T – none of which appeared in the first guess, so it’s a valid next attempt.

We know from previous guesses:
- C,R,A,N,E,M,G are not in the word.
- I is correct and in position 2.
- H is in the word but not in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

For the next guess we must keep I at the second spot and avoid all excluded letters. A good strategy is to introduce new letters while still respecting the known constraints. The word **SILOS** fits:
- Pattern _ I _ _ _: I is in the second position.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (S, L, O are all possible).
- Does not place H or T, which we can test in a later guess.
Thus it will give us information about three new letters without violating any known rules.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From MIGHT: I is correct in position 2; H and T are present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively; M, G, and other letters are absent.
- From SILOS: S in position 1 is correct; the second S indicates another S elsewhere in the word (so either 2 S’s total or a duplicate‑letter handling quirk); L and O are absent; I again correct.

Thus we know the word starts with **S I**.  
Letters still to place include H (not position 4) and T (not position 5).  
A good candidate that respects all positional constraints and introduces a new letter is **SIXTH** (S I X T H):  
- S is at position 1 (✓).  
- I is at position 2 (✓).  
- H is at position 5 (allowed, since H ≠ 4).  
- T is at position 4 (allowed, since T ≠ 5).  
- X is a fresh letter to test.
