### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 5.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (it was in position 3 in “CRANE”).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E, contains an A somewhere other than the third spot, and must avoid C, R, N.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints helps test new letters. “PAUSE” ends with E, has A in position 2 (which is allowed), and introduces P, U, S which we haven’t tested yet.

Thus the next guess is:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the pattern of the secret word based on feedback:
- Position 2 is A (from PAUSE).
- Position 5 is E (from CRANE, PAUSE, and FABLE).
- Letters C, R, N, P, U, S, F, B are not in the word.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 4 (it was ""-"" in FABLE at position 4), so L can be in position 1 or 3.

Thus the word must be of the form _ A _ _ E and contain an L at position 1 or 3.

A valid candidate that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **LATHE**:
- L A T H E fits the pattern.
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- No excluded letters are used.
- T and H are new letters to test.

Therefore the next guess will be LATHE.

We have determined the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 2 is **A** (confirmed from PAUSE and LATHE).
- Position 3 is **L** (L was marked “-” in both FABLE and LATHE, eliminating positions 1 and 4, leaving position 3).
- Position 5 is **E** (confirmed from CRANE, PAUSE, and LATHE).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, P, U, S, F, B, T, H, and also the earlier guesses' letters that got an “x”.
- The remaining unknown letters are at positions 1 and 4, and must be chosen from letters not yet excluded.

A common English word that satisfies the pattern **_ A L _ E** and uses only allowed letters is **VALVE**:
- V A L V E fits the pattern (V at positions 1 and 4, A at 2, L at 3, E at 5).
- V has not been ruled out yet, and the word introduces no prohibited letters.

Thus the next logical guess is “VALVE”.
