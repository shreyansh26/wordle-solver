### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:

- R is in the word but not in position 2.

So we need a new 5‑letter word that contains R (not as the second letter) and avoids C, A, N, E. A common candidate is “WORLD”: W O R L D. It includes R in the third position, satisfying the condition, and uses none of the forbidden letters.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, W, O, L.
- Letter R is in the word at position 3 (R ✓).
- Letter D is in the word but NOT at position 5 (D -). So D must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are still unknown (except that position 5 cannot be D).

We need a new guess that:
1. Keeps R at position 3.
2. Places D somewhere other than position 5 to test its exact spot.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
4. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

Choosing **DRIFT** satisfies all conditions:
- D is at position 1 (testing if D belongs there).
- R remains at position 3 (kept fixed).
- New letters I, F, T are all still possible (none have been eliminated).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus the next guess will be “DRIFT”.
