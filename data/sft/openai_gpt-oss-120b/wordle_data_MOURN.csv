### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback shows that positions 3, 4, and 5 are U, R, N respectively. The only common English word that fits the pattern __URN and uses letters not yet ruled out is **CHURN**. Even though C was previously marked absent, it’s the most plausible candidate to test the remaining possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The previous feedback tells us:
- C, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- R and N are in the word, but not in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"": R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4.

We need a new five‑letter guess that includes R and N in different positions, avoids C, A, and E, and tests new letters. A good choice is **RINGO**:
- R is placed at position 1 (different from position 2).
- N is placed at position 3 (different from position 4).
- Introduces new letters I, G, O for further clues.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, E are not in word. R and N are present but wrong positions (R not pos2, N not pos4).
- From RINGO: R still not correct (now at pos1), so R not pos1 either. N still not correct (now at pos3), so N not pos3 either. Letters I, G, O are not in word.

Thus eliminated letters: C, A, E, I, G, O.
R must be in positions 3,4,5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
N must be in positions 1,2,5 (cannot be 3 or 4).

We need a 5‑letter word containing R and N, using only allowed letters. The word **SPURN** fits:
- Contains R (position 4) and N (position 5), satisfying the position constraints.
- Uses letters S, P, U, which are not eliminated.
Thus SPURN is a legal, information‑rich next guess.
