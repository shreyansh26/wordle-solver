### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 confirmed).
- Letters **S** and **I** are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
  * S was guessed at position 1 → S cannot be at position 1.
  * I was guessed at position 3 → I cannot be at position 3.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, L, D** are not in the word.

We need a five‑letter word ending in **E**, containing **S** and **I** (with the positional constraints), and using none of the excluded letters.

The word **PISTE** satisfies all conditions:
- Ends with **E**.
- Contains **I** at position 2 (allowed) and **S** at position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- Uses only letters P, I, S, T, E, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus the next logical guess is “PISTE”.
