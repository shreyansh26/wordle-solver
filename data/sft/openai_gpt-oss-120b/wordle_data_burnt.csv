### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- N is correct at position 4.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- C, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Has N in the fourth position.
2. Contains R, but not in position 2.
3. Avoids the letters C, A, and E.

A good candidate is **ROUND**:
- Positions: R (1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5)
- N is correctly placed.
- R appears in position 1, satisfying the “R somewhere else” clue.
- O, U, D are new letters that we haven’t ruled out yet.
