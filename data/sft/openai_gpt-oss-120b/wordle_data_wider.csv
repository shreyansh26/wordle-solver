### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the known correct placements:
- Position 2 is I (from FIVER, I ✓).
- Position 4 is E (from ROLES, E ✓ and FIVER, E ✓).

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word: C, A, N, O, L, S, F, V, plus the previously ruled‑out letters from earlier guesses.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ I _ E R using only allowed letters. A good candidate that introduces two new letters (T and G) and fits the pattern is **TIGER**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Thus I need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, and places R and E in different slots from the first guess. “ROLES” satisfies all of these conditions (R at position 1, E at position 4, and introduces O, L, S as new letters to test).

- Letters that are in the word: R and E.
- E is correct at position 4 (from ROLES).

Thus the secret word must have E in the fourth slot and R somewhere else, but not in slots 1 or 2. Possible slots for R are 3 or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints, avoids all forbidden letters, and introduces new letters to test is **FIVER** (F I V E R):
- Position 4 is E, matching the known correct placement.
- R is at position 5, which is allowed.
- No prohibited letters are used.

This guess will confirm whether R is at position 5 and test the new letters F, I, and V.
