### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in word‑guessing games because it covers a consonant (C, R, N) and the two main vowels (A, E). This should provide a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and N, avoid C, R, E, and place A somewhere other than the third slot and N somewhere other than the fourth slot.

I need a new 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints and gives fresh letters to test. “ANVIL” uses A and N in allowed positions (A at 1, N at 2), and introduces the new letters V, I, L which haven’t been ruled out yet. None of its letters are C, R, or E. This should give useful next feedback.
