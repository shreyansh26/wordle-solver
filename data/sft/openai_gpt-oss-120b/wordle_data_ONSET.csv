### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain C, R, or A. It does contain N and E, but N is not in the 4th position and E is not in the 5th position. To gather more information, I’ll pick a word that includes N and E in new positions while using other common letters and avoiding C, R, A.
A good candidate is **ENVOY**: it has E in position 1 and N in position 2, satisfying the constraints, and introduces new letters (V, O, Y) for further clues.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, V, Y.
- N is in the word, placed correctly at position 2.
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 4.
- Remaining positions (1,3,4,5) must accommodate E and O respecting those position limits.

If we place E at position 4 (allowed) and O at position 1 (allowed), a common word that fits is **ONSET**:
- O (position 1) – O is present and not at position 4.
- N (position 2) – matches the confirmed N.
- S (position 3) – new letter, not excluded.
- E (position 4) – E is present and not at positions 1 or 5.
- T (position 5) – new letter, not excluded.

All constraints are satisfied, making “ONSET” a strong next guess.
