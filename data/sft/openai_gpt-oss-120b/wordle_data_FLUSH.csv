### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For an initial guess, I'll choose a common word with a mix of common letters and varied positions to gather useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both consonants and a vowel.

Thus H must appear in the secret word but not in position 4. All other letters used so far are eliminated.

Allowed letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus H, which must be in a different slot).

From the last feedback on SLUSH:
- Position 2: L is correct (✓) → L at spot 2.
- Position 3: U is correct (✓) → U at spot 3.
- Position 4: S is correct (✓) → S at spot 4.
- Position 5: H is correct (✓) → H at spot 5.
- The first S got a “-”, meaning S is in the word but not at position 1; that’s already satisfied because S is at position 4.

Thus the secret word has the pattern **_ L U S H**.  
The only remaining unknown is the first letter, which must be a letter not eliminated earlier (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,T,K) and not already used elsewhere. A common word fitting this pattern is **BLUSH**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Thus H must appear in the secret word but not in position 4. All other letters used so far are eliminated.

Allowed letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus H, which must be in a different slot).

We need a common 5‑letter English word using only these letters and placing H somewhere other than the fourth slot. A suitable candidate is **HULKS** (H at position 1, and U, L, K, S are all allowed letters).

Thus the secret word contains H, U, L, S plus one other letter.  
We need a word respecting those position restrictions.  
The word **SLUSH** uses exactly those four letters (S appears twice, which is allowed) and places them as:

The remaining possible first letters are among D, F, J, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. The common English word that fits ""?LUSH"" and uses allowed letters is **FLUSH** (F L U S H).
