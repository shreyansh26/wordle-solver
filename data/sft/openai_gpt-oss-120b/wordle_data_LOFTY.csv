### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H are not in the secret word.
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 5 (it got a “-” when guessed at position 5).

So the secret word must contain T somewhere in positions 1‑4. All other letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We want a word that places T in a different spot (not 5) and introduces new letters to test. “BOUTS” (B‑O‑U‑T‑S) uses only allowed letters, puts T at position 4, and checks B, O, U, and S.

We have fixed letters from feedback:
- Position 2: O (✓ from BOUTS and JOLTY)
- Position 4: T (✓ from BOUTS and JOLTY)
- Position 5: Y (✓ from JOLTY)
- Letter L is in the word but was in the wrong spot in JOLTY (position 3), so L cannot be position 3. The only remaining empty spots are positions 1 and 3. Position 2 is O, 4 is T, 5 is Y, so L must be at position 1. Therefore the pattern is **L O _ T Y**.

We need a valid English word matching L O ? T Y where the third letter is not among eliminated letters (A,B,C,E,G,H,I,J,M,N,R,S,U). The remaining candidates include D,F,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z. The common word **LOFTY** uses F at the third position, which is allowed. This fits the pattern perfectly.

Thus the next guess should be LOFTY.
