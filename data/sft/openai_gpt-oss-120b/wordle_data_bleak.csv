2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that:
- Position 2 is L (✓).
- S and T are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word with L in the second spot, containing A and E elsewhere (A not at 3, E not at 5), and avoiding S and T.

The word **CLEAN** fits:
- C L E A N → L is in position 2.
- A is in position 4 (allowed) and E is in position 3 (allowed).
- No S or T appears.

Thus CLEAN is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed letters:
- L at position 2 (✓)
- E at position 3 (✓)
- A at position 4 (✓)

Thus the secret word matches the pattern _ L E A _.

Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, T, C, N (all marked x).

We need a valid 5‑letter English word fitting _ L E A _ while avoiding the forbidden letters. Candidates include:
- BLEAK (B L E A K)
- GLEAM (G L E A M)
- PLEAD (P L E A D)

Choosing BLEAK introduces two new letters (B and K) and tests the final position.
