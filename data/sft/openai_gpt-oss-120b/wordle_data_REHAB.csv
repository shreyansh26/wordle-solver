### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that includes a mix of common letters and vowel placements to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good initial guess because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which will help identify key letters and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (R ≠ position 2, A ≠ position 3, E ≠ position 5).

I need a new guess that includes R, A, and E placed elsewhere, while avoiding C and N.  
Choosing the word **REGAL** gives:
- R in position 1 (allowed),
- E in position 2 (allowed, E only forbidden at position 5),
- A in position 4 (allowed, A only forbidden at position 3),
- No C or N present.

Thus REGAL satisfies all known constraints and introduces new letters G and L for more information.

- A in position 4 (allowed, A only forbidden at position 3),
- No C or N present.

Thus REGAL satisfies all known constraints and introduces new letters G and L for more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REGAL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is R (correct).
- Position 2 is E (correct).
- Position 4 is A (correct).
- Letters G, L, C, N are not in the word.
- Positions 3 and 5 are still unknown.
So the secret word fits the pattern **R E _ A _**.

We need a new word that keeps R, E, A in those exact spots and tries two fresh letters for positions 3 and 5. A good candidate is **RESAT**:
- R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, A at 4, T at 5.
- S and T have not been tested yet, giving us new information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:

- Position 2: E (✓)

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, G, L, S, T.

Thus the secret word pattern is **R E _ A _** with unknown letters at positions 3 and 5, none of which can be C, N, G, L, S, T.

We need a valid English word fitting that pattern and using letters not yet ruled out. Possible candidates include:
- **REPAY** (P and Y are new letters, both allowed)
- **REWAR** (W and R but repeats R; also not a common word)
- **REALM** (M at position 5, but L is forbidden)
- **REHAB** (H and B, but position 4 would be A, okay; however H and B are new and acceptable; however ""REHAB"" ends with B, not A? Actually REHAB = R E H A B fits pattern, B not excluded. Could also be used.)

Both ""REPAY"" and ""REHAB"" satisfy constraints. Choose one that introduces two fresh letters. ""REPAY"" introduces P and Y, both untested, giving maximum new information.

Thus the next guess is **REPAY**.

Choosing REHAB will test two new letters and should reveal whether either is correct.
