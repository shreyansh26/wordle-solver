### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich word that contains a mix of frequent consonants. “CRANE” has two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), which should give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know the secret word starts with C at position 1 and R at position 2 (C✓, R✓). Letters A, N, E are not in the word at all. For positions 3‑5 we need to test new letters while keeping the known prefix “CR”. A good candidate is **CRISP**, which introduces I, S, and P – three fresh letters that could occupy the remaining spots. This will give us more information for the next guesses.
