### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 4 = E (✓)

So the word pattern is **R O _ E _**.

Excluded letters from all previous “x” feedbacks: C, A, N, I, V, T, B, D, P, S.

The remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 5 are any letters not in that excluded set, and they may also include R, O, or E if duplicates are allowed. A common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **ROGER** (R‑O‑G‑E‑R). G is not excluded, and the second R is permissible because R is already known to be in the word.

Thus the next logical guess is “ROGER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- C is not in the word.

Feedback also tells us:
- D is in the word but not at position 5 → D must be at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at position 5 (the single R we already have at position 1 satisfies this).

All letters marked x are excluded: C, A, N, I, V, T, B, P, S, G, plus any others already ruled out.
