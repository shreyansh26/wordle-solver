### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or E. The letter N is in the word but not in the 4th position (its position in CRANE). Therefore we should guess a word that includes N in a different position and avoids the excluded letters. A good candidate is **SNOUT**: it places N in the 2nd spot and uses common letters S, O, U, T, none of which have been ruled out.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From SNOUT: S,U are not in the word. N, O, T are in the word but each is in the wrong position (N not position 2, O not position 3, T not position 5).

Thus required letters: N, O, T.
Position restrictions:
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- O cannot be in position 3.

All other letters must avoid the excluded set {C,R,A,E,S,U}.

The word **MONTH** uses the needed letters N, O, T and places them at positions 3, 2, and 4 respectively, satisfying all positional constraints, and its other letters (M, H) are not excluded. This makes it an excellent next guess.

We have the following information:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, M, H, plus any letters marked “x” in previous guesses.
- Letters that must be in the word: N, O, T.
- O is confirmed in the correct position: position 2 (from MONTH feedback O ✓).
- N is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 (from CRANE, SNOUT, MONTH). So N can only be in position 1 or 5.
- T is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from SNOUT, MONTH). So T can be in position 1, 2, or 3, but position 2 is already O, leaving positions 1 or 3.

Putting these constraints together, a viable pattern is:
1 ? 2 O 3 ? 4 ? 5 ?

We need to place N and T within the allowed spots. One arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
- T at position 1,
- O at position 2,
- X (a new letter) at position 3,
- I (another new letter) at position 4,
- N at position 5.

This yields the word **TOXIN**, which uses only allowed letters and respects all positional restrictions.

Thus the next guess should be “TOXIN”.
