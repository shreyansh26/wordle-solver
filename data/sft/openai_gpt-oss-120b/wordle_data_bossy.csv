### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Guess2 eliminated M,I,G,H,T.
- Guess3 gave B correct in position1, L eliminated, O present but not in position3, W eliminated, S present but not in position5.

Thus pattern: B _ _ _ _. Must include O and S somewhere not in those disallowed spots. O cannot be position3; S cannot be position5. Choose a common word fitting: ""BOSSY"" (B O S S Y) places O at pos2 (allowed), S at pos3 and 4 (allowed), Y is a new allowed letter. All letters are not eliminated.
