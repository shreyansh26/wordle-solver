### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess “crane” that C, R, and E are not in the secret word. The letters A and N are present but are in the wrong positions: A is not the 3rd letter and N is not the 4th letter.  

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains A and N.
- Does not contain C, R, or E.
- Places A somewhere other than the 3rd slot.
- Places N somewhere other than the 4th slot.

The word **ANVIL** satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A (position 1) and N (position 2).
- No C, R, or E.
- A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4.

Thus “anvil” is a logical next guess.
