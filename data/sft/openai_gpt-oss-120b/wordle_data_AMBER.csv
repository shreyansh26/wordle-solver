### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C and N are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"":
  * R cannot be in position 2.
  * A cannot be in position 3.
  * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains R, A, and E placed in different positions from the previous guess.
- Uses other letters to explore new possibilities.
- Avoids the forbidden letters C and N.

A good candidate is **RAGEL**:
- R is now in position 1 (different from position 2).
- A moves to position 2 (different from position 3).
- E moves to position 4 (different from position 5).
- The other two letters, G and L, are new and will give us fresh information.

Thus the next guess will be “RAGEL”.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, G, L.
- Letter E is correct in position 4.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3,5.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1 or 5.
- We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ _ _ E _.  

Considering the constraints:
- If A is at position 1, R can be at 5 (since R cannot be 1 or 2).  
- This yields the pattern **A _ _ E R**.

A common English word that fits this pattern and avoids the forbidden letters is **AFTER** (A‑F‑T‑E‑R).  
All constraints are satisfied:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).  
- R is at position 5 (allowed).  
- E is at position 4 (confirmed).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess:
- C and N are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"":
  * R cannot be in position 2.
  * A cannot be in position 3.
  * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains R, A, and E placed in different positions from the previous guess.
- Uses other letters to explore new possibilities.
- Avoids the forbidden letters C and N.

A good candidate is **RAGEL**:
- R is now in position 1 (different from position 2).
- A moves to position 2 (different from position 3).
- E moves to position 4 (different from position 5).
- The other two letters, G and L, are new and will give us fresh information.

Thus the next guess will be “RAGEL”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RAGEL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) G(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, G, L.
- Letter E is correct in position 4.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3,5.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1 or 5.
- We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ _ _ E _.  

Considering the constraints:
- If A is at position 1, R can be at 5 (since R cannot be 1 or 2).  
- This yields the pattern **A _ _ E R**.

A common English word that fits this pattern and avoids the forbidden letters is **AFTER** (A‑F‑T‑E‑R).  
All constraints are satisfied:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).  
- R is at position 5 (allowed).  
- E is at position 4 (confirmed).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be “AFTER”.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the secret word pattern is A _ _ E R.
Confirmed letters:
- A is correct at position 1.

- R is correct at position 5.
Letters ruled out so far: C, N, G, L, F, T.
The remaining unknown letters for positions 2 and 3 must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the ruled‑out letters. 

A good candidate that fits the pattern and uses two new letters is **ADDER** (A D D E R). It introduces the letter D in both remaining slots, giving us maximum information about whether D belongs in the word.

Thus the next guess will be “ADDER”.

We have determined the pattern A _ _ E R, with A (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5) confirmed. Eliminated letters are C, N, G, L, F, T, D. We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not eliminated. Common words fitting the pattern include **AMBER** (A M B E R) and **ASHER** (A S H E R). Both use only unused letters. Choosing a very common word gives a higher chance of being correct, so we will guess **AMBER**.
