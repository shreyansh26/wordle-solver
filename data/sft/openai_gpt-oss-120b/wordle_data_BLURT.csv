### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that the secret word does NOT contain C, A, N, or E. The letter R is present but placed in a different spot than position 2. For the next guess we should include R in a new position and avoid the excluded letters. A good candidate is **BURLY** (B‑U‑R‑L‑Y), which places R at position 3 and contains no prohibited letters.

From the last feedback on BLURB:
- Positions 1‑4 are correct: B L U R.
- Position 5 (B) is wrong, meaning the word does not have a second B.
So the secret word pattern is **B L U R ?**.

We need a valid English word that fits this pattern. The common word **BLURT** (meaning “to say something suddenly”) matches: B L U R T. The letter T has not been tried yet and is not in the excluded list (C, A, N, E, Y). Therefore BLURT is a logical next guess.
