We have confirmed that only the letter E is correct and in the 5th position. All other letters tried (C,R,A,N,S,L,O,P,B,U,D,G,W,H,I,T) are not in the word at any position.

Thus the secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, using only letters that have not been eliminated: F, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly additional E's).

We need a common English word that fits these constraints. “FEMME” is a valid English word (means a woman, often used in fashion). It uses only the allowed letters F, M, E and ends with E. This will test the new letters F and M (and also see if an additional E appears earlier).

So the next guess is:
