### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE we learned:

- A and N are in the word, but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (A not in position 3, N not in position 4).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N in different positions, avoids C, R, and E, and tests other letters. “MANGO” places A in position 2 and N in position 3, satisfying the position constraints, and introduces new letters M, G, and O for further information.

From the first guess:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

From the second guess (MANGO):
- M is not in the word.
- A is correct at position 2.
- N is in the word but not at position 3.
- G is in the word but not at position 4.
- O is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have A in position 2.
- Contain N (positions 1 or 5, but not 3 or 4).
- Contain G (not position 4).
- Contain O (not position 5).
- Use none of the excluded letters {C, R, E, M}.

The word **WAGON** fits all these constraints:
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- G is at position 3 (not position 4).
- O is at position 4 (not position 5).
- All other letters (W) are not prohibited.

Therefore, the next guess should be “WAGON”.
