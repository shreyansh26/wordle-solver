# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me:
- C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So I need a new 5‑letter word that includes C somewhere other than the first slot, and avoids using R, A, N, E. A good candidate is **SCOUT**: it places C in the second position and uses letters (S, O, U, T) that haven’t been ruled out.

We have these constraints from feedback:
- C is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2.
- U is in the word, but not in position 4.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, T (all marked x).
We need a 5‑letter English word that contains C and U, respects the positional constraints, and uses none of the excluded letters.  
The word **LUCID** satisfies all conditions:
- Contains C (position 3) and U (position 2).
- C is not in positions 1 or 2; U is not in position 4.
- The other letters L, I, D are not among the excluded set.
