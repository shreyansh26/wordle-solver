- E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

From the feedback:
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- Position 3 = E (✓)
- Position 4 = S (✓)
- Position 5 = T (✓) from “PREST”
- Position 1 is still unknown.
Letters ruled out for the first position: C (from “CRANE”), F, D, P, and any other letters marked “x”.  
The only common English word that fits the pattern _ R E S T and does not use any prohibited letters is **WREST** (W R E S T).  
Thus the next guess should be “WREST”.
