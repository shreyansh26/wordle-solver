### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

  - A is not in position 3.

We have the following feedback:

- From ADEPT: A, D, E, P are all in the word but misplaced; T is not in the word.

- D cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.
- P cannot be in position 4.

- L (new letter) at position 3,
- E at position 4 (allowed),
- D at position 5 (allowed).

All prohibited letters are avoided, and every known letter is placed in a permissible spot. Therefore, the next guess should be “PALED”.

- D cannot be in positions 2 (ADEPT) or 5 (PALED).
- E cannot be in positions 4 (PALED) or 5 (CRANE).

- D (3) – allowed.
- A (4) – allowed (A is not banned from position 4).
