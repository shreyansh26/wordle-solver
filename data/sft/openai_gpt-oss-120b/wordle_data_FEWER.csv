### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- C, A, N are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tries new letters. “PERIL” fits:
- Contains E (position 2, allowed) and R (position 3, allowed).
- Uses new letters P, I, L.
Thus it’s a good next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- C, A, N, P, I, L are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 2.
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3, so it can be at 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with E in the second slot, containing R in one of the allowed positions, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is **REBUT**:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 2 (matches the confirmed spot).
- B, U, T are new letters not ruled out yet.

Thus this guess will test several new letters while respecting all constraints.

- Position 5: R (confirmed)
- Position 1: F (since F was marked “-” in DEFER, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3; the only remaining open spot is position 1)
- Position 3: still unknown, but must be a letter not yet ruled out.

All letters marked “x” are excluded: C, A, N, P, I, L, B, U, T, S, V, D.  
Remaining possible letters include W, G, H, K, M, O, Q, Y, Z, etc.

The word that fits the pattern **F E _ E R** and uses only allowed letters is **FEWER** (F‑E‑W‑E‑R). “W” has not been tried yet, making this a logical final guess.
