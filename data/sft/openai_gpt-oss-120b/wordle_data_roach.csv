### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- A is correct at position 3.
- C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- N and E are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word with A in the third slot, includes C and R somewhere else, and avoids N and E. “SCARF” fits: S C A R F (A is third, C is not first, R is not second, and it contains no N or E).

We have confirmed:
- A is definitely at position 3.
- C is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4, so it must be at position 1 or 5.
- Letters N, E, S, and F are not in the word.

A valid arrangement is:
- R at position 1
- O at position 2 (unknown, not excluded)
- A at position 3 (fixed)
- C at position 4
- H at position 5 (unknown, not excluded)

The word “ROACH” satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Thus the next guess should be “ROACH”.
