### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that:

- N is correct at position 3.
- Y is correct at position 5.
All other guessed letters (P, K, etc.) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ I N _ Y.

The letters eliminated so far are S, L, A, T, E, C, R, U, M, B, P, K. Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 include D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, V, W, X, Z, and also N (since we only know N is at position 3, it could also appear elsewhere).

A common English word fitting the pattern is **HINNY** (a hybrid donkey‑horse). It uses H at position 1 and repeats N at position 4, both of which are still permissible.

Therefore, the next guess is “HINNY”.

From the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, U, M, B, P, K, H are not in the word.
- I is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- Y is correct at position 5.
- The N guessed at position 4 got a “‑”, meaning N exists in the word but not at position 4 (it’s already at position 3).

Thus the pattern is: _ I N _ Y, with only I, N, Y fixed.  
We need a common 5‑letter English word using only allowed letters (excluding the eliminated ones).  
“DINGY” fits perfectly: D I N G Y, uses allowed letters D and G for the unknown slots. It satisfies the pattern and avoids all excluded letters.
