### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get a broad sense of the secret word. “CRANE” is a good choice because it includes the letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know from the first guess that the secret word has A in the third position, and the letters C, R, N, and E are not present anywhere. The next guess should keep A fixed at position 3 and avoid using any of the excluded letters while introducing new letters to test possibilities. “SHALL” fits: it has A third, uses only S, H, L which we haven’t tested, and contains no forbidden letters.

We know the only confirmed letter is A in the third position. All letters C, R, N, E, S, H, L are not in the word at all. For the next guess we need a 5‑letter word with A third, using only new letters not yet excluded. A good candidate is **FOAMY** (F O A M Y): it keeps A in the correct spot and introduces four fresh letters (F, O, M, Y) that are all allowed.
