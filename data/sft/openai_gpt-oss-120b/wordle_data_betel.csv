### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all, and that the letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore the next guess must avoid C,R,A,N and place E somewhere other than the last slot. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more information.

The word “GELID” (meaning cold) is a valid 5‑letter English word. It contains E in the 2nd position, avoiding the last slot, and uses only letters (G, L, I, D) that haven’t been ruled out yet.

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (GELID): G, I, D are not in the word; E is correct at position 2; L is in the word but not at position 3.
- From guess 3 (LEVEL): Position 2 E is correct; Position 4 E is correct; Position 5 L is correct; Position 1 L is present elsewhere (so L is not at position 1); V is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern:
_ E _ E L
with known constraints:
- Position 2 = E
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = L
- Position 1 ≠ L
- Position 3 ≠ V
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, G, I, D, V, (and also B? not yet)
- Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 are any that have not been ruled out.

A common English word matching “_E_E L” and respecting the constraints is **JEWEL** (J E W E L). J and W have not been tried yet and are not excluded.

Therefore the next guess will be JEWEL.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
