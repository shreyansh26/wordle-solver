### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. For the next guess we should include C in a different slot and introduce new letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “MUSIC” places C at the end (position 5) and uses M, U, S, I, which we haven’t tested yet and none of which are forbidden.

We know:

- I is correct at position 4.
- C is correct at position 5.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 of “MUSIC”). So S must be in position 1 or 2.
The remaining unknown letters are positions 1‑3. We need to test new letters while keeping the known I‑C ending. A good word is **OPTIC** (O P T I C): it keeps I and C in the right spots and introduces three fresh letters (O, P, T) that haven’t been ruled out yet. It doesn’t contain S, which is fine because we’ll locate S in a later guess.
