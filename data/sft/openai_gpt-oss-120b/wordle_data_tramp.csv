2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback that:
- Position 2 must be R (✓)
- Position 3 must be A (✓)
- Letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
Thus the pattern is _ R A _ _. We need a new 5‑letter word with R in the second slot and A in the third, avoiding C, N, and E. “GRASP” fits: G R A S P, uses allowed letters and matches the known positions.
