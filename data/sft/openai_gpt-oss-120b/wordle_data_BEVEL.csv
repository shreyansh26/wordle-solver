### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters and positions:
- B is correct at position 1.
- E is correct at position 2.
- L is in the word but not at position 3 (from guess “BELOW”). Therefore L must be at position 4 or 5.
- All other letters guessed (C, R, A, N, D, U, T, O, W, I, G) are not in the word.
- E is not at position 5 (from the '-' feedback on the E in “CRANE” and “BEIGE”).

Thus the pattern is: **B E _ _ _** with L at position 4 or 5, and the remaining two letters must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., V, Z, Y, etc.). A common word that fits these constraints is **BEZEL** (B‑E‑Z‑E‑L): it keeps B and E in the known spots, places L at position 5, and introduces new letters Z and a second E to test whether the extra E and Z are correct.

This guess will tell us if the secret word is BEZEL or help narrow it down further (e.g., confirming L’s exact spot or ruling out Z).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
