### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has N in the 4th position (✓) and does not contain C, R, A, or E at any position (x). The next guess should therefore be a 5‑letter word with N as the fourth letter and avoiding the excluded letters. “GLINT” fits this pattern (G L I N T) and introduces new letters to test.

Current constraints:
- Position 3 = I (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓)
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 5 (from “-” feedback), so T must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters C, R, A, E, G, L are not in the word (x feedback).
- Positions 1,2,5 are still unknown, must avoid excluded letters and satisfy T placement.

A word that fits these constraints is **THINK**:
- T in position 1 (satisfies T being present, not at position 5)
- H in position 2 (new letter, not excluded)
- I in position 3 (✓)
- N in position 4 (✓)
- K in position 5 (new letter, not excluded, and not T)

Thus THINK is a valid next guess.
