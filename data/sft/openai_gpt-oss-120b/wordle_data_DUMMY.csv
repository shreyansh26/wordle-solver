### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, covering both consonants and a vowel.

All five letters from ""crane"" are confirmed absent, so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E. I need a new five‑letter guess using different letters. Choosing a common set that avoids those letters, I’ll try ""SLIMY"" (S, L, I, M, Y), which introduces new letters for more information.

We have confirmed that the secret word ends with “MY”, with M correctly placed at position 4 and Y at position 5. The letters C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I are not in the word. We need a new guess that keeps M and Y in those positions and introduces new letters to discover the first three positions. Choosing “dummy” adds D and U while also testing whether there is a second M at position 3 (since dummy has M at both positions 3 and 4). This will give us fresh information without reusing any excluded letters.
