### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- From ROBED: O, B, D are not in the word; R still not in position 1, and E still not in position 4.

Thus:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, O, B, D.
- R must be somewhere other than positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E must be somewhere other than positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2, or 3.

Choose a word that places R at position 3 and E at position 2, while using only allowed letters. “MERIT” fits:
- M E R I T
- R is at position 3 (allowed), E at position 2 (allowed).
- Contains only new letters M, I, T which are not excluded.

Positional constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → R must be in position 4 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 3.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **EVERY**:
- E is in position 1 (allowed) and also repeats at position 3 (still allowed).
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- The other letters V and Y have not been ruled out.
