### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that includes a mix of common letters and varied vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” covers two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and both a front vowel (A) and a back vowel (E), which should give a good spread of feedback.

We know from the feedback that the secret word ends with **E** (E is correct in position 5). The letters **C, R, A, N** are not present anywhere in the word. Therefore, our next guess must:

1. End with **E**.
2. Avoid using C, R, A, N in any position.

A good candidate that meets these criteria is **SLIDE** (S‑L‑I‑D‑E). It uses common letters, ends with E, and does not contain any of the excluded letters.

We know the secret word starts with S and ends with E (positions 1 and 5 are correct). All other letters from previous guesses are ruled out: C, R, A, N, L, I, D. So the pattern is S _ _ _ E, using only letters not in the excluded list. We need a valid word that fits this pattern and introduces new letters to narrow down the possibilities.

Possible candidates include:
- SHOVE (adds H, O, V)
- SPOKE (adds P, O, K)

Both words avoid the excluded letters. Choosing SPOKE tests three fresh letters (P, O, K) in one go, giving us more information for the remaining attempts.
