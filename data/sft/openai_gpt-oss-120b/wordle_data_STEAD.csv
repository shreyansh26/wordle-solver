### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the third position (the position it occupied in CRANE).

Thus the next guess must contain the letter A in a different slot (1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid the letters C, R, N, E entirely.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, I select **BALMY**:
- Contains A in the second position (different from position three).
- Uses only letters B, L, M, Y besides A, none of which have been ruled out.

We need a 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains A in one of those allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z (and of course A).

A good candidate is **AUDIO**: A is in position 1, and the remaining letters U, D, I, O are all still possible. This guess will tell us whether A is indeed in position 1 and which of the other letters, if any, belong in the secret word.

Guess 2: BALMY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) L(x) M(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: AUDIO -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(-) I(x) O(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from earlier feedback:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- D is in the word but not in position 3.
- All other letters tried (C, R, N, E, B, L, M, Y, U, I, O) are not in the word.

We still need to determine the exact positions of A and D and find the remaining three letters.  
A good next guess should:
* Include A and D to confirm their presence and get information about their correct spots.
* Introduce new, untested consonants such as S, T, N (though N is already known to be absent) to test other possibilities.

“STAND” contains A and D and brings in S and T, giving us fresh information while still respecting what we know about A and D (the feedback will indicate they are in the word but in the wrong positions if they’re not where we placed them). This will narrow down the remaining possibilities.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
   - Letters C, R, N are not in the word.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. BALMY → B(x) A(-) L(x) M(x) Y(x)  
   - B, L, M, Y are not in the word.  
   - A is also not in position 2.

3. AUDIO → A(-) U(x) D(-) I(x) O(x)  
   - U, I, O are not in the word.  
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - A is also not in position 1.

4. STAND → S(✓) T(✓) A(-) N(x) D(✓)  
   - S is correct at position 1.  
   - T is correct at position 2.  
   - D is correct at position 5.  
   - N is not in the word.  
   - A is in the word but not at position 3.

From these clues:
- Positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed as S, T, D.
- A cannot be in positions 1‑3 or 5, so A must be in position 4.
- E must be somewhere in the word and is not at position 5; the only remaining open slot is position 3.

Thus the hidden word is **S T E A D**.

Now we will submit that as the next guess.
