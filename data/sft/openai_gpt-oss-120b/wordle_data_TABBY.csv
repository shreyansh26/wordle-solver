### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “crane” gave feedback that C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word, while A is present but in the wrong spot (it cannot be the 3rd letter). Therefore the next guess must include A in a different position and must avoid using C, R, N, and E. A good candidate is “ADIOS”, which places A at the first position and introduces new letters D, I, O, and S for further testing.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains A in a possible position (2,4,5) and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out. “VAULT” puts A in position 2 and introduces four new letters (V, U, L, T) that have not been eliminated, giving us maximum information for the next round.

We have established the following from previous feedback:
- Position 1: T (confirmed from ""taffy"")
- Position 2: A (confirmed from ""vault"")
- Position 5: Y (confirmed from ""taffy"")
- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S, V, U, L, F
- Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4 are from {B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Z, etc.}
We need a valid English word matching the pattern T A _ _ Y using only allowed letters for the blank spots. ""TABBY"" fits perfectly (T‑A‑B‑B‑Y) and introduces the new letter B, which has not been ruled out.
