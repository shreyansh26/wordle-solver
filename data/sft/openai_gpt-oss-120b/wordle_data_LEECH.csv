### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but **not** in position 1.
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5.
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain C and E, placed differently than in “CRANE”.  
I need a new five‑letter guess that:
1. Includes C and E.
2. Puts C somewhere other than the first slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.
3. Avoids the excluded letters R, A, N.
4. Introduces a few new letters to gather more information.

The word **DECOY** satisfies all conditions:
- D E C O Y
- C is in position 3 (not position 1) and E is in position 2 (not position 5).
- It contains no R, A, or N.
- It adds the new letters D, O, and Y for further testing.

Thus, the next guess will be “DECOY”.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- The secret word contains the letter **E** in the **second position** (E is a ✓ from DECOY).
- The secret word also contains the letter **C**, but **not** in position 1 (from CRANE) nor in position 3 (from DECOY). Therefore C can only be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: **R, A, N, D, O, Y** (all marked x).

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Keeps **E** at position 2.
2. Places **C** at a possible remaining spot (position 4 works nicely).
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been eliminated.
4. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

The word **BELCH** satisfies all these constraints:
- Pattern: B E L C H
- E is correctly placed at position 2.
- C is at position 4 (one of the allowed spots).
- New letters B, L, and H have not been tried yet.
- No prohibited letters are used.

We have gathered the following information:

- Position 4 is **C** (confirmed by BELCH).
- Position 5 is **H** (confirmed by BELCH).
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 3 (it was “-” in BELCH). The only remaining empty slots are positions 1 and 3, so **L** must be at position 1.
- Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, D, O, Y, B.

Thus the word pattern is: **L E _ C H**.  
We need a valid English word fitting this pattern, using a new letter at position 3 that hasn’t been eliminated. The word **LEECH** satisfies the pattern (L‑E‑E‑C‑H) and introduces no prohibited letters. It also tests whether the secret word contains a second E.

- Position 5 is **H** (confirmed by BELCH).
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 3 (it was “-” in BELCH). The only remaining empty slots are positions 1 and 3, so **L** must be at position 1.
- Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, D, O, Y, B.

Thus the word pattern is: **L E _ C H**.  
We need a valid English word fitting this pattern, using a new letter at position 3 that hasn’t been eliminated. The word **LEECH** satisfies the pattern (L‑E‑E‑C‑H) and introduces no prohibited letters. It also tests whether the secret word contains a second E.

Therefore the next guess is:",Guess 4: LEECH -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) E(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
