### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed at position 5).

Thus the secret word must contain an E somewhere in positions 1‑4, and cannot contain S, L, A, T anywhere.

We need a new 5‑letter word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more info. “COVER” places E at position 4 (valid) and uses letters C, O, V, R that we haven’t tested yet, with R in the 5th slot (allowed). All letters are permissible under the known restrictions.
