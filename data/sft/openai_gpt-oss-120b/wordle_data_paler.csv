### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (R not 2nd, A not 3rd, E not 5th).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E, avoids C and N, and places those known letters in different spots. “SMEAR” fits:
- S M E A R uses all required letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed), A in position 4 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed).
- No C or N present.

Thus “SMEAR” is a logical next guess.
