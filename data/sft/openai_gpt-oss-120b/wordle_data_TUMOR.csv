### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information quickly. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E. This will give us useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have gathered the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Excluded letters (x): C, A, N, E, W, L, D, S, M.
- Present letters (‑) that are in the word but not in the indicated positions:
  * R is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 → R can be at position 1 or 5.
  * O is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 → O can be at position 1, 4, or 5.
  * T is in the word, but NOT in position 2 → T can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter English word that includes R, O, and T respecting these position limits and uses no excluded letters.

The word **TUTOR** fits perfectly:
- T at positions 1 and 3 (allowed, not position 2)
- O at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- R at position 5 (allowed, not 2, 3, or 4)
- All other letters (U) are not in the excluded list.

Thus, “TUTOR” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- The letters T, U, O, R are correctly placed at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 respectively.
- The third position is still unknown but must be a letter that is in the word (since the third T was marked “–”) and not any of the letters already ruled out (C, A, N, E, W, L, D, S, M). The only viable letter that fits all previous clues is **M**, forming the word **TUMOR**.
Thus the secret word is “TUMOR”, and guessing it will complete the game.
