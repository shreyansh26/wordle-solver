### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us:
- S, T, and E are not in the secret word.
- L and A are in the word but are in the wrong positions (L is not position 2, A is not position 3).

We need a new word that:
1. Includes L and A, but places them elsewhere.
2. Avoids the letters S, T, and E.

Choosing “BALMY” works:
- B A L M Y contains both A and L.
- A is in position 2 (different from the previous position 3).
- L is in position 3 (different from the previous position 2).
- No prohibited letters (S, T, E) appear.

Thus “BALMY” is a valid next guess.
