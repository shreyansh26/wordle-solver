### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE was completely wrong; every letter received an ""x"", indicating that none of C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that uses none of the excluded letters and introduces several new letters, especially other common vowels and consonants, to gather more information. “SHOUT” contains S, H, O, U, T, all of which are still possible.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From SHOUT: S, H, U, T are not in the word, and O is correct in position 3.

Thus the secret word has O at the third position, and cannot contain any of the letters C,R,A,N,E,S,H,U,T. Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter word with O as the third letter using only allowed letters. “BLOOM” fits: B L O O M uses none of the excluded letters and places O at position 3 (and also at position 4, which is permissible). It’s a valid English word, so it’s a good next guess.

O is correct at position 3, and an additional O exists elsewhere (since the second O got a '-' hint). So the secret word contains two O’s, one at position 3 and another at a different position (1, 2, or 5). Remaining possible letters are D,F,G,I,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. We need a common five‑letter word with this pattern. “WOOZY” fits: it uses only allowed letters, has O at positions 2 and 3 (so O at position 3 is correct, and the extra O is elsewhere, matching the '-' feedback). It’s a valid English word.

We have confirmed:
- O is correct at position 3.
- There is a second O, not at positions 2 or 4, so it must be at position 1 or 5.
- All letters C,R,A,N,E,S,H,U,T,B,L,M,W,Z,Y are ruled out.
- Remaining possible letters are D, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, V, X.

We need a common 5‑letter word with O at the third spot and another O either at the first or fifth spot, using only the allowed letters.  
The word **OVOID** fits perfectly: O V O I D → O at positions 1 and 3, the other letters V, I, D are all still possible.
