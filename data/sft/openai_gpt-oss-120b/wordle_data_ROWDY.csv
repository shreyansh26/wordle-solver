### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from prior feedback that the secret word does not contain the letters S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, P. The letter R is present but not in the 4th position (since CHIRP gave a '-' for R). Therefore we need a word that includes R in a position other than 4, and avoids all excluded letters. Choosing a word with many new letters will give the most information. ""DRUNK"" (D‑R‑U‑N‑K) contains R in position 2 and introduces four fresh letters D, U, N, K that have not been tested yet, and none of its letters have been ruled out. This makes it a strong next guess.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position2 = O (✓ from WORDY).
- Position4 = D (✓).
- Position5 = Y (✓).
- R is present (from earlier) and not in positions 2,3,4. Position5 is Y, so R must be position1.
- W is present (from WORDY) and not in position1, so it must be position3 (the only remaining slot).
Thus the word pattern is R O W D Y, which forms the valid English word ""ROWDY"".
We will guess this word.
