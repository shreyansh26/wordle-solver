### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I want to start with a common starter word that covers frequent letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. “CRANE” includes two common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N), which should give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Our next guess must include R and E, place them in allowed positions, and avoid C, A, N. A good candidate is **ROVER**:
- R in position 1 (allowed) and again in position 5 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- Uses new letters O and V to gather more information.
