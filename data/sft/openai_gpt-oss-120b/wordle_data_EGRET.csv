### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from BERTH). It can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, B, H, plus any others inferred (none else yet).

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ _ R _ _. Include E and T in allowed positions, avoid excluded letters, and introduce new letters to test further.

The word **STREW** fits:

- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- T is at position 2 (not position 4, allowed).
- Uses new letters S and W, and contains no excluded letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERTH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-) H(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- R is confirmed in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERTH). So E can be at position 1 or 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from BERTH). It can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, B, H, plus any others inferred (none else yet).

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ _ R _ _. Include E and T in allowed positions, avoid excluded letters, and introduce new letters to test further.

The word **STREW** fits:
- R is at position 3 (✓).
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- T is at position 2 (not position 4, allowed).
- Uses new letters S and W, and contains no excluded letters.

Thus we will guess “STREW”.

Guess 3: STREW -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) R(✓) E(✓) W(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed the following from feedback:
- Position 3 is R (✓ from guess 2 and 3).
- Position 4 is E (✓ from guess 3).
- Letter T is in the word, but it is not in positions 2 or 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 3). The only remaining possible spots for T are position 1 or position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, B, H, S, W (all marked x).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ R E _.  
We need T at position 1 or 5, and the remaining two letters must be unused letters not yet excluded.

A common word that satisfies these constraints is **TIRED**:
- T in position 1 (allowed for T)
- I and D are new letters not yet tested
- R in position 3, E in position 4 as required.

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters and confirm T’s correct placement.

We have determined the confirmed letters:
- R is definitely in position 3 (from guesses 2‑4).
- E is definitely in position 4 (from guess 3).
- T is definitely in position 5 (since T was ruled out from positions 1‑4).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **__RET**.

Letters that have been eliminated (marked “x”) are: A, B, C, D, H, I, N, S, W, plus any repeats of those. The remaining unused letters that could occupy positions 1 and 2 are among {F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z}.

A common English word that matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **MURET** (a low wall or fence). This fits all constraints and introduces new letters M and U for further testing.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
