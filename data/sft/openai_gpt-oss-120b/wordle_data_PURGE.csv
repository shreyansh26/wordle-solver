### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know:
- Secret word ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing R in a position other than 2, and avoiding C, A, N.

Possible candidates: “ROUSE”, “RIDER”, “FROZE”, “GRIME”, etc. “ROUSE” fits all constraints (R at position 1, ends with E, no forbidden letters). It’s a valid common English word.

Thus we will guess “ROUSE”.

From the feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 confirmed).
- Letters **R** and **U** are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses.
  * R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) nor position 1 (from ROUSE). So R can be in position 3 or 4.
  * U cannot be in position 3 (from ROUSE). So U can be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, O, S, plus any other letters that got an “x”.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in **E**, containing **R** and **U**, obeying the position rules, and avoiding the excluded letters.

The word **PURGE** fits:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 3) and U (position 2), both not in forbidden spots.
- Uses letters P, G which have not been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters are present.

Thus the next guess should be “PURGE”.
