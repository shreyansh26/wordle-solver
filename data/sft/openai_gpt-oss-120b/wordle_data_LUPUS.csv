### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → all letters not in the word.
- Guess 2: MIGHT → all letters not in the word.
- Guess 3: FLOWS → F, O, W are not in the word; L is in the word but in the wrong spot (not position 2); S is correct in position 5.
- Guess 4: BULKS → B, K are not in the word; U is correct in position 2; L is in the word but still in the wrong spot (not position 3); S is correct in position 5.

Thus the pattern is:

1 ? 2 U 3 ? 4 ? 5 S  
L must be somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (it cannot be 2, 3, or 5).  

Remaining possible letters (not ruled out) are: D, J, L, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5‑letter word of the form **L U _ _ S** (L at position 1) or **_ U _ L S** (L at position 4).  

A common word that fits the first pattern and uses only allowed letters is **LUPUS** (L U P U S).  
It places L at position 1, U at position 2 (already confirmed), and S at position 5 (already confirmed). The letters P and the repeated U have not been eliminated, so this guess will give us new information.

Therefore the next guess is:
