### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and varied positions. “SLATE” contains two common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (S, L, T), which should give useful information about the secret word.

We have feedback from the first guess SLATE:
- S is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- L is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 5.

Therefore the secret word ends with **E** and must contain **S** and **L** in different positions (S not first, L not second). We need a new 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints and avoids A and T.

A good candidate is **LOUSE**:
- Ends with E (position 5 correct).
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L cannot be position 2).
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since S cannot be position 1).
- No A or T letters are present.

Thus we can submit “LOUSE” as the next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (SLATE): S is in the word but not position 1; L is in the word but not position 2; A, T are not in the word; E is correct at position 5.
- From guess 2 (LOUSE): L is correct at position 1; O is correct at position 2; U is not in the word; S is correct at position 4; E is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **L O _ S E**, with the third letter still unknown. It cannot be A, T, or U. A common English word that fits this pattern is **LOOSE** (L O O S E). The repeated O is allowed because we have no feedback that forbids another O.

Therefore the next guess should be “LOOSE”.
