### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starter is **CRANE** – it uses two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) in different positions, which should provide a clear pattern of which letters are in the secret word and where.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. Therefore the next guess must avoid those letters entirely and try a set of new letters to gather more information. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word using only letters not previously eliminated: M, I, G, H, T. This gives a good mix of consonants and a vowel (I) while staying clear of C, R, A, N, E.
