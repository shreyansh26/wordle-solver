### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that:
- C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a second guess that includes C in a different position and avoids the forbidden letters. Choosing a word with C in position 2‑5 will give us new information about the remaining letters.

""SCOUT"" meets these criteria:
- C is in position 2 (different from the first guess).
- It contains no R, A, N, or E.
- It introduces new letters S, O, U, and T to test.

Thus, the next guess will be ""SCOUT"".
