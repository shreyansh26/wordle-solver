### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Since this is the first attempt, I have no information about the secret word. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word that uses a mix of frequent letters and includes no repeated letters, which will give me the most useful information for the next round. “CRANE” is a good starter word.

- Position 3 = I (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)

Feedback shows letters C, A, N, B, D, P, Z, T are not in the word at all.

We need a word of the form _ R I _ E using only letters not excluded. Viable candidates include **GRIME** (G R I M E) and possibly others, but GRIME introduces two new letters (G and M) that haven't been tested and forms a common English word fitting the pattern.
