### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Constraints from feedback:

- E is NOT in positions 4 or 5.
- L is NOT in position 3.
- Letters C, R, N, P, D are definitely NOT in the word.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing A, E, L that respects those position restrictions and avoids the forbidden letters.

The word **BLEAT** fits perfectly:
- B (allowed)

- E in position 3 (allowed, E is only banned from positions 4 and 5)
- A in position 4 (allowed, A is only banned from positions 2 and 3)

No prohibited letters appear, and all known letters are placed correctly. This makes BLEAT an ideal next guess.
