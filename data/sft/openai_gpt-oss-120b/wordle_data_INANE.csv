We have confirmed that the last three letters are A N E (positions 3‑5). The letters C, R, P, L, T, H, D, and W are not in the word at all, so the first two letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z). 

Finding a common English word of the form __ANE with two of those remaining letters is difficult; many possibilities are obscure or proper nouns. To gain more information, I will try a plausible candidate that uses two unused letters: **S K A N E**. This introduces S and K, which have not yet been tested, and follows the required pattern.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that positions 3‑5 are A N E from all prior feedback. The letters C, R, P, L, T, H, D, W, S, K are all excluded (marked x).  
Thus the secret word must be of the form __ANE with the first two letters drawn from the remaining alphabet (B, F, G, I, J, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and possibly A itself).  
A relatively obscure but valid English word fitting __ANE is **AZANE** (a chemical name for ammonia). It introduces the new letter Z, obeys the known pattern, and uses only allowed letters.
