### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with C. Letters R, A, N are not in the word at all. Letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore E must be in position 2, 3, or 4. I’ll choose a word that keeps C in the first spot, places E in the middle, and avoids R, A, N. “CLEFT” fits: C L E F T. It satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters L, F, T for further testing.

We have established:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- Position 5 is T (✓).
- Letters R, A, N, L, F are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 → therefore E is in position 2 or 4.
We need a new word C _ _ _ T, placing E in position 2 or 4, using letters we haven’t tested yet.

Word “COVET” fits:
- C (pos1) ✓
- O (new)
- V (new)
- E (pos4) – allowed (E is not in pos3 or 5)
- T (pos5) ✓

Thus “COVET” gives fresh information about O and V and confirms the placement of E.
