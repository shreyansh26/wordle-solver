2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get a lot of information about the secret word. “SLATE” is a good choice because it includes the vowels A and E and the frequent consonants S, L, and T.

We know from the first guess:
- S, T, E are not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains L and A, places them in different positions than before, and avoids S, T, and E.  
“MOLAR” satisfies these constraints: it includes L (now in position 3) and A (position 4), and uses only new letters M, O, R, which have not been ruled out.
