### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess ""crane"" we have:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- E is correct in the 5th position.

So the secret word looks like _ _ _ _ E, contains A somewhere other than position 3, and cannot contain C, R, or N.

I need a new 5‑letter word ending with E, that includes A in a different position, and introduces new letters to gather more clues. “waste” fits: W A S T E (A in position 2, E in position 5, and no prohibited letters). This will test the letters W, S, and T while keeping the known constraints.

- Letters C, R, N, W, S, T are not in the word.
- Letters A and E are already placed.

The pattern is: _ A _ _ E.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern that uses only letters not yet eliminated, and ideally introduces new letters for more information.

Possible candidates include ""fable"" (F A B L E) and ""gauge"" (G A U G E). Both fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters. ""FABLE"" adds three fresh letters (F, B, L) which will give us useful new clues.

Thus the next guess will be ""fable"".

- Position 2 is A (from ""waste"": A is ✓).
- Position 5 is E (from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, N, W, S, T are not in the word.
- Letters A and E are already placed.

The pattern is: _ A _ _ E.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern that uses only letters not yet eliminated, and ideally introduces new letters for more information.

Possible candidates include ""fable"" (F A B L E) and ""gauge"" (G A U G E). Both fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters. ""FABLE"" adds three fresh letters (F, B, L) which will give us useful new clues.

Thus the next guess will be ""fable"".

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, W, S, T, F, B.

Thus the word must be of the form **_ A _ L E** with none of the eliminated letters.

A good candidate that fits this pattern and introduces new, untested letters is **MAPLE** (M A P L E). It respects all known constraints and tests the new letters M and P.

So the next guess will be ""maple"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
