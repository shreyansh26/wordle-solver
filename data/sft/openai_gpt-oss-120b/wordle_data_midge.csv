# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 is correct).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, S, T** are not in the word at all.
- Letters **M** and **I** are in the word but are not in the positions they appeared in the second guess:
  - **M** was in position 2 of “SMITE”, so M cannot be in position 2.
  - **I** was in position 3 of “SMITE”, so I cannot be in position 3.
- Position 1 cannot be C or S; position 2 cannot be R or M; position 3 cannot be A or I; position 4 cannot be N or T.

We need a 5‑letter English word that:
- Ends with **E**,
- Contains **M** and **I** (placed elsewhere than the prohibited spots),
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, S, T).

A suitable candidate is **GIMME**:
- Ends with E,
- Contains I (position 2, allowed) and M (positions 3 and 4, allowed),
- Introduces a new letter G that hasn’t been ruled out.

Thus we’ll guess “GIMME”.

3. GIMME → G -, I ✓, M -, M -, E ✓ → I is correct at position 2, E at 5; G, M are in the word but not at the positions they appeared. Since M cannot be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, it must be at position 1. G cannot be at position 1 (and not at 5 because that’s E), so G must be at position 3 or 4.

Thus the pattern is:

- Position 5: E  
- G is at position 3 or 4.

- D is a new letter not yet ruled out.
