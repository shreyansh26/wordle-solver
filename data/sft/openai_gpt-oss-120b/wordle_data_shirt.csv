### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, M, O, P.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R (not position 2 or 3), H (not position 5).

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both R and H, avoids the excluded letters, and does not place R in positions 2 or 3 and H not in position 5.

The word **WHIRL** fits:
- Contains R (position 4) and H (position 2), both not in the forbidden spots.
- Uses only new letters W, I, L besides R and H, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus, the next guess will be WHIRL.

We have determined the confirmed letters:

- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: R (✓)

All other letters guessed so far are not in the word: C, A, N, E, M, O, P, W, L, plus the excluded letters from earlier guesses.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ H I R _. The remaining unknown letters are at positions 1 and 5. They must be letters we haven’t ruled out.

Possible English words fitting this pattern include:
- SHIRT (S _ H I R T)
- SHIRK (S _ H I R K)
- THIRD (T _ H I R D)

Choosing a guess that tests two new letters is optimal. “SHIRT” introduces S at position 1 and T at position 5, both still possible. It also respects all known constraints.

Therefore the next guess will be SHIRT.
