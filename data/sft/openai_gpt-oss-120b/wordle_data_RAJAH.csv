### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have these constraints from feedback:
- Position 2 is definitely A (A✓ from second guess).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (obviously) and not in position 3 (R- from second guess). So R can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters C, N, E, O, T are not in the word (all marked x).
- Remaining positions (1,3,4,5) must be filled with letters other than the excluded ones and must include R in one of the allowed spots.

A good candidate respecting all constraints is **RAILS**:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (confirmed).
- I, L, S are new letters not yet ruled out.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus, “RAILS” is a logical next guess.

- Contains no prohibited letters.

Thus the next logical guess is “RADAR”.

We have pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1: R is correct (✓).
- Position 2: A is correct (✓).
- Position 3: D was marked x, so D is not in the word.
- Position 4: A is correct (✓).
- Position 5: R was marked -, meaning R is in the word but not in this position; since R is already correctly placed at position 1, the extra R at position 5 must be absent.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **R A _ A _**.

Letters eliminated so far (marked x) are: C, N, E, T, O, I, L, S, D. Also the extra R at position 5 is not allowed.

Remaining possible letters for the unknown positions 3 and 5 are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word matching R A ? A ?. “RAJAH” fits this pattern, using J and H which are still allowable. It is a recognized word (meaning a ruler, also spelled “raja”). Therefore the next guess will be **RAJAH**.
