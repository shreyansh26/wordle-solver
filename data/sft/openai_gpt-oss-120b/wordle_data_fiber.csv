# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, puts R somewhere other than position 2, and puts E somewhere other than position 5.

Eliminated letters from previous guesses: C, A, N, M, I, T, O, D.

Remaining letters to use are any not eliminated, plus we must include another R somewhere in positions 1‑3 (but not position 2). A common English word that fits the pattern _ _ _ E R with an R at position 1 and no forbidden letters is **RULER** (R at 1, U at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5). This respects all constraints and tests new letters U and L.

Thus the next guess is:

We have confirmed:
- Position 4 is E (green from ORDER and RULER).
- Position 5 is R (green from ORDER and RULER).
- Letters C, A, N, M, I, T, O, D, U, L are not in the word (gray feedback).
- R is present (but only at position 5, since the earlier yellow marks can be satisfied by the same R).
- E is present (at position 4).

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ E R, using only letters not yet excluded. A valid English word fitting this pattern and avoiding the excluded letters is **SHEER**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Here is some previous feedback:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, puts R somewhere other than position 2, and puts E somewhere other than position 5.  
“MERIT” satisfies all these constraints:
- Contains R (at position 3) and E (at position 2).
- No C, A, or N.
- Neither R nor E is in a previously ruled‑out spot.
Thus I’ll guess “MERIT”.

Letters eliminated so far: C, A, N, M, I, T.

We need a new word that includes R and E in allowed spots and introduces new letters to test other positions.  
Choosing **ORDER**:
- R is placed at position 5 (allowed).
- E is placed at position 4 (allowed).
- Introduces O and D to gather more information.
- Uses no eliminated letters.

Thus this guess satisfies all current constraints while probing new letters.
