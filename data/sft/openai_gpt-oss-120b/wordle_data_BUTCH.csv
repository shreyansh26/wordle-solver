### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C is in the secret word but not in the first position (C(-)).

So the secret word must contain C somewhere in positions 2‑5, and cannot contain R, A, N, or E.

So the secret word pattern is _ U _ C _. We need a common 5‑letter word using allowed letters (B, F, G, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z, etc.) that fits the pattern.

The word **GULCH** fits perfectly:
- G (position 1) – not excluded.
- U (position 2) – confirmed.
- L (position 3) – allowed.
- C (position 4) – required location for C.
- H (position 5) – allowed.

Thus the next guess is GULCH.

From the feedback:
- Position 2 is U (confirmed).
- Position 4 is C (confirmed).
- Position 5 is H (confirmed).
- The letter C cannot be in positions 1,3,5, so it must be position 4, which matches.
- Excluded letters (x): R, A, N, E, M, S, I, D, K, Y, G, L.
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 are among B, F, J, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a word matching the pattern _ U _ C H using allowed letters. “BUTCH” (B‑U‑T‑C‑H) fits perfectly and uses only letters not excluded.
