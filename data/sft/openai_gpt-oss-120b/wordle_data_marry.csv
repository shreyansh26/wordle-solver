### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on ""SLATE"":
- S, L, T, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next guess must exclude S, L, T, E and place A in a different slot. I’ll choose a word that includes A plus four other common letters that haven't been ruled out. “BRAIN” fits: it has A (in a new position) and uses B, R, I, N, none of which have been eliminated.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Position 2 = A (correct)
- Position 3 = R (correct)
- Position 5 = Y (correct)
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, B, I, N, C, G, O, H, D
- Unknown letters are positions 1 and 4, which must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (U, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, etc.) without using any eliminated letters.

We need a valid English word of the form **_ A R _ Y** using only allowed letters. Common candidates include:

- **MARRY** (M A R R Y) – M is not eliminated, and a second R is permissible.
- **PARRY** (P A R R Y) – P is also allowed.

Both are acceptable guesses. I’ll choose **MARRY** as the next guess.
