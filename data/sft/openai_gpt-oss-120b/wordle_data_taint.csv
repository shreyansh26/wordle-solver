### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that:
- N is correct in the 4th position.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that places N in the 4th slot, includes A somewhere other than the 3rd slot, and avoids C, R, and E.  
“ALONG” fits these constraints:

We have determined the pattern _ A I N T from previous feedback:
- Positions 2-5 are confirmed: A, I, N, T.
- First letter is not S, F, C, R, E, L, O, G.
Possible words fitting _AINT are PAINT and TAINT (SAINT and FAINT already eliminated). To differentiate, guess PAINT; if all letters are correct, the secret is PAINT; if the first letter is wrong, we’ll learn it’s TAINT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess that:
- N is correct in the 4th position.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that places N in the 4th slot, includes A somewhere other than the 3rd slot, and avoids C, R, and E.  
“ALONG” fits these constraints:
- N is in the 4th position.
- A is in the 1st position (not the 3rd).
- No prohibited letters (C, R, E) appear.
Thus it’s a good next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from previous feedback:
- N is correct in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4, so it can be position 2 or 5.
- Letters C, R, E, L, O, G are not in the word.

We need a word with N fourth, include A in position 2 or 5, and avoid the excluded letters. 
The word **FAINT** fits:
- Pattern: F A I N T
- N is fourth.
- A is second (allowed).
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus FAINT is a valid next guess.
