### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that the letters S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position. For the next guess we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain S, L, A, or T.
- Contains an E somewhere other than the fifth slot.
- Introduces new letters to test possible candidates.

A good candidate is **CIDER** (C I D E R). It meets all constraints and places E in position 4, giving us more information about the location of E and the other letters.

We know from the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, C are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word and is correct at position 4.
- I, D, and R are in the word but are in the wrong positions from guess “CIDER”.
  * I cannot be in position 2.
  * D cannot be in position 3.
  * R cannot be in position 5.
We need a 5‑letter word with E at the fourth spot, containing I, D, R in other allowed spots, and a new fifth letter not yet ruled out.

The word **FRIED** fits:
- F 1, R 2, I 3, E 4, D 5
- R is not in position 5, I is not in position 2, D is not in position 3, and E is correctly placed at 4.
- All letters are allowed (F is new, others are confirmed present).

Thus FRIED is a logical next guess.
