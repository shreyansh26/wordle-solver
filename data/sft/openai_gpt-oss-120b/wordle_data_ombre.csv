### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have gathered the following constraints from previous feedback:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- Letters **C, A, N, U, T** are not in the word.
- Letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 → possible positions: 3 or 4.
- Letter **O** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
- We need two more letters (positions 1 and 2) that are not any of the excluded letters.

Looking for a common 5‑letter English word ending in **E** that contains both **R** and **O** respecting those positional restrictions. “SHORE” fits perfectly:
- S (pos1) – new letter, allowed.
