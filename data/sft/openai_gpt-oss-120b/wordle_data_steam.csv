# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus possible layouts are:

3. _ _ E A _

We must avoid letters already ruled out (C,R,N,P,L,D,B,T). Using only allowed letters, a common word that fits layout 3 is **SHEAF** (S‑H‑E‑A‑F), where E is in position 3 and A in position 4, both satisfying the constraints and using only letters not excluded.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed: S (✓) at 1, E (✓) at 3, A (✓) at 4.
- Letters C, R, N, P, L, D, B, H, F are not in the word (x).
- Letters A and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in earlier guesses, which matches their current placements.
- Letter T is in the word (‑ in BETTA) and cannot be in positions 3 or 4; it must be at position 2 or 5.
- The remaining unknown letter (the fifth distinct letter) has not been identified yet.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S _ E A _** with T occupying either the second or fifth slot.

A common English word that matches this pattern and introduces a new plausible letter is **STEAK** (S‑T‑E‑A‑K), where T is in position 2 and K fills the final unknown slot.

This guess will confirm both the placement of T and test the fifth letter.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

All other letters from previous guesses are eliminated: C, R, N, P, L, D.

We need a new word that includes A and E in allowed spots and introduces new, untested letters. A pattern that satisfies the constraints is **_ E _ _ A** (E in position 2, A in position 5). A common English word matching this pattern and using only uneliminated letters is **BETTA**.

- E cannot be in positions 2,4,5 → possible positions 1 or 3.

Thus possible layouts are:
1. A _ E _ _
2. E _ _ A _
3. _ _ E A _

We must avoid letters already ruled out (C,R,N,P,L,D,B,T). Using only allowed letters, a common word that fits layout 3 is **SHEAF** (S‑H‑E‑A‑F), where E is in position 3 and A in position 4, both satisfying the constraints and using only letters not excluded.

So we guess SHEAF.
