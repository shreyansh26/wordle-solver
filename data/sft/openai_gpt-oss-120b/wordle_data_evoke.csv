### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback so far:
- The only correct letter in position 5 is **E**.
- The letter **O** appears in the word at least twice. One O is confirmed at position 3 (green), and another O is somewhere else but not at position 2 (yellow on the second O).
- All letters marked “x” are not in the word: A, B, C, D, I, L, N, R, S, T, U, W, Z, plus the letters C,R,A,N,S,L,I,D,B,U,T,W,Z.

Thus the secret word is of the form ___OE with the second‑to‑last letter unknown, contains O at position 3 and at least one more O not in position 2, and ends with E.  
We still need more information, so we should make a guess that keeps the confirmed letters (E at 5, O at 3) and introduces new, allowed letters while also testing the location of the second O.  

A good candidate is **HOOVE** (H O O V E). It uses only letters that have not been ruled out, keeps the confirmed O at position 3, places an O at position 2 (to test whether another O can be there), and ends with the confirmed E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Only the last letter 'E' is correct; positions 1‑4 have letters that are not in the word.

So the secret word ends with **E** and contains none of those excluded letters in any position.

We need a new word that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Does not use any of the excluded letters.
3. Introduces new letters to narrow down the solution.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out) include: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word meeting these criteria is **BUTTE** (B U T T E). It uses only allowed letters and keeps the confirmed final **E**.
