### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, which cover common consonants and a vowel.

We know from the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is correct and in the third position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word must be of the form __A__ with an E somewhere in positions 1‑4 (but not 5). It must avoid C, R, N. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **BEAST**:
- B E A S T
- A is third (✓)
- E is second (‑), not fifth
- No C, R, or N present.
Thus we’ll guess “BEAST”.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 2 is E (E is correct there).
- Position 3 is A (A is correct there).
- T is in the word but not in position 5, so T can be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters C, R, N, B, S are not in the word.
- Positions 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not excluded.

Looking for a common English word matching the pattern _ E A _ _, with T in position 1 or 4 and no forbidden letters.  
“HEATH” fits perfectly:
- H (position 1) – allowed.
- E (position 2) – matches the known correct placement.
- A (position 3) – matches the known correct placement.
- T (position 4) – T is present and not in position 5.
- H (position 5) – allowed and not excluded.

Thus “HEATH” satisfies all known constraints.
