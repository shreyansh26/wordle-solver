### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A and N are each in the word but placed in wrong positions: A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Excludes C, R, E.
- Includes A and N, but not at the forbidden spots.
- Introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

""MANGO"" fits: it contains A (position 2) and N (position 3), both avoiding the prohibited spots, and adds new letters M, G, O for further information, while containing none of the eliminated letters.

Thus the next guess is MANGO.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- The secret word does **not** contain: C, R, E, M, G, O.
- Letter **A** is confirmed at position 2 (A✓ from “MANGO”).
- Letter **N** is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4. From the two clues, N must be at position 1 or position 5.
- The remaining three letters are still unknown and must avoid the eliminated set.

We need a guess that:
1. Places A correctly at the second slot.
2. Places N in a possible slot (choose one to test). Using N at position 1 lets us check that possibility while still keeping position 5 open for later.
3. Introduces three new letters that have not been tried yet, to gather more information.

A good candidate is **NAILS**:
- Structure: N A I L S → satisfies A at position 2 and puts N at position 1 (a valid candidate).
- New letters I, L, S have not been tested and are not among the eliminated letters.
- No prohibited letters appear.

- C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A and N are each in the word but placed in wrong positions: A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Excludes C, R, E.
- Includes A and N, but not at the forbidden spots.
- Introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

""MANGO"" fits: it contains A (position 2) and N (position 3), both avoiding the prohibited spots, and adds new letters M, G, O for further information, while containing none of the eliminated letters.

Thus the next guess is MANGO.

- Letter **A** is confirmed at position 2 (A✓ from “MANGO”).
- Letter **N** is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4. From the two clues, N must be at position 1 or position 5.
- The remaining three letters are still unknown and must avoid the eliminated set.

We need a guess that:
1. Places A correctly at the second slot.
2. Places N in a possible slot (choose one to test). Using N at position 1 lets us check that possibility while still keeping position 5 open for later.
3. Introduces three new letters that have not been tried yet, to gather more information.

A good candidate is **NAILS**:
- Structure: N A I L S → satisfies A at position 2 and puts N at position 1 (a valid candidate).
- New letters I, L, S have not been tested and are not among the eliminated letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
