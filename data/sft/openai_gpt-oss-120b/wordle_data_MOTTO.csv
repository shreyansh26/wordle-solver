### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 1 is M (✓ from ""MIGHT"").
- Letters I, G, H are not in the word.
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 5 (since T got “-” at position 5 in ""MIGHT"").
- Letters C, R, A, N, E have been ruled out.

So the secret word starts with M, contains a T somewhere in positions 2‑4, and must avoid the eliminated letters.  

We need a new guess that respects these constraints and introduces fresh letters to gather more info.  
A good candidate is **MULTS**:
- Keeps M as the first letter.
- Places T at position 4 (still allowed).
- Introduces U, L, and S, none of which have been tested yet.

This will tell us whether U, L, S are in the word and also confirm the position of T.
