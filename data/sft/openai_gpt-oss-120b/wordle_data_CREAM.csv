### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that will give useful information about vowels and common consonants. “SLATE” is a good starter because it contains two common consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E). This should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

We have feedback from the first guess SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word must contain A and E, placed elsewhere. We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Includes A and E.
2. Does NOT place A in the third slot.
3. Does NOT place E in the fifth slot.
4. Avoids letters S, L, T.

A good candidate is **AHEAD**:
- Contains A (positions 1 and 4) and E (position 3).
- No S, L, or T.
- Satisfies the position constraints from the feedback.

Thus we will guess AHEAD.

From the feedback:

- SLATE: S, L, T not in the word; A is in the word but not at position 3; E is in the word but not at position 5.
- AHEAD: H and D are not in the word; the first A is not at position 1 (so A is only at position 4); E is correct at position 3; A is correct at position 4.

Thus the secret word pattern is **_ _ E A _**.

Letters that cannot be used: S, L, T, H, D, and A cannot be in positions 1 or 2, nor can E be at position 5.

A common English word fitting the pattern and avoiding the forbidden letters is **CREAM** (C R E A M).

This guess will test three new letters (C, R, M) while keeping the known correct letters in place.
