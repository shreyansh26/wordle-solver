### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to make an initial guess for the secret 5‑letter word. Since I have no feedback yet, I’ll choose a common starter that contains a mix of frequent letters and varied positions to give me useful information for the next rounds. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these games because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) in different spots.

We know from the feedback that the secret word ends with N (position 4) and E (position 5). The letters C, R, and A are not present anywhere. So the pattern is ***NE. The next guess should keep N and E fixed and try new letters in the first three spots to gather more information. “STONE” fits the pattern (S‑T‑O‑N‑E) and introduces three fresh letters.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 3 is O (✓ from STONE).
- Position 4 is N (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, A, S, T are not in the word (x).
Thus the word is of the form __ONE, with the first two letters not among {C,R,A,S,T}. Viable common English words fitting this pattern and avoiding excluded letters include ""PHONE"" (P and H are still possible). This will test two new letters while keeping the confirmed O N E.
