### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Current known pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: unknown, but T is excluded (T got an x)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: V (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Letters known not to be in the word: C, R, N, G, L, D, H, K, T, plus any others marked x.

We need a common English word matching S _ A V E with the second letter not among excluded letters. The word **SUAVE** fits perfectly (S‑U‑A‑V‑E). The letter U has not been tested and is not excluded.

Thus the next guess should be ""suave"".
