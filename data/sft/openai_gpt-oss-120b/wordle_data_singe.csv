### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback: CRANE -> C x, R x, A x, N -, E ✓. This tells us:
- The secret word ends with E (E is correct in position 5).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (since N was guessed at position 4 and got a “-”).
- C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

We need a new five‑letter word that:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback: CRANE -> C x, R x, A x, N -, E ✓. This tells us:
- The secret word ends with E (E is correct in position 5).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (since N was guessed at position 4 and got a “-”).
- C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains N somewhere in positions 1‑3 (but not 4).
3. Does not contain C, R, or A.

A good candidate is **NOISE**:
- Ends with E.
- N is in position 1.
- Uses letters O, I, S that have not been ruled out.

Thus we can test more information with this guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From NOISE: O is not in the word; S is not in the word; I is in the word but not in position 3; N is again indicated as present but not in position 1 (so N cannot be in positions 1 or 4). Therefore N must be in position 2 or 3, and I must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

We need a word ending with E, containing N (in position 2 or 3) and I (in position 1, 2, or 4, but not 3), and avoiding the letters C, R, A, O, S.  

The word **UNTIE** satisfies all constraints:
- Position 1: U (allowed)
- Position 2: N (allowed, N not in 1 or 4)
- Position 3: T (allowed, not I)
- Position 4: I (allowed, I not in 3)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)

Thus ""UNTIE"" is a valid next guess.

We need a five‑letter word ending in E, with N in the third slot, I in slot 1 or 2, and using only allowed letters.  
The word **BINGE** fits perfectly:

Thus it satisfies all constraints and will give new information.

From the feedback:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- From BINGE: I is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 3, G is correct in position 4, and B is not in the word.
All earlier guesses eliminated letters C, R, A, O, S, U, T, B, and also confirmed N, I, G, E are present.
Thus the secret word must be of the form _ I N G E.
The only common English word matching this pattern with an unused first letter is **HINGE** (H has not been ruled out).
Therefore the next guess should be HINGE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
