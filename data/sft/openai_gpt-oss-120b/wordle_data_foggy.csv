### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ O _ _ _.

We have the following feedback:

- CRANE: all letters are absent.
- SOLID: O is correct in position 2; other letters absent.

- GOOFY: G is present but not in position 1 (‑), O correct in position 2 (✓), O present elsewhere (‑), F present elsewhere (‑), Y correct in position 5 (✓).
- BOOGY: B absent (x), O correct in position 2 (✓), O present elsewhere (‑), G correct in position 4 (✓), Y correct in position 5 (✓).

From this we know:
- Position 2 = O, Position 4 = G, Position 5 = Y.
- The word contains the letters F and another O (the second O is not in position 3).
- G is not in position 1 (but we now know it is in position 4).
- All letters C,R,A,N,E,S,L,I,D,M,U,T,H,F? (F is present) are ruled out except F and the needed second O.

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ O _ G Y**, includes an F, and has at least two O’s (the extra O can be counted by the simplified feedback rule) is **FOGGY** (F O G G Y).

Testing “FOGGY” against all prior feedback using the defined symbols:
- Compared with GOOFY → G(‑) O(✓) O(‑) F(‑) Y(✓) ✔
- Compared with BOOGY → B(x) O(✓) O(‑) G(✓) Y(✓) ✔
