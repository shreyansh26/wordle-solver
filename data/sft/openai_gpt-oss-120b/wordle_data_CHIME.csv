### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that the secret word starts with C and ends with E, and letters L, O, V, R, A, N are not present anywhere. So the pattern is C _ _ _ E with remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. We need a real English 5‑letter word fitting that pattern and avoiding the excluded letters. ""CUTIE"" (C‑U‑T‑I‑E) satisfies all constraints and is a common word, making it an informative next guess.
