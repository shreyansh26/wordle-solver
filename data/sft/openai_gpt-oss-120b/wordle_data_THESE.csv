### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess that is a common 5‑letter English word, so it can give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter in word‑guessing games because it contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know:
- Secret word ends with E (✓ at position5).
- Letters C,R,A,N,L,I,D are not in the word.
- Letter S is in the word but not in position1 (from SLIDE feedback “S(-)”). So S must be in positions 2,3, or 4.
We need a new 5‑letter word with E at the end, containing S in one of those middle positions, and avoiding the disallowed letters.

Possible candidate: **MOUSE** (M O U S E). It ends with E, places S at position4, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Thus the next guess will be MOUSE.

- Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, A, N, L, I, D, M, O, U.
- The letter S is present only at position 4 (already placed).
We need a word of the form ___SE with S in the fourth slot, using only letters that haven’t been excluded.  
A common word that fits is **THESE** (T H E S E):
