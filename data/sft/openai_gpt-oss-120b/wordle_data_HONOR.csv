### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does not contain S, L, A, T, E, C, D. The letters H, O, R are present but are in wrong positions from guess 2 (CHORD): H is not in position 2, O not in position 3, R not in position 4. We need a word that includes H, O, R, placed in positions other than those, and fills the remaining two slots with letters not yet eliminated. “MORPH” uses M, O, R, P, H – all allowed, and positions H (5), O (2), R (3) avoid the prohibited spots. Thus it’s a good next guess.

We have eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, D, M, P.
From previous feedback:
- O is correct at position 2.
- H, R are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in previous guesses:
  * H cannot be at position 5 (from MORPH) and is not at position 2.
  * R cannot be at position 3 (from MORPH) and is not at position 2.
Thus we need a word with pattern ? O ? ? ?, containing H and R in allowed spots, and using only letters not yet ruled out.  
A good candidate is **HONOR** (H O N O R):
- H at position 1 (allowed),
- O at position 2 (the known correct spot),
- R at position 5 (allowed; R isn’t in position 3),
- N is a new letter to test, and the second O tests whether the word contains more than one O.

This word respects all constraints and maximizes new information.
