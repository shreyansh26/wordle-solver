### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- All letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From ""MOUTH"": M, U, T, H are not in the word, while O is correct and in the right position (second slot).

Thus the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _. We need a five‑letter word with O in the second position and none of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, U, T, H). A good candidate is **FOLKS** (F‑O‑L‑K‑S), which satisfies all constraints and uses only unused letters.

We have the following feedback:
- Position 1: D is correct (✓)
- Position 2: O is correct (✓)
- Position 3: D appears in the word but not here (-)
- Position 4: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

Since there is a second D in the word and it cannot be at position 3, the only remaining slot is position 4. Thus the secret word pattern is:

1 D, 2 O, 3 ?, 4 D, 5 Y → D O _ D Y

All previously eliminated letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,U,T,H,F,L,K,S,G. The third letter must be a letter not yet ruled out. A common English word fitting D O _ D Y is **DOWDY** (means unfashionable). The third letter W has not been used and is allowed.

Therefore, the next guess should be DOWDY.
