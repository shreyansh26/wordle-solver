### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,H,S,F,L,U,P,V and any others marked x.
- Confirmed letters: O at position 4, T at position 5, I is in the word but not at position 2.
- The pattern is _ _ _ O T with I occupying position 1 or 3.
A common word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **IDIOT** (I at 1, D at 2, I at 3, O at 4, T at 5). All letters are permissible.
