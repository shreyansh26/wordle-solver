### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:
- From SLATE: S, L, A are not in the word; T and E are in the word but not in positions 4 (T) and 5 (E) respectively.
- From METRO: M, R, O are not in the word; T is correct at position 3; E is in the word but not at position 2.

Thus:
- T is definitely at position 3.
- E is in the word, cannot be at positions 2, 5, or 4 (from SLATE it’s not at 5, from METRO it’s not at 2). So E can be at position 1 or 4.
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, M, R, O.

We need a 5‑letter word with T in the third slot and E in either the first or fourth slot, using none of the excluded letters.

A good candidate is **CITED**:
- Pattern C I T E D matches T at position 3 and E at position 4.
- Letters C, I, D are not among the excluded set.

Thus we will guess “CITED”.
