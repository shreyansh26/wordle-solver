### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess CRANE:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain R and E, with R not in the second slot and E not in the fifth slot. It must not contain C, A, or N.

Choose a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the excluded letters. “SURER” fits:
- Contains R (positions 3 and 5) – neither is position 2.
- Contains E (position 4) – not position 5.
- Uses only letters S, U, R, E, all allowed.

Thus “SURER” is a good next guess.
