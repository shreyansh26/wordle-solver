### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first letter is C and the other letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all. So the secret pattern is C _ _ _ _. I need a new guess that keeps C in position 1 and uses fresh letters that haven't been ruled out. Choosing common letters like L, O, U, T gives good coverage and avoids the excluded letters.

We have C correct in position 1. L, O, U are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed: L not position 2, O not position 3, U not position 4. T, R, A, N, E are not in the word. We need a new word that keeps C in the first slot, places L, O, U in other allowed slots, and adds a new candidate letter for the remaining position. The word “COULD” satisfies all constraints:
- C in position 1 (fixed)
- O in position 2 (O was not allowed in position 3, so position 2 is fine)
- U in position 3 (U was not allowed in position 4, so position 3 is fine)
- L in position 4 (L was not allowed in position 2, so position 4 is fine)
- D in position 5 introduces a new letter not yet ruled out.
Thus “COULD” is a valid next guess.
