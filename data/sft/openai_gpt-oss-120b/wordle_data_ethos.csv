# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- L, A, E are NOT in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters S and T (in other positions) and cannot contain L, A, or E. We should pick a new guess that includes S and T in different spots and also introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

The word **CRUST** fits:
- Contains S (position 4) and T (position 5), satisfying the “wrong‑position” clues.
- Uses new letters C, R, U that we haven’t tested yet.
- Contains no L, A, or E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- L, A, E are NOT in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters S and T (in other positions) and cannot contain L, A, or E. We should pick a new guess that includes S and T in different spots and also introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

The word **CRUST** fits:
- Contains S (position 4) and T (position 5), satisfying the “wrong‑position” clues.
- Uses new letters C, R, U that we haven’t tested yet.
- Contains no L, A, or E.

So we’ll guess CRUST.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- S is confirmed at position 5 (from TOMBS).
- T is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5, so it must be in position 2 or 3.
- Excluded letters: L, A, E, C, R, U, O, M, B, plus any others revealed as “x”.
Thus remaining possible letters are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in S, containing T at position 2 or 3, and using only allowed letters. A suitable candidate is **KITTS** (K I T T S): it ends with S, places T at position 3 (allowed), and all its letters are from the allowed set.

This guess will test new letters K and I while respecting all constraints.
