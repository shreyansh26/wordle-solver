### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is correct in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word must be of the form **C _ _ N _**, must contain the letter **A** somewhere other than position 3, and must not contain **R** or **E**.

A good next guess keeps C and N in their known spots, places A in a new position (position 2 or 5), and introduces new letters to test. The word **CAINS** fits these requirements:
- C in position 1, A in position 2 (different from the previous guess), N in position 4.
- Uses new letters I and S for further testing.
- Contains no prohibited letters R or E.

Thus the next guess is “CAINS”.

We have the following feedback:
- Position 1: C is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is in the word but not here (-) → A must be elsewhere.
- Position 3: I is correct (✓)
- Position 4: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: S is not in the word (x)

Since A cannot be in position 2 and the only remaining empty slots are positions 2 and 5, A must be in position 5.  
Thus the word pattern is C _ I N A.  

We need a common English 5‑letter word fitting that pattern and not using any excluded letters (R, E, S). The word **CHINA** matches perfectly (C H I N A).  

Now we guess that word.
