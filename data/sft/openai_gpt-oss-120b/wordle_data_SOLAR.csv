### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give useful information for subsequent guesses.  
A good opening guess is **CRANE** – it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and both a vowel (A, E) and a frequently used letter (R). This should reveal a lot about the secret word's composition and letter positions.

We know from previous feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes R and A in different positions, avoids C, N, E, and tests new letters.  
“TORAH” satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R (position 3) – not position 2.
- Contains A (position 4) – not position 3.
- Uses only new letters T, O, H besides R and A.
Thus it will give us more information without violating known exclusions.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 is O (from TORAH feedback ✅).
- Position 4 is A (from TORAH feedback ✅).
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3; therefore it can be in position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, T, H, plus letters marked x in guesses (C, N, E, T, H, plus T, H, etc.)

We need a word matching pattern _ O _ A _. Possible candidates include ""MOLAR"" (M O L A R) and ""SOLAR"" (S O L A R). Both fit the known constraints and avoid excluded letters. Either will give more information about the remaining unknown letters and the exact position of R.

I'll choose ""SOLAR"" as the next guess.
