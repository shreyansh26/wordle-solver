From the first guess ""CRANE"", we learned:
- Position 2 is R (✓)
- Position 3 is A (✓)
- Position 5 is E (✓)
- Letters C and N are not in the word at all.
So the secret word fits the pattern _ R A _ E, with the first and fourth letters still unknown and cannot be C or N.

To test new possibilities for those two positions, I’ll guess a word that keeps R, A, E fixed and introduces two fresh letters. ""GRAPE"" fits the pattern (G at position 1, P at position 4) and uses no prohibited letters.

We have determined the secret word pattern is B R A _ E, with letters B, R, A, and E confirmed in positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 respectively. Position 4 cannot be V (from BRAVE) and cannot be any letters previously ruled out: C, N, G, P, T, D, V. The remaining common letter that fits is K, forming the word ""BRAKE"". This word uses only letters not yet eliminated, so it is a logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

So the secret word fits the pattern _ R A _ E, with the first and fourth letters still unknown and cannot be C or N.
