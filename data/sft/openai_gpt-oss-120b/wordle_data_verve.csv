### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that only the last letter E is correct and in the right place, and the letters S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- The secret word ends with **V E** (positions 4 and 5 are V and E).
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters **S, L, A, T, G, O** are not present anywhere.
- No other letters are ruled out yet.

A word that satisfies all these conditions is **NERVE**:
- Pattern: N E R V E → V is in position 4, E in position 5.
- R is in position 3 (not position 2), satisfying the “‑” feedback.
- None of the forbidden letters appear.

Thus, NERVE is a valid next guess.
