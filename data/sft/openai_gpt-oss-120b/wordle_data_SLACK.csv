### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Secret word is 5 letters.
- From guess CRANE: C is in the word but not in position 1, R, N, E are not in the word, A is correct in position 3.
Thus pattern: _ _ A _ _. Must contain C somewhere other than position 1. No R, N, E.

Choose a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters. ""FLACK"" fits:
- A is at position 3.
- Contains C at position 4 (not position 1).
- Uses letters F, L, K which we haven't tested yet.
- Does not include R, N, or E.

So FLACK is a valid next guess.
