### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular first guess in this type of game because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two common consonants and three frequent letters, including a vowel in the middle. This should give me a good spread of feedback to narrow down the possibilities.

We know from the feedback that:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, and E are NOT in the word at all.

We need a new guess that includes C somewhere other than the first position, and avoids the disallowed letters. Choosing a word with several new letters will give us more information. “MUSIC” places C at the last position and introduces M, U, S, I, all still possible. It also respects the constraints (no R, A, N, E).
