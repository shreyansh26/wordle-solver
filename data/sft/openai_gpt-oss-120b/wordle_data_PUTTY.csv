### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter because it includes the common vowel “A” and “E” and frequent consonants “C”, “R”, “N”. I will submit that as my first guess.

Thus T must be in positions 1‑4.

Choosing a common word with T in position 2 works well: **STOMP** (S‑T‑O‑M‑P). None of its letters have been eliminated, and T is not in the fifth slot.

This will give us information about the presence/position of S, O, M, and P, and confirm T’s exact location.
