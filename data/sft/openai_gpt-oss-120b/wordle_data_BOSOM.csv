### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a first guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N). I'll use that as my first guess.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, U, L are not in the secret word.
- Letter O is present and correctly placed at position 2.
- Letter S is present and, after eliminating positions 1, 4, and 5, must be at position 3.

Thus the pattern is: _ O S _ _.

We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern using only letters not eliminated.  
Possible letters for the remaining spots are: B, D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O and S already placed).

The word **BOSKY** (B O S K Y) matches the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and is a valid English word.

Therefore the next guess is BOSKY.

We have determined the secret word pattern is B O S _ _. All letters B, O, S are confirmed in correct positions. Letters K and Y are not in the word, and many other letters are excluded from earlier guesses. Remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5 are among D, F, I, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. A common English word that fits the pattern B O S _ _ is **BOSOM** (B O S O M), using O again (allowed) and M, which hasn't been ruled out. This guess will test whether O appears a second time and introduce M.
