### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains the letters **C** and **N**, placed in different positions from those tested. The remaining three letters are still unknown but cannot be R, A, or E.

I need a new guess that:
1. Keeps C and N (to confirm their new positions).
2. Moves C and N to positions not previously tried.
3. Introduces three fresh letters to gather more info.

Word **LUNCH** fits:
- Contains C (now at position 4) and N (position 3), both different from prior spots.
- Adds new letters L, U, H for further testing.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Thus I will guess **LUNCH**.

We have determined the exact letters and positions for three of the five slots:

- Position 3: N (✓ from LUNCH)
- Position 4: C (✓ from LUNCH)
- Position 5: H (✓ from LUNCH)

The first two positions are still unknown. From previous feedback, we know the letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, E, L, U, and also the letters already placed (N, C, H). Therefore we need a word of the form __NCH using letters that haven’t been eliminated.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **FINCH** (F‑I‑N‑C‑H). Neither F nor I has been ruled out, and the word satisfies the known positions for N, C, H.

Thus the next logical guess is FINCH.
