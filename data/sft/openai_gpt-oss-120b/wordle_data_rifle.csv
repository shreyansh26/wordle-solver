### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Position 5 is definitely **E** (correct from both guesses).
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters **C, A, N, S, H, O** are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that ends with **E**, contains **R** (in position 1 or 3), and avoids the excluded letters.  

A suitable candidate is **PURGE**:

From previous feedback:

- Letters C, A, N, S, H, O, P, U, G are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is **R _ _ _ E**, using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. A common word fitting this pattern and using allowed letters is **RIFLE** (R‑I‑F‑L‑E).
