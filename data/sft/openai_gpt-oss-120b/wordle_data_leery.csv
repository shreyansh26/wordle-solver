### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess that contains a mix of common letters and varied positions to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a popular starter word because it includes a common vowel (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N). This should give a good spread of information for the next steps.

We have these constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, O, S, B.
- Known present letters: E, R, Y, L.
- Position 2 is fixed as **E** (E was correct in guess 3).
- R is **not** in positions 1, 2, or 3 → R can be in 4 or 5.
- Y is **not** in position 4 → Y can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- L is **not** in positions 3 or 5 → L can be in 1 or 4.

A layout that satisfies all these limits is:
1 = L, 2 = E, 3 = E, 4 = R, 5 = Y → the word **LEERY**.

“LEERY” uses only the allowed letters, places each known letter in an allowed spot, and introduces a repeated E (which hasn’t been ruled out). It also adds no forbidden letters, giving useful new information.

So the next guess is:
