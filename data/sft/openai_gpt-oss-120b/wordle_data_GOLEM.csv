### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is present but cannot be in the 5th position (since it was “-” in CRANE). So the new guess must contain E in positions 1‑4 and avoid C, R, A, N. Choosing a common word with those constraints helps narrow possibilities. ""MOTEL"" fits: it uses letters M, O, T, E, L (none are excluded) and places E in the 4th slot, giving us new information about its correct position.

The secret word must have O in the second position and E in the fourth position. All letters that received an “x” feedback are not in the word: C, R, A, N, M, T, L, J, K, D, B, S.  
Remaining possible letters are: F, G, H, I, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (besides the known O and E).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ O _ E _. We need a common English word that uses O in the second slot and E in the fourth slot, avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible candidates: “JOKED” (J O K E D) meets all constraints:

- No prohibited letters appear.

So “JOKED” is a valid next guess.
