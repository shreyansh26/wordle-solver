### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE, the feedback tells me:
- C, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4, so N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

I need a word with R as the second letter and N somewhere other than position 4.  
The word **BROWN** fits:
- Pattern _ R _ _ N (R in position 2, N in position 5).
- Contains none of the excluded letters C, A, or E.
Thus it will test new letters B, O, and W while respecting the known constraints.
