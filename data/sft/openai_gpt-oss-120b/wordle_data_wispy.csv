### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, F are not in the secret word (x).
- Letter I is in the word but not in position 4 (since MOTIF gave “-” for I in position 4).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains I in a different position (1,2,3, or 5).
2. Avoids all eliminated letters.

Choosing “SPILL” gives letters S, P, I, L, L. None of S, P, L are among the eliminated letters, and I is placed at position 3, satisfying the requirement that it isn’t in position 4.

Thus “SPILL” is a valid next guess.

- Contains I, P, S.
- Positions: I is at 2 (allowed), P at 3 (allowed), S at 4 (allowed), satisfying all “‑” constraints.

Thus “GIPSY” is a valid next guess.

From previous feedback we have:
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,F,L,G.
- I is correct at position 2 (✓ from GIPSY).
- Y is correct at position 5 (✓ from GIPSY).
- P is in the word but not at position 3 (‑ from GIPSY), and also not at position 2 (from SPILL). So P can be at position 1 or 4.
- S is in the word but not at position 1 (‑ from SPILL) nor position 4 (‑ from GIPSY). Thus S must be at position 3.
Putting this together, the pattern is: _ I S _ Y. The only remaining slot for P is position 4, giving _ I S P Y. A common English word matching this pattern and using only allowed letters is **WISPY**.
