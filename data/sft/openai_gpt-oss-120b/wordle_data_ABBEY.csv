# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or N. It does contain A and E, but not in the positions they appeared in CRANE (A not 3rd, E not 5th). So we need a new word that includes A and E in different slots, while avoiding C,R,N. A good candidate is ""MALES"": it places A in the 2nd slot and E in the 4th slot, both different from the previous positions, and adds new letters M, L, S for further clues.

We have the following information:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, M, L, S.
- Letter E is correct at position 5.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and MALES). So A can be at position 1 or 4.
Thus the pattern is either A _ _ _ E or _ _ _ A E.

We need a word that fits the pattern and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “ABIDE” matches the pattern A _ _ _ E, uses new letters B, I, D (none are excluded), and places A in position 1, which is allowed.

Therefore the next guess will be “ABIDE”.

Thus the secret word starts with **AB**, contains **E** somewhere other than the 5th slot (so position 3 or 4), and cannot contain any of the letters already ruled out: C, R, N, M, L, S, I, D.
