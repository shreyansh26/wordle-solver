### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (it was last in CRANE).

Thus the next guess must include E in a different spot and avoid C, R, A, N. Choose a common word with E elsewhere, such as ""SHELF"" (E is the third letter). This word uses only new letters S, H, L, F plus E, satisfying the constraints.

We have the following information from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, H, L, F are NOT in the secret word.
- The letter E is in the word and is confirmed to be in position 3 (from the feedback on SHELF).
Thus the secret word has the form __E__ with E fixed in the middle, and the remaining four letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.

Choosing a word that contains only allowed letters will give us the most useful new information. “TWEET” fits the pattern:
- It places E in the required third position.
- It uses only the letters T, W, and another E, none of which have been eliminated.
- It also tests whether the secret word contains a second E and whether T appears in the word.

Therefore, the next guess is “TWEET”.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N are not in the word; E is in the word but not position 5.
- From guess 2 (SHELF): S,H,L,F are not in the word; E is correct at position 3.
- From guess 3 (TWEET): T is correct at position 1, W at position 2, E at positions 3 and 4, and the second T (position 5) is not in the word.

Thus the secret word is of the form **T W E E _**, with the final letter unknown and not among the eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,S,H,L,F). A common English word matching this pattern is **TWEED**.
