### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I’ll start with a common opening word that contains a mix of frequent letters and varied positions to gather useful information. “CRANE” is a popular starter in many 5‑letter word games because it tests C, R, A, N, and E.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, and E are not in the word at all.
- A and N are in the word but are in the wrong positions (A is not position 3, N is not position 4).

The next guess must therefore contain A and N in different positions, avoid C, R, and E, and fill the remaining spots with other common letters.

“MANGO” satisfies these conditions:
- Contains A (position 2, not the original position 3)
- Contains N (position 3, not the original position 4)
- Uses only new letters (M, G, O) that haven’t been ruled out.
Thus it is a good candidate for the second guess.
