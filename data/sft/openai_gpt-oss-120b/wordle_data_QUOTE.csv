### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it contains the frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. This should provide a solid baseline for the next steps.

We know the secret word ends with **E** (position 5).  
From ""VOGUE"": O and U are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (O not in position 2, U not in position 4).

We need a five‑letter word ending in **E** that includes O and U in new positions while keeping the known correct placement of **E**.  
The word **OVULE** fits:

- The other letters (V, L) are already known to be absent, but they can be included to test positions without breaking any constraints.

We have:
- Position 5 is confirmed E.
- O is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → O can be 3 or 4.
- U is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 → U can be 1 or 2.
Thus a viable pattern is _ U O _ E (U at 2, O at 3). The word **QUOTE** fits this pattern:
- Q (unused), U (position 2), O (position 3), T (unused), E (position 5).
All other letters (C,R,A,N,S,L,I,D,V,G) are still excluded, and Q and T have not been ruled out. Therefore QUOTE is an optimal next guess.
