### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since I have no clues yet, I'll choose a common 5‑letter word that includes a mix of frequent letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This will give useful information about the secret word's letters and positions.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 5 is definitely E (✓ from both guesses).
- The letter A is in the word but not in position 2 (from guess 2) nor position 3 (from guess 1). So A can be in position 1 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, P, S, T (all marked x).
Thus we need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing A in position 1 or 4, and using none of the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- AGILE (A‑G‑I‑L‑E) → A at position 1, all other letters are allowed.
- ABIDE (A‑B‑I‑D‑E) → also fits.

- Position 1 = A (confirmed ✓).
- Position 5 = E (confirmed ✓).
- Letters C, R, N, P, S, T, G, I, L are all ruled out (marked x in some position).
- The letter A is only correct at position 1 (previous guesses showed A in other spots as “-”).

We need a word of the form A _ _ _ E using only allowed letters (excluding the ruled‑out set).  
“ABOVE” fits: A (pos1) ✓, B, O, V are not excluded, and E (pos5) ✓.

Thus the next guess will be **ABOVE**.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: B (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Only position 4 remains unknown. The guess “ABOVE” gave V as wrong, so the fourth letter cannot be V. The only common English word fitting the pattern A B O _ E is “ABODE” with D in the fourth position. D has not been ruled out by any prior feedback, so it’s a valid candidate.

Thus the next guess should be ABODE.
