### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain both N and E in different positions, while avoiding C, R, and A. I’ll choose a word that includes N and E in new positions and introduces other common letters to gather more information. “LENDS” fits: L E N D S has E at position 2 and N at position 3 (both allowed), and none of the excluded letters appear.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A are not in the word; N is present but not in position 4; E is present but not in position 5.
- From LENDS: L is present but not in position 1; E is correct at position 2; N is present but not in position 3; D and S are not in the word.

So far:
- Position 2 = **E** (fixed).
- The word must contain **N** (cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and cannot be in position 2). Therefore N can be in position 1 or 5.
- The word must contain **L** (cannot be in position 1). Thus L can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, D, S.

A common 5‑letter word that satisfies all these constraints is **MELON**:
- Pattern M E L O N fits the known positions.
- It contains N at position 5 (allowed) and L at position 3 (allowed).
- No excluded letters appear.

Thus “MELON” is a logical next guess.
