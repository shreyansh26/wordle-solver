### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common, information‑rich five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. A good first guess is **CRANE**, which includes the vowels A and E and the frequent consonants C, R, and N. This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word, and the last letter is E (✓). Therefore the next guess must end with E and avoid using C, R, A, N. A good candidate is ""GLIDE"", which uses new letters G, L, I, D and ends with E. This will test four new letters while respecting the constraints.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 5 is **E** (✓ on both guesses).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, D** are not in the word (all marked x).
- Letters **G, L, I** are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
  * G was guessed at position 1 → G cannot be position 1.
  * L was guessed at position 2 → L cannot be position 2.
  * I was guessed at position 3 → I cannot be position 3.

So the secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, contain G, L, I, and not contain any of the excluded letters.  
A word that satisfies all these conditions is **LIEGE**:

- L I E G E
- L is in position 1 (not position 2) → satisfies the L‑constraint.
- I is in position 2 (not position 3) → satisfies the I‑constraint.
- G is in position 4 (not position 1) → satisfies the G‑constraint.
- Ends with E as required.
- Uses no excluded letters.

Thus “LIEGE” is a valid next guess that tests the remaining possibilities while respecting all known constraints.
