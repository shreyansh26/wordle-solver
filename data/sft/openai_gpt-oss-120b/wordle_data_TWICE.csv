### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters S, L, R, A, N are not in the word (x)
- C was present but not in position 1, now correctly placed at 4.

So the word looks like __ICE. Viable English words fitting this pattern and not using excluded letters are limited. “VOICE” (V O I C E) matches the pattern, introduces new letters V and O that haven’t been ruled out, and is a common word. Hence the next guess should be VOICE.

We have determined the word pattern is __ICE (positions 3 = I, 4 = C, 5 = E). Excluded letters from previous guesses are: R, A, N, S, L, V, O, J, U. Remaining possible letters for the first two positions include many, but common English words fitting __ICE are limited. ""TWICE"" (T,W,I,C,E) uses letters not yet excluded and is a valid common word. This guess will either solve the puzzle or further narrow it down.
