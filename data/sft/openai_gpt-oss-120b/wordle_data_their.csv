### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new guess respecting known constraints: R is definitely at position 5, and E is in the word but not at position 5 (from guess 1) nor at position 4 (from guess 2). To test the location of E further and introduce fresh letters, I’ll guess a word that places E at position 1 and also includes E at position 4 (to see if that slot is indeed wrong). “ELDER” fits the pattern, uses allowed letters, and ends with R.

- Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, O, V, L, D (from previous “x” feedback).
- We must avoid putting **R** in positions 1‑4 (it’s only confirmed at 5).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep **R** at the end.
2. Place **E** at position 3 (testing that possibility) while also allowing a second **E** at position 4 (which we know is wrong) to see how the system marks it.
3. Introduce new letters not yet ruled out.

We have the following confirmed placements from feedback:
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

Letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, O, V, L, D, S (all marked x).  
E cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (both marked -), so E is only at position 3.  
R is only at position 5 (the R in position 1 of “ROVER” was marked -).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern ? H E ? R.

We need a valid English word matching ""?HE?R"" using only letters not eliminated.  
“Their” (THEIR) matches this pattern: T H E I R, with new letters T and I that have not been ruled out.

Therefore the next logical guess is **THEIR**.
