### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information for the next guesses. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in these games because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know from the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with **C**. It must contain **R** and **A** elsewhere, with R not in the second slot and A not in the third slot. We also must avoid N and E.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **CARDS**:
- C in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (allowed, A isn’t restricted from slot 2)
- R in position 3 (allowed, R isn’t restricted from slot 3)
- D and S are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Thus, “CARDS” satisfies all known information and introduces two new letters for more insight.

We have:
- C is correct at position 1.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → must be position 4 or 5.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → must be position 4 or 5.
- The remaining two positions (2 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not N, E, D, S and have not been tried yet.

A common word that satisfies these constraints is **CIGAR**:
- C ✓ (position 1)
- I ? (new test letter)
- G ? (new test letter)
- A – (A is present but not at position 4, consistent with the “‑” feedback)
- R – (R is present but not at position 5, consistent with the “‑” feedback)

Thus CIGAR fits all known information and introduces two fresh letters (I, G) for further clues.
