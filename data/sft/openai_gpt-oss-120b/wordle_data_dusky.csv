### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:

- From the first guess, S is in the word but not in position 1.
- From the second guess, S is still present but not in position 4. So S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- From the third guess (MUSKY), we learned:
  * M is not in the word.
  * U is correct in position 2.
  * S is correct in position 3.
  * K is correct in position 4.
  * Y is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ U S K Y**.  
The first letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, M) and also cannot be S (since S is already fixed at position 3). The only common English word that matches `_USKY` is **HUSKY**, with H as the first letter, which has not been ruled out.

Therefore the next logical guess is **HUSKY**.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ U S K Y, with the first letter still unknown. The letters that cannot be the first letter are those already eliminated: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, M, H. The common English word that fits the pattern is ""DUSKY"" (meaning somewhat dark). The letter D has not been ruled out yet, so it is a valid guess.
