### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a reasonable common five‑letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, giving me good information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C or E. It does contain R, A, and N, but each of those letters is in the wrong position relative to the guess ""crane"": 
- R cannot be in position 2,
- A cannot be in position 3,
- N cannot be in position 4.

Thus we need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, N, excludes C and E, and places R, A, N in positions other than those prohibited. A good candidate is **ADORN**:
- A is in position 1 (allowed),
- R is in position 4 (allowed, not position 2),
- N is in position 5 (allowed, not position 4),
- It contains no C or E.

So the next guess will be ""adorn"".

- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
- D cannot be in position 2.
