### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the Wordle-like game with an initial guess. A good opening word uses common letters and varied positions. I'll choose ""CRANE"", which contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We have pattern from feedback: C (correct at position 1), R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word. So the secret word is C _ A N _.
