- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have gathered feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, L, I.
- R is in the word but cannot be at positions 1,2,4,5 → must be at position 3.
- O is in the word; we know O is correct at position 4 and cannot be at position 2.
- T is in the word but not at positions 3 or 5 (and also not at 5 from earlier guess).
Thus the pattern is:
1 ? , 2 ?, 3 R, 4 O, 5 ?
T must occupy either position 1 or 2.  
A common English word fitting these constraints is **THROW** (T H R O W):

- No forbidden letters appear.

We have the following confirmed positions from the feedback:

- Position 1: T (✓ from THROW)
- Position 2: H (✓ from THROW)
- Position 3: R (✓ from THROW)
- Position 4: O (✓ from THROW)

Position 5 is still unknown. Letters known not to be in the word are: C, A, N, E, S, L, I, W, and also any letters that received an “x” in earlier guesses (e.g., from CRANE and SLIRT). The only remaining common letters that could complete a valid English word in the pattern **THRO_** are limited. The most common and sensible completion is **B**, forming the word **THROB**, which is a valid 5‑letter English word and does not use any excluded letters.

Thus the next guess should be THROB.
