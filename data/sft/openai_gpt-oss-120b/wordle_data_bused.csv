### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have deduced the secret word must be B _ _ E D based on earlier feedback (B✓, E✓, D✓). The fourth guess “usedb” received a “-” for every letter, meaning each guessed letter is in the word but in a different position. That fits the word **BUSED**, where:

- B is at position 1 (not position 5)
- U is at position 2 (not position 1)
- S is at position 3 (not position 2)
- E is at position 4 (not position 3)
- D is at position 5 (not position 4)

All prior feedback is consistent with “bused”. Therefore the correct next guess is the word “bused”.
