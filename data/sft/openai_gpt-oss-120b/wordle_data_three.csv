### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us:

- R is in the word but not in the second position.

So the secret word has the form _ _ _ _ E, includes an R somewhere other than position 2, and does not contain C, A, or N. I’ll choose a common word that meets these constraints: **SPORE** (S‑P‑O‑R‑E). It ends with E, has R in the fourth position, and avoids the excluded letters.

We have the constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (from both prior guesses).
- Letters C, A, N, S, P, O are not in the word.
We need a guess that places R in a new possible position (1 or 3) and introduces new letters to test.
A good candidate is **RHYME**:
- R is placed at position 1 (allowed).
- Introduces H, Y, M which have not been tested.
- Keeps E at position 5.
