### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:

So the secret word must contain R and E in different positions than those guessed.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, A, N, O, V are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 4.
- R is correct at position 5, and also known to be in the word (so the R at position5 satisfies that).
Thus the secret word pattern is ___ER, with the first three letters unknown but cannot include C, A, N, O, V, and should avoid placing R elsewhere unless the word has two Rs (unlikely).

We need a word that fits ___ER and introduces new letters to test. “TIMER” fits the pattern (T I M E R), uses new letters T, I, M, and respects all exclusions.

We have determined the secret word ends with **E** in position 4 and **R** in position 5. All other letters tried (C, A, N, O, V, T, I, M, S, U, P) are not in the word. The remaining possible letters for positions 1‑3 are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, R (only possibly in position 3), W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word that fits the pattern ___ER using only allowed letters is **FLYER** (F‑L‑Y‑E‑R). It respects all known constraints and introduces three new letters to test.

Thus the next guess is:
