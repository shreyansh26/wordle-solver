### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback from first guess:
- S is not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E**. It contains **L** and **A** somewhere in positions 1‑4, but L cannot be slot 2 and A cannot be slot 3. We need a new word fitting that pattern, using fresh letters to gather more info while respecting the exclusions.

Word “AMPLE” matches:
- Pattern _ _ _ _ E.

- No forbidden letters S or T.
- Introduces new letters M and P for additional clues.
