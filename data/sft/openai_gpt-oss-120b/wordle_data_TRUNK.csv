### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from feedback that R is correct at position 2 and N is correct at position 4. Letters C, A, and E are not in the word at all. So the secret word has pattern _ R _ N _. We need a common 5‑letter word fitting that pattern without using C, A, or E.

Possible candidates: FRONT, DRINK, BRING, TRUNK, GRIND, etc. All satisfy the pattern and avoid the excluded letters. I’ll pick “FRONT” as the next guess.

We have confirmed letters:
- R in position 2 (✓)
- N in position 4 (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (from FRONT feedback), so T must be in position 1 or 3.
Letters not in the word: C, A, E, F, O.

Trying a word with pattern ?R?N? that includes T in position 1 or 3 and avoids the excluded letters.  
""TRUNK"" fits: T at position 1, R at 2, U at 3, N at 4, K at 5. No forbidden letters appear.
Thus the next guess should be TRUNK.
