### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful information. “SLATE” includes two common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (S, L, T), making it a solid first guess.

We know from the first feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- L, T, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret pattern is S _ _ _ _.  
A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
We should pick a word with S at the start, include A elsewhere (not position 3), and avoid L, T, E.

A good candidate is **SUGAR**:
- S is already correct at position 1.
- A appears at position 4 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters (L, T, E) are present.
- Introduces new letters U, G, R for further clues.

Thus the next guess is SUGAR.
