### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word starts with **S K I** from previous feedback. The fourth and fifth letters are not **L** (both marked x) and cannot be any of the letters already eliminated: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, P, R, T, U, and also not L. The remaining possible letters are B, D, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly repeats of S, K, I). 

We need a valid English word of the form **SKI??** that uses only allowable letters. “SKIFF” (S K I F F) fits this pattern, introduces the new letter **F** (which we haven’t tested yet) and repeats it in the last two positions, giving us clear information about both places.

Therefore the next guess should be **SKIFF**.
