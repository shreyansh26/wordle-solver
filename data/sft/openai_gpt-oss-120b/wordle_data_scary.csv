### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants, giving me useful information for the next steps. “CRANE” is a good starter: it includes the vowel A and the common letters C, R, N, E. I’ll submit that as my first guess.

We know:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- C is in the word but not at position 1.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- N and E are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ A _ _ that contains C and R (with the above position restrictions) and avoids N and E. “SCARF” fits perfectly:
- S (pos1) – ok.
- C (pos2) – C is not at pos1, satisfies the “-” clue.
- A (pos3) – matches the ✓.
- R (pos4) – R is not at pos2, satisfies the “-” clue.
- F (pos5) – not N or E.

Thus SCARF is a valid next guess.

The feedback tells us that the first four letters are correct: S in position 1, C in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4. The fifth letter is not F, and from earlier guesses we also know N, E, and F are not in the word. A common English word that fits the pattern S C A R _ is “SCARY”, with Y as the final letter, which hasn't been ruled out. This will test the last letter.
