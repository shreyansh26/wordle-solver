### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified that the secret word contains letters C, A, and L, and we know their position constraints:
- C cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → C must be in position 4 or 5.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → A must be in position 2 or 5.
- L cannot be in position 5 → L must be in positions 1‑4.

All other letters tried (R, N, E, I, D, S, F, O) are not in the word.

Choosing C at position 4 and A at position 2 satisfies all constraints, and we can place L at position 1. Filling the remaining slots with new, allowed letters (T, H) gives the valid English word **LATCH**.

Thus the next guess should be “LATCH”.
