### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct in position 1). R, A, and E are not in the word at all. N is in the word but not in position 4, so N must be in position 2, 3, or 5. We need a new 5‑letter word starting with C, containing N in one of those allowed spots, and avoiding R, A, E. “CYNIC” fits: C Y N I C – it starts with C, has N in position 3 (allowed), and contains no R, A, or E.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1 is C.
- Position 3 is N.
- Letter I is in the word but not at position 4.
- There is a second C in the word, but not at position 5.
- Y, R, A, E are not in the word.

A likely arrangement is C I N C _ (with I at position 2 and the second C at position 4). The word “CINCH” fits this pattern and introduces a new fifth letter (H) to test.

Thus the next guess should be “CINCH”.
