### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, N) and three common vowels (A, E) plus an R. This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the first guess that:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- N is correct and in the fourth position.

Thus the secret word has the form _ _ _ N _. We need a word with N as the fourth letter and none of the excluded letters. “MOUNT” fits this pattern (M O U N T) and uses only new letters, so it will give us useful new information.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:
- Position 2 is **O** (from MOUNT).
- Position 4 is **N** (from CRANE and MOUNT).
- Position 5 is **T** (from MOUNT).
- Letters C, R, A, E, M, U are not in the word.
Thus the pattern is: _ O _ N T.

Possible common words fitting this pattern include **POINT** and **JOINT**. Both satisfy the known letters and avoid excluded letters. Choosing one will test the first letter.

I will guess **POINT** to see if the first letter is P or something else.
