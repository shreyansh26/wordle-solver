### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" includes two common consonants (C,R,N) and two vowels (A,E), giving a good chance to identify any correct letters or positions early on.

From the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

I need a new five‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions from those ruled out, and avoids C, A, N. “RELIT” satisfies these conditions: R at position 1 (allowed), E at position 2 (allowed), and the other letters L, I, T are unused so far.

We know:
- Position 2 is E (✓ from RELIT).
- Position 5 is T (✓ from RELIT).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters C, A, N, L, I are not in the word.

We need a word fitting the pattern _ E _ _ T, containing R at position 3 or 4, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **BERET** fits:
- B E R E T → E is correctly at position 2, T at position 5.
- R is at position 3 (acceptable).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus “BERET” is a logical next guess.
