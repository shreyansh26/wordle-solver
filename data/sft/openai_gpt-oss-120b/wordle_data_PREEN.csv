### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with an initial guess that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to gather information. A good starter word is “CRANE” because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the common vowels A and E. This will help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We know:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- C and A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word with R fixed in the second slot, containing N and E in different positions (avoiding N in slot 4 and E in slot 5), and no C or A.

A good candidate is **GREEN**:
- Pattern: G R E E N
- R is in position 2 (matches).
- Contains E (now in positions 3 and 4, not position 5).
- Contains N in position 5 (not position 4).
- No prohibited letters.
