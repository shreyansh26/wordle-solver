### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with an initial guess that covers a mix of common letters and positions. A good starter word is ""CRANE"" because it contains common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N). This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We have two previous guesses:

Thus the secret word contains only the letters C and R (so far) plus three other unknown letters, none of which can be A, N, E, S, O, P.  
Constraints on placements:
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

A valid word that respects these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **RUBIC**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).

The word **BIRCH** fits this pattern (B I R C H) and uses only allowed letters, placing each in an allowed position. It also introduces a new fifth letter (H) which hasn't been ruled out.
