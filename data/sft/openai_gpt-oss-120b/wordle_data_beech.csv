### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does **not** contain the letters S, L, A, or T.  
The letter E is present but not in the 5th position (it was 5th in SLATE). Therefore E must be somewhere in positions 1‑4.

Our next guess should:
- Exclude S, L, A, T completely.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CHIEF -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(-) I(x) E(-) F(x)
Guess 3: BERRY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) R(x) R(x) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have deduced the following from the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, I, F, R, Y.
- Letter E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (got '-' when placed there) and now we know it is correctly at position 2 from the BERRY guess.
- Letter B is correctly at position 1 (✓ from BERRY).
Thus the secret word pattern is **B E _ _ _**.

We need a common English word starting with ""BE"" that uses only letters not eliminated. Possible remaining letters: D, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The word **BEGUN** fits: B (position1) and E (position2) are confirmed, and G, U, N are all allowed letters. It is a valid 5‑letter English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be BEGUN.

We have confirmed B in position 1 and E in position 2.  
From CHIEF we learned that C and H are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.  
The remaining letters must avoid those already marked absent (S, L, A, T, I, F, R, Y, G, U, N).  

A word that fits the pattern B E _ _ _ and includes both C and H while using only allowed letters is **BEECH** (B E E C H).  
This places C at position 4 and H at position 5, respecting the earlier position constraints, and repeats E at position 3, which is allowed.
