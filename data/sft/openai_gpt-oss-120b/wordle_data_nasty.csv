### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word must contain both A and N, placed elsewhere. I need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N, avoids C, R, E, and does not put A in the 3rd slot or N in the 4th slot. “SANTA” (S‑A‑N‑T‑A) satisfies all these constraints and introduces three new letters (S, T, and another A) to gather more information.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 is **A** (green from SANTA).
- Position 4 is **T** (green from SANTA).
- Letters **S**, **N**, and another **A** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SANTA (so S is not in position 1, N is not in position 3, and the second A is not in position 5).
- Letters **C**, **R**, **E** are not in the word at all.

A word that respects these constraints and introduces a new letter is **NASTY**:
- N in position 1 (allowed, N cannot be position 3 or 4).
- A in position 2 (already confirmed).
- S in position 3 (S is not allowed in position 1, so position 3 is fine).
- T in position 4 (already confirmed).
- Y in position 5 (new letter, also not prohibited).

This guess keeps all known correct letters in place, respects the “wrong‑position” clues, and tests a new letter (Y) to narrow down the solution.
