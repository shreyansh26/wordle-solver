### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has R in the second position and does not contain the letters C, A, N, or E anywhere. For the next guess we should choose a 5‑letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Avoids C, A, N, E entirely.
- Introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **PROUD** (P R O U D). It satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh letters to evaluate.

We know the secret word has R in the second position. Letters C, A, N, E, P, O, D are not in the word. The letter U is in the word but not in position four. Therefore, we need a word with pattern _ R _ _ _, containing U in position 1, 3, or 5, and avoiding the excluded letters. “TRUST” fits: T R U S T (R fixed, U in position 3, no excluded letters).
