### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This should give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, L, S are not in the secret word.
- Letter E is in the secret word but not in positions 5 (from CRANE) nor 3 (from BLESS).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Includes E, placed at a position other than 3 or 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.
- Introduces fresh letters to gather more information.

The word **DEITY** satisfies these constraints:
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- Contains only new letters D, I, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it will give useful new feedback.
