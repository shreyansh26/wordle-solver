### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore the next guess should:
- Include the letter E in a position other than 5.
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SLEET**:
- Contains E at positions 3 and 4 (both not position 5).
- Uses new letters S, L, and T, none of which have been ruled out.
- No prohibited letters are present.

Thus, the next guess will be SLEET.

We have the following information:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (SLEET): 
  * S and T are not in the word.
  * L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
  * One E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
  * Another E is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is definitely **E**).
  * Because the E at position 3 received a “-”, the secret word must contain **at least two E’s** – one at position 4 and another not at position 3 (and not at position 5 from the first clue).

Thus the pattern is:

1️⃣ ? 2️⃣ ? 3️⃣ ? 4️⃣ E 5️⃣ ?

Additional constraints:
- L must appear somewhere other than position 2 (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- The second E must be at position 1 or 2 (since position 3 is ruled out and position 5 is ruled out by the first clue).

We need a common five‑letter word that satisfies all of these constraints and introduces new letters for further testing.  
**LEVEL** fits perfectly:
- Positions: L E V E L
- Position 4 is **E** (matches the confirmed green).
- Contains two E’s (positions 2 and 4); the extra E is not at position 3 or 5.
- Contains L, which is not in position 2 (L is at positions 1 and 5).
- Introduces a new letter **V** while avoiding all letters already known to be absent (C,R,A,N,S,T).

Therefore, “LEVEL” is a logical next guess.

- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, T, V (all got gray feedback).

- Position 5 is L (green from LEVEL).
- The letter L exists elsewhere (yellow in SLEET and LEVEL), satisfied by its presence at position 5, so there is likely only one L.
- The only E in the word is at position 4 (the other E’s in previous guesses were yellow because they matched the single E at position 4).
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, T, V (all got gray feedback).
- L cannot be at positions 1 or 2 (both were yellow), so L is only at position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E L.

We need a common 5‑letter English word ending in “EL” with an E in the fourth slot, avoiding the excluded letters. Viable candidates include **MODEL** (M O D E L) and **PIXEL** (P I X E L). Both satisfy all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess (CRANE) that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore the next guess should:
- Include the letter E in a position other than 5.
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SLEET**:
- Contains E at positions 3 and 4 (both not position 5).
- Uses new letters S, L, and T, none of which have been ruled out.
- No prohibited letters are present.

Thus, the next guess will be SLEET.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) E(-) E(✓) T(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (SLEET): 
  * S and T are not in the word.
  * L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
  * One E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
  * Another E is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is definitely **E**).
  * Because the E at position 3 received a “-”, the secret word must contain **at least two E’s** – one at position 4 and another not at position 3 (and not at position 5 from the first clue).

Thus the pattern is:

1️⃣ ? 2️⃣ ? 3️⃣ ? 4️⃣ E 5️⃣ ?

Additional constraints:
- L must appear somewhere other than position 2 (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- The second E must be at position 1 or 2 (since position 3 is ruled out and position 5 is ruled out by the first clue).

We need a common five‑letter word that satisfies all of these constraints and introduces new letters for further testing.  
**LEVEL** fits perfectly:
- Positions: L E V E L
- Position 4 is **E** (matches the confirmed green).
- Contains two E’s (positions 2 and 4); the extra E is not at position 3 or 5.
- Contains L, which is not in position 2 (L is at positions 1 and 5).
- Introduces a new letter **V** while avoiding all letters already known to be absent (C,R,A,N,S,T).

Therefore, “LEVEL” is a logical next guess.

We have the following confirmed letters from previous feedback:

- Position 4 = E (green from SLEET, LEVEL, and MODEL).
- Position 5 = L (green from LEVEL and MODEL).

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ E L.

- B is unused and not excluded.
- O is already fixed at position 2.
- W is a new letter not yet ruled out.
- E at position 4 matches the confirmed green.
- L at position 5 matches the confirmed green.

Therefore the next logical guess is **BOWEL**.
