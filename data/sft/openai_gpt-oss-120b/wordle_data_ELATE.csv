2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback shows that letters L, A, T, E are correct and in the right positions (2‑5). The first letter is not S. So the secret word must be ? L A T E. A common word fitting this pattern is PLATE. I’ll guess that.

We have determined that letters in positions 2-5 (L A T E) are confirmed correct. The first letter is unknown but not S or P (both gave x). The only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern _LATE is ELATE. No other common words seem plausible. So guess ELATE.
