### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a broad coverage of possible letters and positions.

We know C is in the secret word but not in the first position. Letters R, A, N, E are ruled out completely. For the next guess I want to keep C (not first) and test several new common letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “SCOLD” places C in the second position and introduces S, O, L, D for new information.
