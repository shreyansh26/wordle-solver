### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C is in the word but not in position 1 → C must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.
- A is correct and fixed at position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word with A at the third spot, containing a C somewhere other than the first position, and without R, N, or E.

The word **SCAMP** fits:
- Position 1 = S (allowed)

- C is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2; therefore C must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters R, N, E, S, M, P are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter English word with A third, C fourth (or fifth), and none of the excluded letters.  
The word **BLACK** fits all constraints:
- B (allowed) L (allowed) A (✓) C (now correctly placed) K (allowed)
No prohibited letters appear.

Thus the next guess is BLACK.

<guess>BLACK</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: BLACK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- Position 3 = A, position 4 = C, position 5 = K (from BLACK feedback).
- Letters B, L, R, N, E, S, M, P are not in the word.
- C cannot be in positions 1‑2, already placed at 4.
Thus the word pattern is __ACK with the first two letters not among excluded ones.
Possible common words fitting __ACK and avoiding excluded letters include “WHACK” (W, H) and “QUACK” (Q, U). Both satisfy all known constraints.
I will try “WHACK” as the next guess.

We have confirmed letters: position 3 = A, position 4 = C, position 5 = K.
Eliminated letters from previous feedback: R, N, E, S, M, P, B, L, W, H.
The remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2 are any that are not eliminated and not already placed (C, A, K). A common 5‑letter word ending in “ACK” that avoids the eliminated letters is **QUACK** (Q and U are both unused).
Thus the next guess should be QUACK.
