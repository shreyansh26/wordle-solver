### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the first, second, third, and fifth letters are correct: C, R, A, and E respectively. The fourth letter is not N and hasn't been identified yet. So the secret word must be of the form C R A _ E. A common English word fitting that pattern is ""CRATE"".

We know the secret word has C, R, A, ?, E in positions 1-5 respectively. The fourth letter cannot be N or T. We need a common English word matching C R A _ E. Potential candidates: CRANE (already ruled out because N is wrong), CRATE (T is wrong), CRAVE (V is untested), CRAZE (Z), CRACE (not common), CRAPE (P). Among these, CRAVE is a common word and fits the constraints. So we should guess CRAVE to test the fourth letter.
