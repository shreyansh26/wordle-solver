### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to give useful information for the next rounds.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: all letters C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From LIGHT: L(-) and I(-) mean L and I are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed. L is not in position 1, I is not in position 2. G, H, T are also not in the word.

So the secret word must contain L and I, with L not in the first slot and I not in the second slot. It cannot contain any of the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T}. Remaining letters we can use are {B,D,F,J,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} plus L and I.

A good next guess is a common 5‑letter word that includes L and I in new positions and introduces several new letters to gather more info. “SLIMY” fits:
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L was only ruled out from position 1).
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since I was only ruled out from position 2).
- New letters S, M, Y give fresh information and are not in the eliminated set.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From CRANE: all letters C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From LIGHT: L(-) and I(-) mean L and I are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed. L is not in position 1, I is not in position 2. G, H, T are also not in the word.

So the secret word must contain L and I, with L not in the first slot and I not in the second slot. It cannot contain any of the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T}. Remaining letters we can use are {B,D,F,J,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} plus L and I.

A good next guess is a common 5‑letter word that includes L and I in new positions and introduces several new letters to gather more info. “SLIMY” fits:
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L was only ruled out from position 1).
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since I was only ruled out from position 2).
- New letters S, M, Y give fresh information and are not in the eliminated set.

Thus the next guess will be SLIMY.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (‑).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (‑).

Eliminated letters (x): C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, M, Y.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with S, containing L and I in positions other than those ruled out.  
A good candidate is **SOLID**:
- S is position 1 (matches ✓).  
- L is position 3 (allowed, not position 2).  
- I is position 4 (allowed, not position 3).  
- O and D are new letters to test and are not among the eliminated set.

Thus we guess SOLID.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 4: I (✓)
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (and not position 2 has not been ruled out yet).
- Letters eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T,M,Y,D.

Thus the secret word must be of the form S _ _ I _. The remaining letters to place are L and O (in positions that respect the constraints) plus one new letter.

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **SPOIL**:
- S is at position 1 (matches ✓).
- O is at position 3 (allowed, not position 2).
- I is at position 4 (matches ✓).
- L is at position 5 (allowed, not positions 1‑3).
- P is a new letter to test.

Therefore the next guess should be SPOIL.
