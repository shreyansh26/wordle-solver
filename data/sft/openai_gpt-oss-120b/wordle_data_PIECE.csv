### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a first guess that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful information. 
A good starter word is “SLATE” because it includes three common consonants (S, L, T) and two frequent vowels (A, E). This should give a broad spread of feedback for the secret word.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5 is correct). The letters S, L, A, T are not present anywhere. So the next guess must:

We have feedback:

- From SLATE: only E is correct (position 5). S, L, A, T are not in the word.
- From CRIME: C is in the word but not at position 1, R not in the word, I is in the word but not at position 3, M not in the word, E is correct at position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains C (not at position 1) and I (not at position 3).
- Does NOT contain: S, L, A, T, R, M.
- Needs two more letters that are not among the excluded set.

We need a valid English word fitting these constraints. “NICHE” satisfies all:

- I is at position 2 (not position 3), C is at position 3 (not position 1).

Thus it’s a good next guess.
