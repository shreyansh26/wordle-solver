### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common, balanced starter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants.  
“CRANE” is a good choice because it includes two frequent vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

The first guess gave feedback: C is in the word but not in position 1, while R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. Therefore the next guess must:
- Include the letter C, but not as the first letter.
- Exclude the letters R, A, N, E entirely.
Choosing a common word that meets these constraints helps test new letters. “BLOCK” has C in the fourth position and contains none of the excluded letters.
