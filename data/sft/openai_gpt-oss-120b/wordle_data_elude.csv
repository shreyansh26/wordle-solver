### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- L is correct in position 2.
- D is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

All other letters used so far (S, A, T, C, O, V, G, I) are known not to appear in the secret word.

The pattern is therefore: _ L _ D E.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word matching this pattern and using only letters that have not been ruled out. The word **ELUDE** fits:
- Position 1: E (allowed, even though E already appears at position 5)
- Position 2: L (confirmed)
- Position 3: U (new letter, not yet excluded)
- Position 4: D (confirmed)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)

Thus ELUDE is a logical next guess.
