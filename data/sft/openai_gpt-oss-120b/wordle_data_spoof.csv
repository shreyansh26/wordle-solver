### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H, T, B, L, W** are confirmed not in the secret word.
- Letter **O** is correct and in the correct position (3rd).
- Letter **S** is in the word but NOT in the 5th position, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Remaining possible letters are: **D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z**.

We need a new word that:
1. Has **O** as the 3rd letter.
2. Places **S** in a position other than 5 (1, 2, or 4).
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

The word **SPOKY** satisfies all conditions:
- Pattern **S _ O _ _** (S in position 1, O in position 3).
- Uses letters **S, P, O, K, Y**, all of which are still possible.
- Provides fresh letters (P, K, Y) to further narrow down the solution.

Thus the next guess should be **SPOKY**.

We have determined the secret word pattern so far:
- Position 1: S (✓ from SPOKY)
- Position 2: P (✓ from SPOKY)
- Position 3: O (✓ from both BLOWS and SPOKY)
- Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown.

All letters marked “x” so far are excluded: A, B, C, E, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, R, T, W, Y.  
Letters still possible include D, F, J, Q, U, V, X, Z and also O (which can repeat).

A common English word that fits the pattern S P O _ _ and uses only allowed letters is **SPOOF** (S P O O F).  
- It keeps the confirmed letters in the correct spots.  
- It introduces a new letter F (still untested) and repeats O, which is allowed.

Thus the next guess should be SPOOF.
