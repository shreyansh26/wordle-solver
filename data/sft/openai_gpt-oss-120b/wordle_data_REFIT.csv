### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess “CRANE” we learned:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the next guess must contain R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot. “RILED” satisfies all of those conditions (R at 1, E at 4, no forbidden letters). This will give us new information about the remaining letters and positions.

- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- Letters C, A, N, L, D are not in the word.

The word **REMIX** satisfies all conditions:

Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, D, M, X, plus any others marked x.

Thus the secret word fits pattern **R E _ I _** with unknown letters at positions 3 and 5, none of which may be among the excluded letters.

A common English word matching this pattern and using only allowed letters is **REFIT** (R‑E‑F‑I‑T). Neither F nor T have been ruled out, so this guess is consistent with all prior feedback.
