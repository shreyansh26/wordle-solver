I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), giving me useful information about which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

From the first guess CRANE, we know:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N in different positions, avoids C, R, and E, and uses other common letters to gather more information. “MASON” fits: it contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), and introduces M, S, O as new letters.

We know only A and N are in the secret word. Their forbidden positions:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
All other letters used so far (C,R,E,M,S,O) are confirmed not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word containing A and N, placing them in allowed spots, and using three other letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
The word **ANVIL** fits:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- N is in position 2 (allowed).
- V, I, L are new letters not yet tested and none are among the excluded set.
Thus it gives new information while respecting all constraints.
