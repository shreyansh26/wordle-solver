### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with E and contains an N somewhere in positions 1‑3. A good next guess should place N in one of those spots and keep E at the end, while avoiding C, R, A. “KNIFE” puts N in position 2, keeps E at the end, and introduces new letters K, I, F to gather more information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = N (✓ from guess 2 and 3)
- Position 4 = I (✓ from guess 3)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from all guesses)

Letters excluded (marked x): C, R, A, K, F, D, plus any others not present.
Letter I is also known to be elsewhere (the first I in guess 2 was “-”, meaning I is in the word but not at position 3). We now have I at position 4, satisfying that.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ N _ I E.

We need a valid English word with that pattern, using only letters not excluded. A good candidate is **ENLIE** (E‑N‑L‑I‑E):
- Introduces new letter L.
- Places E also at position 1, which we haven’t ruled out.
- Keeps the known correct letters in their spots.

This guess will confirm whether L is correct and whether the word contains a second E.

We have confirmed the following from feedback:
- Position 2 = N (✓)
- Position 4 = I (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)
- Letter E is not in position 1 (dash on ENLIE)
- Letter I is not in position 3 (dash on KNIFE) and not in position 1 (dash on INDIE)
- Letters C, R, A, K, F, D, L are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ N _ I E, with the first letter not E, not I, not any excluded letters, and the third letter not D, L, etc.

A common English word matching this pattern and satisfying all constraints is **UNTIE** (U N T I E).

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters U and T while keeping the known correct letters in place.
