### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I'll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

We have N in position 4 and E in position 5 (from first guess). From the second guess, T is in the word but not in position 2, so T must be either position 1 or 3. Trying a common word with T at position 1 fits: TWINE (T W I N E). This uses new letters W and I, avoids all letters known to be absent, and respects the placement constraints.
