### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, V, O, Y, H, plus any letters shown as “x”.  
Remaining unknown letters are at positions 2 and 3, and must be chosen from letters not yet ruled out (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z).

A good next guess should keep the confirmed letters S _ _ E N, and introduce a new letter (e.g., K) while also checking whether a second E is allowed. “SKEEN” fits this pattern and tests K plus the duplicate E.

So the next guess is:

<guess>SKEEN</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

We have determined the confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: N (✓)

From the feedback on SKEEN, the E in position 3 received a “-”, which means there is another E elsewhere in the word (since only one E would have been marked “x”). The only remaining place for that second E is position 2 (positions 1, 3, 5 are taken). Thus the pattern is:

S E _ E N

The only common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not yet eliminated is **SEMEN** (M has not been ruled out). This guess will test the remaining unknown slot.
