### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which will give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. A good opening guess is “CRANE” because it includes the common vowel A and the frequent consonants C, R, N, and E. This should quickly reveal which letters are present and in what positions.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, A, E are not in the word at all.
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ N _.  
We need a word fitting that pattern using letters other than C, A, E.  
Choosing a word with three new letters will give the most information.  
""GRIND"" matches the pattern (G R I N D) and introduces G, I, D, none of which have been tested yet.
