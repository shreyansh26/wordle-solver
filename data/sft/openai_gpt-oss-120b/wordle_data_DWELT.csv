### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To confirm which of the previously eliminated letters might actually still be present (in case of any mis‑interpretation), I’ll guess a word that includes several of those letters while keeping L and T in the correct spots. “SMELT” fits this pattern and introduces S, M, and E for further testing.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

We have determined the secret word ends with ""ELT"": from the fourth guess SMELT, feedback shows E, L, T are correct in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively. L was previously known to be in position 4, T in 5. The first two letters are still unknown, but we have eliminated many letters: S, A, I, G, H, M, U, C, and also from earlier guesses S, M, etc. The remaining plausible letters can be any not yet excluded. A common English word that fits the pattern __ELT is ""KNELT"" (K N E L T). K and N have not been used or excluded yet, so this guess will test the remaining positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- S, A, E are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new guess containing L and T in different positions from those ruled out, and three other letters that haven’t been eliminated. “LIGHT” satisfies these constraints:
- L is in position 1 (allowed).
- T is in position 5 (allowed).
- It avoids S, A, and E.
- Introduces new letters I, G, H for more information.

We need a new guess that places L in position 3 or 4, keeps T at 5, and uses only letters not yet ruled out. The word ""MULCT"" fits:
- Positions: M(1), U(2), L(3), C(4), T(5)
- L is at position 3 (allowed), T is correct at 5.
- New letters M, U, C are untested and not among eliminated letters.
Thus this guess will give us more information.
