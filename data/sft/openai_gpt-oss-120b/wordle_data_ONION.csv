### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.  
Letter N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (since it was wrong in both those spots). Therefore N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We need a new word that:
- Contains N in one of those allowed positions.
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- Introduces fresh letters to gather more information.

The word **DUNKS** fits:
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses only new letters D, U, K, S, none of which have been ruled out.
- Provides a good mix of consonants to test further.

Thus the next guess is DUNKS.

We have determined the only confirmed letters so far:
- N is correct in position 5 (from BLOWN: N ✓).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (from BLOWN: O ‑).

All letters marked “x” are eliminated: A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, K, L, R, S, T, U, W.

Remaining possible letters are: F, J, M, N, O, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with N, containing O somewhere other than the 3rd slot, using only the remaining letters.  
The word **PYXON** (P Y X O N) satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with N (position 5).
- O is in position 4, not position 3.
- All letters (P, Y, X, O, N) are from the allowed set.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The confirmed letters are O in the 4th position and N in the 5th position (pattern ___ON).  
All other letters guessed so far (C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T, D, U, K, S, B, L, W, P, Y, X) have been marked as not present.  
The only letters not yet tested are F, J, M, Q, V, Z.  
Finding a common English word that fits ___ON using only those letters is essentially impossible, suggesting an earlier elimination might be wrong or the word is obscure.

The most common English word that fits the pattern ___ON is **MELON**. Although L and E were previously marked as absent, guessing this word gives the best chance of hitting the secret word.

Thus, I will guess “MELON”.
