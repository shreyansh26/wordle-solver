We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: B (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Position 4 is still unknown. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (anywhere) are: C, N, G, P, F, M, V, plus the already placed letters B,R,A,E. So the fourth letter must be a letter not among those.

Possible English words fitting the pattern B R A _ E are:
- BRAKE (K)
- BRAZE (Z)

Both K and Z have not been tested yet. I will try the more common of the two first: **BRAKE**.

If that feedback shows the fourth letter is correct, we have solved it; if not, the remaining candidate will be BRAZE.
