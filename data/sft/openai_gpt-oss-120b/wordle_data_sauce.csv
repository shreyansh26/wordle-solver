### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two of the most frequent letters (C, R, N) and both vowels A and E, giving useful information about the secret word's letters and positions.

We know:
- Secret ends with E (position 5 correct).
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R and N are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing both C and A, with C not at position 1 and A not at position 3, and avoiding R and N.

The word **ALICE** satisfies all conditions:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 1) and C (position 4).
- No R or N present.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C is in the word but not in position 1; A is in the word but not in position 3; R and N are not in the word; E is correct at position 5.
- From ALICE: A is in the word but not in position 1; L and I are not in the word; C is correct at position 4; E is correct at position 5.

Combining these, the secret pattern is:
1️⃣ ? 2️⃣ A 3️⃣ ? 4️⃣ C 5️⃣ E

Letters that cannot appear: R, N, L, I.

We need a common 5‑letter word fitting “? A ? C E”. The word **SAUCE** matches perfectly:
- S at position 1 (allowed)
- A at position 2 (required)
- U at position 3 (allowed)
- C at position 4 (confirmed)
- E at position 5 (confirmed)

Thus SAUCE is a valid next guess.
