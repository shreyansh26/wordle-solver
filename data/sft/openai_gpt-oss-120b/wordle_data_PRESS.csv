### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a solid, common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two of the most common vowels (A, E). This should give me useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct in the second position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Thus the secret word has the pattern _ R _ _ _. The letter E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4. We must avoid using C, A, N. A good next guess should keep R second and place E elsewhere, while introducing new letters to test. ""TRIED"" fits: T R I E D, with R in the correct slot and E in position 4 (not the last), and it adds the new letters T, I, D for further clues.
