### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C and R are not in the word at all.
- A, N, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position.
So the secret word must contain A, N, E somewhere other than positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively, and must not contain C or R.

We need a five‑letter word using A, N, E plus two other letters (not C or R) that respects these position constraints.  

“LANES” fits:
- Contains A, N, E.
- Positions: L(1) A(2) N(3) E(4) S(5)
  • A is not in position 3 → good.
  • N is not in position 4 → good.
  • E is not in position 5 → good.
- No C or R present.

Thus “LANES” is a valid next guess.
