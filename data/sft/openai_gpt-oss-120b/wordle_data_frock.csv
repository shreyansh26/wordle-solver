### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that covers a variety of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give us useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know the secret word has R as the second letter. The letter C is in the word but not in the first position, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all. I’ll choose a word that keeps R in the second spot, includes C in a later position, and avoids A, N, E. “TRICK” fits: T R I C K (C is in position 4, satisfying the “‑” clue). This will give new information about the remaining letters.

We have derived the pattern from feedback:

- Position 2 is R (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 4 is C (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 5 is K (✓ from guess 2).
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (from guess 1), which matches C being in position 4.
- Letters A, N, E, T, I are not in the word (x feedback).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ R _ C K, using only letters not eliminated. A common English word that matches is **FROCK** (F R O C K). It respects all known constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""FROCK"".
