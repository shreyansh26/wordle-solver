### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain S, A, or E. It DOES contain L and T, but L is NOT in position 2 and T is NOT in position 4 (their positions from the first guess). Therefore the next guess should include L and T in different slots, and avoid the letters S, A, E. A good candidate is “CLOTH”, which keeps L and T, places them in new positions, and introduces three new letters (C, O, H) to gather more information.

We know:
- O is correct at position 3 (from CLOTH).
- L is in the word but not at position 2 (both guesses).
- T is in the word but not at position 4 (both guesses).
- Eliminated letters: S, A, E, C, H.

We need a new word with O in the 3rd slot, containing L and T in positions other than those ruled out, and introducing fresh letters to test.  
The word **TROLL** satisfies:
- T at position 1 (allowed),
- O at position 3 (fixed),
- L at positions 4 and 5 (both allowed, not position 2),
- introduces a new letter R while avoiding eliminated letters.

Thus TROLL is a valid next guess.
