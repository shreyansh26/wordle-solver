### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter.

We know the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5. C and R are both in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. N is not in the word.  
We need a new guess that respects the known positions and avoids placing C or R where they are already ruled out.  
Choosing “GLARE” gives:
- A at position 3 (correct)
- E at position 5 (correct)
- Places R at position 4 (allowed, since R is not allowed at position 2)
- Introduces new letters G and L to test other possibilities while not violating any known constraints.

We have confirmed positions: A is correct at position 3, E at position 5. From guess 2, R at position 4 is correct. C is in the word (from guess 1) but not at position 1; it cannot be at positions 3‑5, so it must be position 2. Therefore the pattern is _ C A R E. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **SCARE**. This also introduces a new letter S, which hasn't been ruled out.
