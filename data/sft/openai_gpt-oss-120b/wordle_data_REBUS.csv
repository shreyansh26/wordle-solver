### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain R and E, placed elsewhere, and avoid C, A, N. A good next guess is a common word that includes R and E in new positions while introducing new letters to test. “ROPER” fits: it has R (positions 1 and 5) and E (position 4), none of the forbidden letters, and gives us fresh letters O and P to evaluate.

Thus the next guess will be:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form **R E _ _ _** with another R at position 3 or 4, and without any excluded letters.

A valid candidate that satisfies all conditions is **REDRY**:
- R at 1 (✓)
- E at 2 (✓)
- Second R at position 4 (fits the yellow from guess 2)
- New letters D and Y have not been tested yet.

Thus the next guess should be REDRY.

We have determined the following from the feedback:

- Position 1 is **R** (green from guess 2 and 3).
- Position 2 is **E** (green from guess 3).
- The word contains a second **R** that is not in position 5 (yellow on the second R in guess 2) and not in position 4 (yellow on the R in guess 4). Therefore the second R must be in position 3.
- Letters **C, A, N, O, P, M, I, T, D, Y** are all confirmed absent.

So the pattern is **R E R _ _** with the last two letters still unknown, but they must not be any of the excluded letters.

A common word fitting this pattern and introducing new letters is **RERUN** (introducing U and N). This will test the remaining possibilities.

Thus the next guess is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a new guess that keeps R at position 1, places E somewhere other than position 4, and introduces new letters while avoiding the known excluded letters (C, A, N, O, P).  

The word **REMIT** fits:

- New letters M, I, T to test other positions.
