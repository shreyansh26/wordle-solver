### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “SLATE” showed that none of its letters (S, L, A, T, E) are in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these five letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word using different letters to gather more information. “CRONY” contains C, R, O, N, Y, none of which appeared in the first guess, making it a good candidate.

We have the following feedback:
- From SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.
- From CRONY: C is NOT, R is correct at position 2, O is correct at position 3, N and Y are NOT.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ R O _ _. The remaining unknown letters cannot be any of the eliminated ones (S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y). Good candidate words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are:
- PROUD (P R O U D)
- PROOF (P R O O F)
- BROOD (B R O O D)
- etc.

Choosing PROUD introduces three new letters (P, U, D) while keeping the known correct positions for R and O, giving us useful information.

So the next guess will be PROUD.
