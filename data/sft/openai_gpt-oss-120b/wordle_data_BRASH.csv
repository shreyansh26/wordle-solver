### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R A _ _. The remaining letters cannot be C, N, or E. A suitable common English word fitting this pattern is **GRASP** (G‑R‑A‑S‑P), which respects all known constraints.

We have confirmed letters from feedback:
- Position 2 = R (✓ from both guesses)
- Position 3 = A (✓ from both guesses)
- Position 4 = S (✓ from second guess)

Letters ruled out: C, N, E, G, P (all marked x). So the secret word fits the pattern _ R A S _. 

Candidate common English words matching this pattern include “BRASH” (B R A S H) and “BRASS” (B R A S S). Both satisfy known constraints; “BRASH” tests a new letter H at position 5, while “BRASS” repeats S at the end. To maximize new information, I’ll guess “BRASH”.
