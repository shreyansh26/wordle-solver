# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

So the secret word must contain the letters R and E, but R cannot be the second letter and E cannot be the fifth letter. It must not contain C, A, or N anywhere.

We have determined the constraints from previous feedback:
- R is confirmed at position 3.
- E is in the word but cannot be at positions 2 or 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4.
- Letters C, A, N, M, I, and T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word matching the pattern _ _ R _ _. It must contain E at position 1 or 4, and use only allowed letters.

The word **SHRED** fits perfectly:
- Position 3 is R (✓).
- Position 4 is E, satisfying the “E not in positions 2 or 5” rule.
- All other letters (S, H, D) are not among the excluded letters.

Thus SHRED is a valid next guess.
