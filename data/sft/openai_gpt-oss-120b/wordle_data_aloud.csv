### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the first three letters:
- Position 1: A (green)
- Position 2: L (green)
- Position 3: O (green)

Feedback so far:
- Position 4 cannot be H (gray) and cannot be O (the second O gave a yellow, meaning O exists elsewhere, already satisfied by position 3).
- Position 5 cannot be A (yellow on the A guess means A is elsewhere, already at position 1).

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, G, M, F, H (all marked gray).

We need a common 5‑letter word of the form **A L O _ _** using only letters not yet excluded.  
A good candidate is **ALOUD** (A L O U D), which introduces two new letters U and D that have not been tested and fits all the positional constraints.

Thus the next guess is:
