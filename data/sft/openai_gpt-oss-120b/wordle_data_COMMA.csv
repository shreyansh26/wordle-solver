### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter in these word‑guessing games because it tests several different letters (C, R, A, N, E) and includes a vowel. This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct in position 1). R, N, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5. To get more information, I’ll pick a word that keeps C in the first spot, puts A in a new spot (position 2), and introduces three fresh letters that haven’t been tested yet, while avoiding the known‑absent letters R, N, and E.
The word **CAVIL** fits these criteria:
- C is still first.
- A is now in position 2 (testing if A belongs there).
- V, I, L are new letters to explore.
Thus, CAVIL is a good next guess.

We know the secret word:

- Contains the letter A, but not in positions 2 or 3. So A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters R, N, E, V, I, L are not in the word.

We need a new guess that keeps C at the first spot, places A at a new possible location (position 5 works well), and introduces fresh letters not yet ruled out.  
Choosing **COMMA** gives:
- C in position 1 (still correct).
- A in position 5 (testing if A belongs there).
- New letters O, M, M to test additional possibilities while avoiding the excluded letters.
