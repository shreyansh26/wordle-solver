### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- Letters not in the word (x): C, R, A, N, S, I, D, J, O.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced (-): L and U.
- L cannot be in position 2 (from SLIDE) nor position 4 (from JOULE), so L is either position 1 or 3.
- U cannot be in position 3 (from JOULE), so U can be positions 1,2, or 4.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing both L and U, respecting these position constraints, and using only letters not ruled out.

The word **BULGE** fits:
- Pattern B U L G E → E at position 5.
- L is in position 3 (allowed) and not in positions 2 or 4.
- U is in position 2 (allowed) and not in position 3.
- Remaining letters B and G have not been excluded.

Thus BULGE is a valid next guess.
