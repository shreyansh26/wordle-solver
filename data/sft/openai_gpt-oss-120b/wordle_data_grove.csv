### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a valid five‑letter English word. A good opening guess is one that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful information. ""SLATE"" fits this: it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

The feedback tells me that the only correct letter so far is E in the fifth position. All other letters (S, L, A, T) are not in the word at any position. Therefore my next guess must have E in the fifth position and must avoid using S, L, A, or T anywhere. I’ll choose a word with new letters to test other possibilities, such as “BRINE” (B‑R‑I‑N‑E).
