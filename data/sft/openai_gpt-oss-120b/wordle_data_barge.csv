### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We have determined:
- Position 2 is A (from RAISE).
- Position 5 is E (from both guesses).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so R must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters C, N, I, S are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is _ A _ _ E with R at position 3 or 4.

Possible words fitting this pattern include **LARGE** (L A R G E) and **BARGE** (B A R G E). Both satisfy the known constraints and introduce new letters to test.

I will guess ""LARGE"" to continue narrowing down the solution.
