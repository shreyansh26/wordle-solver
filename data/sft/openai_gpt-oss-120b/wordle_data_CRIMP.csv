### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening guess in letter‑position games is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the common vowels A and E, giving a broad coverage of possible letters.

We know the secret word starts with ""C"" and ""R"" in the first two positions, and does not contain the letters A, N, or E anywhere. We need a valid 5‑letter word beginning with ""CR"" that avoids those letters. Possible candidates include ""CRISP"", ""CROWD"", ""CRUMB"", etc. I'll choose ""CRISP"" as the next guess.

We have determined the exact positions for four letters:
- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: R (confirmed)
- Position 3: I (confirmed)
- Position 5: P (confirmed)

The only unknown is the fourth letter. The feedback tells us that S is not in the word, and we already know A, N, E are excluded from earlier guesses. We need a valid English word matching the pattern C R I _ P.

The word “CRIMP” fits perfectly: C‑R‑I‑M‑P, uses a new letter M for the fourth position, and is a common English word. This will test the remaining unknown slot.

Thus the next guess should be “CRIMP”.
