### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess (CRANE) tells us:
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is correct in the third position.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.

Therefore the secret word has the form _ _ A _ _, includes an R somewhere other than position 2, and must avoid C, N, and E.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **ROAST**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- O, S, and T are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No forbidden letters (C, N, E) are present.
- A remains in the required third position.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letter **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (R - from ROAST).
- Letter **S** is in the word but not in position 4 (S - from ROAST).

Thus we need a word of the form __A__ that contains **R** (somewhere except position 1) and **S** (somewhere except position 4), and uses only letters that are not ruled out.

A good candidate is **SHARP**:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, S not at 4).

- A is correct in the third position.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.

Therefore the secret word has the form _ _ A _ _, includes an R somewhere other than position 2, and must avoid C, N, and E.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **ROAST**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- O, S, and T are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No forbidden letters (C, N, E) are present.
- A remains in the required third position.

I’ll guess ROAST.

<guess>ROAST</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- The secret word is 5 letters.
- Position 3 is definitely **A** (A ✓).
- Letters **C**, **N**, **E**, **O**, **T** are not in the word (x feedback).
- Letter **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (R - from ROAST).
- Letter **S** is in the word but not in position 4 (S - from ROAST).

Thus we need a word of the form __A__ that contains **R** (somewhere except position 1) and **S** (somewhere except position 4), and uses only letters that are not ruled out.

A good candidate is **SHARP**:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, S not at 4).
- H is a new letter.
- A is correctly at position 3.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, R not at 1).
- P is a new letter.

All letters satisfy the constraints, so we’ll guess **SHARP**.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

Guess 3: SHARP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) P(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: not H, not any eliminated letters (C, N, E, O, T)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: R (✓)
- Position 5: not P, and cannot be any eliminated letters.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S ? A R ?** with only letters that haven't been ruled out. The word “SWARD” (meaning a stretch of grass) matches this pattern: S‑W‑A‑R‑D. Both W and D are letters we have not yet tested and are not among the eliminated letters.

I will guess **SWARD**.

The only common English word that fits the pattern **S W A R _** and uses a letter not yet excluded is **SWARM** (with **M** in the fifth position). M has not been ruled out, so this is a logical next guess.
