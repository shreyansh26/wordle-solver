### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback so far tells us:
- Position 2 is E (from DENSE).
- Position 3 is N (consistent from earlier guesses).
- Position 4 is S (from DENSE).
- Position 5 is E (consistent from earlier guesses).
Thus the word pattern is ? E N S E.

All letters marked x are not in the word: C, R, A, L, U, G, T, O, D.  
The only plausible English word that fits the pattern and avoids those letters is **SENSE**.

So the next guess should be SENSE.
