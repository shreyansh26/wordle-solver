### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess for a 5‑letter secret word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common starter that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowel positions to gather useful feedback. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, or “AUDIO” are popular first guesses. I’ll go with **CRANE** because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) in varied positions.

The feedback tells me:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is correct and in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret pattern is _ _ _ N _.  
E must appear in one of the first three positions.  
I need a new guess that respects the known constraints and tests new letters.  
“SHONE” fits: it places N correctly at position 4, includes E (though at position 5, which we know is wrong, giving a “-” again), and introduces S, H, and O for further testing while avoiding C, R, and A.

We have confirmed:

- E is in the word but not at position 5, and from two guesses we know it must be in positions 1‑3.
- Letters C, R, A, S, H, O are not in the word.

- E is in positions 1 and 3,

- V and T are new letters to test, and none are excluded.
