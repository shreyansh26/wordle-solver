### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and different vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter: it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving a broad coverage of possible letters.

We know from the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (the position it occupied in CRANE).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains both A and E, places them in different positions than those ruled out, and avoids C, R, N. Choosing a common word that introduces new letters will give more information.

""PLEAD"" fits:
- Contains A (position 4) and E (position 3), both allowed.
- Uses new letters P, L, D, none of which have been ruled out.
- No C, R, or N.

Thus ""PLEAD"" is a good next guess.

We have the following information from the feedback:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, N, L.
- Letter **E** is correct at position 3.
- Letter **A** is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 5.
- Letter **P** is in the word but not at position 1 → possible positions 2, 4, 5.
- Letter **D** is in the word but not at position 5 → possible positions 1‑4.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **ADEPT**:
- Positions: A(1) D(2) E(3) P(4) T(5)
- Contains A, D, P, and E in allowed spots.
- Introduces a new letter T, which is not ruled out.
Thus “ADEPT” is a valid next guess.
