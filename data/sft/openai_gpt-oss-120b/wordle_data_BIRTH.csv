### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, A, N, or E. The letter R is present but cannot be in the second position (its position in “CRANE”). For the next guess we should:

- Use five new letters that haven’t been ruled out to gather more information.
Choosing “FLIRT” gives us R in position 4 (allowed) and introduces the new letters F, L, I, and T, none of which have been excluded yet.

- Letters known NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, L, T, G, O.
- Remaining unknown positions (1, 4, 5) can use any letters not ruled out.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern ? I R ? ?. A good candidate that respects all constraints and introduces new letters is **VIRUS** (V I R U S).

This guess will test three new letters (V, U, S) while keeping I and R in their confirmed spots.

We have confirmed:
- I is correct in position 2.
- R is correct in position 3.
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N, E, F, L, T, G, O, V, U, S, plus previous non‑present letters.

So the secret word pattern is _ I R _ _. Remaining possible letters are those not yet eliminated: B, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need a common English word fitting that pattern. “MIRKY” (M I R K Y) uses only allowed letters (M, K, Y are new) and matches the pattern. It’s a regular word and introduces three new letters to test.

Thus the next guess should be MIRKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
