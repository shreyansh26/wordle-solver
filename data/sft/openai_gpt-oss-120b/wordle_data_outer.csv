### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, B, T, H, V.
- Remaining unknown letters occupy positions 1, 2, and 3, with one of them being O (at position 1 or 3).

A suitable word that fits the pattern _ _ _ E R, includes O at position 1, and uses only letters not eliminated is **OLDER** (O at position 1, L and D are new letters, E at 4, R at 5). This satisfies all constraints.

Thus the next guess should be:

We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:
- Position 1: O (confirmed from OLDER)
- Position 4: E (confirmed)
- Position 5: R (confirmed)
- Positions 2 and 3 are unknown letters, but they cannot be any of the letters that have been marked as not in the word: C, A, N, B, T, H, V, L, D.  
- The letter O is already used; we need two new letters that are allowed.

A common English word matching the pattern O _ _ E R and using only allowed letters is **OSIER** (a type of willow). It places S in position 2 and I in position 3, both of which have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess is OSIER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C, A, N are not in the word.

- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and introduces other letters to gather more info.

The word “BERTH” fits:
- Contains R (position 3) → not position 2.
- Contains E (position 2) → not position 5.
- No prohibited letters C, A, N.
- Introduces new letters B, T, H for further clues.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes R and E in allowed positions and uses none of the eliminated letters.  
""ROVER"" fits:
- R is at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed).
