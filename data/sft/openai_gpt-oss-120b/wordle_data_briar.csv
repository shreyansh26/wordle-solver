### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from the first guess:
- The secret word’s second letter is **R** (R was marked ✓).
- The letter **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked – in CRANE).
- Letters **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (marked x).

Thus the pattern is: _ R _ _ _ with an A somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5, and no C, N, or E.

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **ARROW**:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- Position 2 is R (✓ from both guesses).
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from both guesses). So A must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters C, N, E, O, W are not in the word.
- No definitive info about other letters, and we cannot assume a second R (the “-” could just indicate the existing R elsewhere).

We need a 5‑letter word with R as its second letter, containing an A at position 4 or 5, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **TRIAL** fits all constraints:
- T R I A L → R is second.
- A is fourth.
- No C, N, E, O, W appear.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

- **A** is not in positions 1‑3, confirming it belongs at position 4.
Thus the pattern is: _ R I A _.

Possible English words fitting that pattern and avoiding excluded letters include **FRIAR** and **BRIAR**. We need to test one of them to see which fits.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 2 = R (✓ on all guesses).
- Position 3 = I (✓ from guess 3 and 4).
- Position 4 = A (✓ from guess 3 and 4).
- Position 5 = R (✓ from guess 4).
- Position 1 is unknown, but we know letters that are not in the word: C, N, E, O, W, T, L, F, and also the first‑letter cannot be F (as F was marked x).
Thus the pattern is: _ R I A R.

The common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **BRIAR** (a prickly shrub). The first letter B has not been eliminated, so it is a valid next guess.
