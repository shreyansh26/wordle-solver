### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- S is correct at position 1.
- A is correct at position 4.
- R is in the word but not at positions 1,2,4,5 → must be position 3.
Thus the word pattern is **S _ R A _**.

Eliminated letters: C, N, E, I, L, T, O, U, G, plus any letters that received an ‘x’.
Remaining unused letters include P, Y, B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **SPRAY** (S‑P‑R‑A‑Y), using new letters P and Y that have not been ruled out.
