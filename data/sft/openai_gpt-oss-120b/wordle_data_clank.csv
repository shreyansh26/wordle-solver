### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that the secret word has:
- C in the 1st position (✓)
- A in the 3rd position (✓)
- N in the 4th position (✓)
- R and E are not in the word (x)

Thus the pattern is C _ A N _. We need a common word fitting this pattern without using R or E. ""CLANG"" fits: C L A N G.

- Position 2: L (✓)

The only unknown is position 5. Letters that are known not to be in the word are R, E, and G. We need a common English word of the form C L A N _. The word “CLANK” fits this pattern and uses K, which hasn't been ruled out.
