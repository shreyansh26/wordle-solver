### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined from previous feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 3 is E (✓ from guess 2).
- Letters R, A, I, H, L, F are not in the word.
- S is not at position 4 (from guess 1) and E is not at position 5 (from guess 1).

Thus the word pattern is: **S _ E _ _**, with the constraints:
- Position 2, 4, 5 cannot be any of the eliminated letters.
- Position 4 cannot be S; position 5 cannot be E.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **SPEND** (S P E N D). It fits the known positions and avoids all eliminated letters.

- Position 4 cannot be S (from earlier feedback)

So the pattern is **S _ E _ D** with the remaining letters for positions 2 and 4 coming from the alphabet excluding the eliminated letters. A common English word fitting this pattern and respecting all constraints is **SWEED** (S‑W‑E‑E‑D). It introduces a new letter W, repeats E (which is allowed), and places D correctly at the end.

Thus the next guess should be SWEED.

We have determined the known letters and positions:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: D (✓)

From previous guesses the letters that are NOT in the word are: R, A, I, H, L, F, P, N, W.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S _ E E D**, with the unknown second letter not among the excluded set. The common English word that matches this pattern and uses a permissible letter is **STEED** (S‑T‑E‑E‑D). The letter T has not been tried yet and is not on the excluded list.

Therefore the next guess should be STEED.
