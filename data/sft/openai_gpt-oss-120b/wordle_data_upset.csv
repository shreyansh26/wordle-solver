### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E in a position other than 5.
- Introduce new letters to test more possibilities.
A good candidate is “GELID”: it contains E at position 2, and uses letters G, L, I, D which have not been ruled out yet.

From the previous guesses we have determined:
- Letters C, R, A, N, G, L, I, D are not in the secret word.
- The letter E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both those spots).

Therefore E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
I need a new word that:
1. Contains E in one of those allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out yet.

Choosing **POETS** satisfies these conditions:
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- The other letters P, O, T, S have not been eliminated.
- POETS is a valid English word.

Thus this guess will test the remaining unknown letters while keeping E in a possible spot.
