### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE gave the following feedback:

- N is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked -).

So the secret word must contain N somewhere other than position 4, and cannot contain C, R, A, or E. I’ll pick a word that includes N in a different spot and avoids the eliminated letters. “UNZIP” fits: it uses N in the 2nd spot, and its other letters (U, Z, I, P) are all still possible.

We have two guesses with feedback:

1. CRANE → C x, R x, A x, N -, E x  
   => N is in the word, not in position 4. Letters C,R,A,E are not in the word.

2. UNZIP → U x, N -, Z x, I -, P x  
   => N is in the word, not in position 2 (and still not in position 4).  
   => I is in the word, not in position 4.  
   => Letters U,Z,P are not in the word.

So the secret word must contain **N** and **I**, with N not in positions 2 or 4, and I not in position 4. All other letters used must avoid the eliminated set {C,R,A,E,U,Z,P}.

We need a common 5‑letter word meeting those constraints. “MINTY” works:
- Contains I (position 2) and N (position 3), both allowed.
- Uses letters M, T, Y, none of which are eliminated.

Thus the next guess will be MINTY.
