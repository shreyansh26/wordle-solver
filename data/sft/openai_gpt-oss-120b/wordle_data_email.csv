### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and varied positions to give me useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a frequent opening guess in Wordle because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering several of the most common letters and giving a good spread of positions.

We know:
- Secret word pattern: __A__ (A is correct at position 3).
- Letters C, R, N are not in the word.
- Letter E is in the word but not at position 5 (and not at position 3).

We need a new guess that keeps A at the third position and tests other possible letters, especially placing E in a different slot (positions 1, 2, or 4). “BEAST” fits: B E A S T — A is third, E is at position 2 (different from previous wrong position), and it introduces new letters B, S, T while respecting the known exclusions.

Thus the next guess should be “BEAST”.

We have:
- Fixed letter: A is correct at position 3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, B, S, T (all got x).
- Letter E is in the word but not at positions 2 or 5.
Thus E can be at position 1 or 4.

We need a word of pattern _ _ A _ _. It must include E at position 1 or 4 and avoid the excluded letters if possible. A good candidate is **EMAIL**:
- Pattern: E (pos1) M (pos2) A (pos3) I (pos4) L (pos5)
- Contains E at position 1 (testing if E belongs there).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (M, I, L are fresh).
- Satisfies all known constraints.
