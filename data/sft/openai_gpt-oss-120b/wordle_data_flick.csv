### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the first guess:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains the letter C (to test its new position).
- Avoids R, A, N, E completely.
- Introduces other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SCOLD** (S‑C‑O‑L‑D). It places C in position 2 (different from position 1) and adds new letters S, O, L, D for testing.

From previous feedback:
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3,4,5.
- L is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1,2,3,5.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, D.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C and L in allowed slots and three other letters not excluded.  
""FLICK"" places L at position 2 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed), and adds F, I, K, which have not been ruled out.

Thus ""FLICK"" is a good next guess.
