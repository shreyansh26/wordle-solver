### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C and A, avoids R, N, E, places C somewhere other than the first slot, and places A somewhere other than the third slot.

The word **ACIDS** satisfies all these conditions:
- A is at position 1 (allowed)
- C is at position 2 (allowed)
- The remaining letters I, D, S have not been ruled out yet
- No prohibited letters (R, N, E) appear.

Thus ACIDS is a logical next guess.

We have two confirmed letters: A and C. Both are in the secret word but not in the positions they have appeared so far.

- From CRANE: C is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.
- From ACIDS: A is not in position 1, C is not in position 2.

Thus possible positions:
- A can be 2, 4, or 5 (not 1 or 3).
- C can be 3, 4, or 5 (not 1 or 2).

We need a valid 5‑letter word containing A and C placed in allowed slots and using none of the letters known to be absent (R, N, E, I, D, S).

The word **TACKY** fits:
- A is at position 2 (allowed),
- C is at position 3 (allowed),
- Remaining letters T, K, Y have not been ruled out.

Therefore TACKY is a logical next guess.

From the feedback we have deduced the exact positions of four letters:

- A is correct in position 2.
- C is correct in position 3.
- K is correct in position 4.
- Y is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern `_ A C K Y`.  
We have eliminated the letters R, N, E, I, D, S, T from the word.
