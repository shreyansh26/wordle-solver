### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich word to get information about the letters and their positions. “CRANE” contains two common consonants (C, R) and three of the most frequent letters (A, N, E). This should give useful feedback for the next guesses.

We know:
- Position 5 is E (confirmed).
- Letters C and N are not in the word.
- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
Thus the word pattern is _ _ _ _ E with R and A somewhere else (R ≠ position2, A ≠ position3).

A valid word satisfying these constraints is **RAISE**:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (allowed, only forbidden at position 3).
- I, S are filler letters not yet ruled out.
- E is at position 5 as required.
This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while keeping known constraints.

We have determined the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 3 is I (I✓).
- Position 5 is E (E✓).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be in position 1 or 4. Since R occupies position 4, A must be in position 1.
- Letters C, N, S are not in the word.

The pattern is therefore **A _ I R E**. A common English word that fits this pattern is **AFIRE**.

This guess respects all known constraints and introduces a new letter (F) to test further.
