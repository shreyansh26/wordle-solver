### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters **S, L, A, R, I** are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letter **D** is correct and fixed at position 5 (✓).
- Letters **T** and **E** are in the word but are not in the positions they have occupied so far:
  * T was in position 4 in “SLATE” and position 1 in “TRIED”, so T cannot be 1 or 4. It must be at position 2 or 3.
  * E was in position 5 in “SLATE” and position 4 in “TRIED”, so E cannot be 4 or 5. It must be at position 1, 2, or 3 (but not where T already sits).

Thus the secret word has the form:

```
_ _ _ _ D
```

with **T** at position 2 or 3, **E** at position 1‑3 (but not where T is), and the remaining two letters are still unknown (and must avoid S, L, A, R, I).

To gather more information we should guess a word that:
- Keeps D in position 5,
- Places T and E in new positions respecting the above restrictions,
- Introduces two fresh letters to test.

A suitable candidate is **BETED**:
- B (new)
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- T at position 3 (allowed)
- E again at position 4 (we know E cannot be 4, so this will give an “x” and confirm the rule)
- D at position 5 (already known correct)

This guess follows all constraints and will provide feedback on the new letters B and the second E placement.

Guess 2: TRIED -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(-) E(-) D(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters **S, L, A, R, I** are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letter **D** is correct and fixed at position 5 (✓).
- Letters **T** and **E** are in the word but are not in the positions they have occupied so far:
  * T was in position 4 in “SLATE” and position 1 in “TRIED”, so T cannot be 1 or 4. It must be at position 2 or 3.
  * E was in position 5 in “SLATE” and position 4 in “TRIED”, so E cannot be 4 or 5. It must be at position 1, 2, or 3 (but not where T already sits).

Thus the secret word has the form:

```
_ _ _ _ D
```

with **T** at position 2 or 3, **E** at position 1‑3 (but not where T is), and the remaining two letters are still unknown (and must avoid S, L, A, R, I).

To gather more information we should guess a word that:
- Keeps D in position 5,
- Places T and E in new positions respecting the above restrictions,
- Introduces two fresh letters to test.

A suitable candidate is **BETED**:
- B (new)
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- T at position 3 (allowed)
- E again at position 4 (we know E cannot be 4, so this will give an “x” and confirm the rule)
- D at position 5 (already known correct)

This guess follows all constraints and will provide feedback on the new letters B and the second E placement.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
