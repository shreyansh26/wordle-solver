### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that the secret word does NOT contain S, A, E, W, I, R.  
It DOES contain L and T, but:
- L is NOT in position 2 or 5.
- T is NOT in position 1 or 4.

Therefore L can be in positions 1, 3, or 4, and T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

To gather more information, I’ll make a guess that places L in a permissible position (position 1) and introduces completely new letters that have not yet been ruled out. This will also let us test additional letters while respecting the known constraints.

The word **LUNCH** fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- No T is present (we already know T is in the word, so this guess will confirm its absence in this word and keep the constraint information intact).
- The other letters U, N, C, H have not been tested and are not among the excluded letters.

We have identified that the secret word must contain the letters L, T, and U (each marked with “-” in prior feedback).  
Constraints from previous guesses:
- L is NOT in positions 1, 2, 5 → L can be 3 or 4.  
- T is NOT in positions 1, 4 → T can be 2, 3, 5.  
- U is NOT in position 2 → U can be 1, 3, 4, 5.  

All letters marked “x” are eliminated: S, A, E, W, I, R, N, C, H.

We need a new word that keeps L, T, U in allowed spots while testing other possible letters.  
“BLUNT” contains L, U, and T and also adds the new letter B (still unknown).  
Positions in “BLUNT”: B 1, L 2, U 3, N 4, T 5.  
- L at position 2 is known to be wrong → will get “-”.  
- U at position 3 is allowed → will get “-”.  
- T at position 5 is a possible correct spot → could be “✓”.  
- N is already known to be absent → will get “x”.  
- B will tell us whether B is in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes L and T in different positions, avoids S, A, and E, and tests new letters. “TWIRL” fits:
- T at position 1 (allowed, not position 4)
- L at position 5 (allowed, not position 2)
- Uses new letters W, I, R which haven’t been tested yet.
Thus, the next guess is TWIRL.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed that the secret word does NOT contain S, A, E, W, I, R.  
It DOES contain L and T, but:
- L is NOT in position 2 or 5.
- T is NOT in position 1 or 4.

Therefore L can be in positions 1, 3, or 4, and T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

To gather more information, I’ll make a guess that places L in a permissible position (position 1) and introduces completely new letters that have not yet been ruled out. This will also let us test additional letters while respecting the known constraints.

The word **LUNCH** fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- No T is present (we already know T is in the word, so this guess will confirm its absence in this word and keep the constraint information intact).
- The other letters U, N, C, H have not been tested and are not among the excluded letters.

Thus the next guess is LUNCH.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have identified that the secret word must contain the letters L, T, and U (each marked with “-” in prior feedback).  
Constraints from previous guesses:

- T is NOT in positions 1, 4 → T can be 2, 3, 5.  
- U is NOT in position 2 → U can be 1, 3, 4, 5.  

All letters marked “x” are eliminated: S, A, E, W, I, R, N, C, H.

We need a new word that keeps L, T, U in allowed spots while testing other possible letters.  
“BLUNT” contains L, U, and T and also adds the new letter B (still unknown).  
Positions in “BLUNT”: B 1, L 2, U 3, N 4, T 5.  
- L at position 2 is known to be wrong → will get “-”.  
- U at position 3 is allowed → will get “-”.  
- T at position 5 is a possible correct spot → could be “✓”.  
- N is already known to be absent → will get “x”.  
- B will tell us whether B is in the word.

Thus “BLUNT” is a good diagnostic guess.

We have determined the pattern of the secret word based on the feedback:

- The letters **U** (position 3) and **T** (position 5) are confirmed correct.
- The letter **L** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5, so it must be at position 4.
- The letters **S, A, E, W, I, R, N, C, H, B** are all excluded.

Thus the word must fit the pattern **_ _ U L T**.  
The common English word that matches this pattern is **ADULT** (A D U L T). Although the feedback previously marked **A** as “not in the word”, it is the only viable solution that satisfies all positional constraints, and testing it will confirm whether the earlier feedback contained an error.

Therefore, the next guess is ADULT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
