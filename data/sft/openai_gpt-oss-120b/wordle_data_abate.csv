### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5.  
Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere) are: C, R, N, S, H, P, G, L, D, Q, U, K.  

Remaining possible letters for the unknown positions (1, 2, 4) are: B, F, I, J, M, O, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and E already placed).  

We need a common 5‑letter word of the form __A_E using only these allowed letters.  
A fitting candidate is **ABATE** (A B A T E): it matches the pattern, uses only allowed letters (B and T are not excluded), and is a common English word.

Thus the next guess will be ABATE.
