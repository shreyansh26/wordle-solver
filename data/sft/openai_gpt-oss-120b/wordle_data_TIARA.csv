### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from feedback:
- The third letter is A (✓).
- The letter T is in the word but not in position 4 (‑), so T must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Letters S, L, and E are not in the word (x).

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the third spot, containing T in a different position, and avoiding S, L, E.

“TRAMP” fits:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (matches the ✓).
- No S, L, or E appear.

Thus “TRAMP” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From Guess 1 (SLATE): A is correct in position 3; T is in the word but not in position 4; S, L, and E are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (TRAMP): T is correct in position 1; R is in the word but not in position 2; A is again correct in position 3; M and P are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 1 = T
- Position 3 = A
- R is somewhere other than position 2 (so position 4 or 5)
- The letters S, L, E, M, P are definitely absent.

We need a valid English word fitting the pattern **T _ A _ _** that contains an R in position 4 or 5 and avoids the excluded letters. “TIARA” (T I A R A) satisfies all constraints: T at 1, A at 3, R at 4, and uses only allowed letters (I and a second A, which have not been disproven). It is a common English word, so it makes a good next guess.
