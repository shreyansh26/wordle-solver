### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess SLATE we have:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L and E are not in the word.
- A and T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (A not in position 3, T not in position 4).

So the secret word starts with **S**.  
A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
We need a new word that respects these constraints and avoids L and E.

A good candidate is **SUTRA**:
- S stays in position 1.
- T moves to position 3 (allowed).
- A moves to position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces U and R as new letters to test.

Thus the next guess is “SUTRA”.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (SLATE): S is correct in position 1; L and E are not in the word; A and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- From guess 2 (SUTRA): S is still correct in position 1; U, T and A are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in that guess; R is not in the word.

Summarising the constraints:
- Position 1 = **S**
- **A** cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions 2 or 4
- **T** cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions 2 or 5
- **U** cannot be in position 2 → possible positions 3, 4 or 5
- Letters **L, E, R** are excluded.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses the required letters is **S Q U A T**:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- Q is a new letter (allowed)
- U is in position 3 (U is not allowed in position 2, so this is fine)
- A is in position 4 (A is not allowed in 3 or 5)
- T is in position 5 (T is not allowed in 3 or 4)

Thus “SQUAT” matches every piece of feedback.
