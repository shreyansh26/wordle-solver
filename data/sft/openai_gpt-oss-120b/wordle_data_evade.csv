### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that:
- Position 3 is A (✓)
- Position 5 is E (✓)
- Letters C, R, N are not in the word at all (x)

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ A _ E, using only letters that are not C, R, or N.

I need a common 5‑letter word matching that pattern. “GLADE” fits perfectly:
- G in position 1
- L in position 2
- A in position 3 (already confirmed)
- D in position 4
- E in position 5 (already confirmed)

All letters are allowed, so I’ll guess GLADE.
