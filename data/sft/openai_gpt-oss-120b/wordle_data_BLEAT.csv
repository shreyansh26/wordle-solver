### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position2 = L (from PLEAD ✓)
- Position3 = E (✓)
- Position4 = A (✓)

Excluded letters: C, R, N, P, D (from x feedback). Also from first guess, C,R,N not in word; from second guess, P and D not in word.

Thus the word pattern is _ L E A _. Need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not excluded and that make a valid English word. ""BLEAT"" (B L E A T) fits the pattern and uses new letters B and T, which haven't been ruled out. It's a common 5‑letter word, so it's a good next guess.
