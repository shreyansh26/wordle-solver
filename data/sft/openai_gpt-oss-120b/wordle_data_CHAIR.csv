### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial five‑letter guess. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and vowels to get useful information on the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

From the feedback:
- C is correct at position 1.
- A is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at position 2, so it must be at position 4 or 5.
- N and E are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is C _ A _ _. I need a word that keeps C in the first spot, A in the third, places R in either the fourth or fifth position, and introduces new letters to test. “CLARK” fits: C (pos1) ✓, L (new), A (pos3) ✓, R (pos4) – good placement for R, K (new). No prohibited letters (N, E). This will give more information.

We have confirmed letters:
- C is correct at position 1.
- A is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4, so it must be at position 5.

Letters N, E, L, K are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is **C _ A _ R**.  
A valid English word fitting this pattern and not using any excluded letters is **CHAIR** (C‑H‑A‑I‑R). It places new letters H and I in the unknown slots, keeping R at position 5 as required.

Therefore the next guess should be “CHAIR”.
