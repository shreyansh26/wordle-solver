### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter English word that contains a mix of common letters and a few less frequent ones to get useful information about the secret word. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give a balanced spread of letters for the first feedback.

We have S at position 4 and T at position 5 confirmed (✓).  
Feedback from TWIST:  
- T at position 1 got “-”, meaning T is in the word but not at position 1 (we already know it’s at position 5).  
- I at position 3 got “-”, so I is in the word but not at position 3.  
All letters marked “x” are not in the word: L, A, E, C, R, U, G, H, O, W.  

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ _ S T, contains the letter I (not in position 3), and contains no excluded letters.  

A common English word that matches these constraints is **MIDST** (M I D S T):
- Position 2 is I (satisfying the required I, not at position 3).
- Positions 4 and 5 are S and T as already known.
- Letters M and D have not been ruled out.

Therefore, “MIDST” is a logical next guess.
