""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it tests C, R, A, N, and E, covering common consonants and vowels. This will give me useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the first guess CRANE I learned:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next guess must contain A in a different position and avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll try a common word that places A at the start and introduces new letters.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, N, E, L, O, D are not in the word.
- U is correct at position 4.
- A is in the word but not at positions 1, 3, or 4, so A must be at position 2 or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with U in the fourth spot and A at position 2 or 5, using only allowed letters (A, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
