### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1: L (✓)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: unknown, cannot be F or T (both marked x) and cannot be any letters previously eliminated (C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I).
- Position 4: unknown, also cannot be F or T or any eliminated letters.
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Thus the word is **L O _ _ Y**.

Possible valid English words fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters include:
- LOWLY (L O W L Y) – introduces new letter W and repeats L.
- LOGGY (L O G G Y) – introduces new letter G and repeats G.

Choosing **LOWLY** tests a new letter (W) while still respecting all known constraints. If the secret word is LOWLY we will solve it; otherwise the feedback will further narrow down the remaining possibilities.
