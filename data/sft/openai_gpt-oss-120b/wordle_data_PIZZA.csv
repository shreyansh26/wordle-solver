### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter A is in the word but not in position 3. For the next guess we should include A in a different position and avoid using the eliminated letters. A good choice is BALMY, which places A at position 2 and introduces new letters B, L, M, Y to gather more information.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, N, E, B, L, M, Y are not in the word.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
Thus A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need a word that places A in a new position and introduces fresh letters. Choosing A in position 1 gives the pattern A‑‑‑‑. A common word fitting this and using only letters not yet ruled out is **ADIOS** (A D I O S). This will test four new letters (D, I, O, S) while keeping A at a permissible position.

Thus the secret word contains **A** (pos 4 or 5) and **I** (pos 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3).  
We need a new guess that keeps A in a possible spot and places I somewhere other than position 3, while also introducing fresh letters to discover the remaining unknowns.

A good candidate is **VITAL**:
- A is at position 4 (still allowed).
- I is at position 2 (allowed and not position 3).
- The guess adds the new letters **V** and **T**, giving more information.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letters A and I.  
- I is confirmed at position 2 (from VITAL).  
- A cannot be at positions 1‑4 and must be at position 5.  

So the word pattern is: _ I _ _ A.

All letters that have been shown not to be in the word are: B, C, D, E, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, V, Y, plus any repeats of those. Remaining possible letters include: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Z, etc.

A common 5‑letter word fitting the pattern _ I _ _ A and using only unused letters is **PIZZA** (P I Z Z A). This introduces new letters P and Z while keeping I in position 2 and A in position 5.

Thus the next guess is:
