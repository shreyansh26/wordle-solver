### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.

Thus the secret word must contain the letter A somewhere other than position 3, and must avoid C, R, N, E entirely. I need a new 5‑letter word that includes A (not at position 3) and none of the excluded letters. “AMISS” fits: it has A in position 1 and uses only letters M, I, S which are still possible. This will give more information about the remaining letters.

We know the secret word is 5 letters. From the feedback:
- Position 1 is A (A✓).
- Position 2 is M (M✓).
- Letters C, R, N, E, I, S are not in the word.
- A is already placed, and M is placed; the remaining three letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the eliminated letters and also cannot be A or M again unless the word allows duplicates (but we have no evidence for duplicates).

We need a common word that fits the pattern **A M _ _ _** using only allowable letters. “AMPLE” is invalid because it contains E. “AMEND” contains N and E. “AMUSE” contains S and E. “AMBER” contains E and R. “AMPLY” uses P, L, Y, none of which have been eliminated, so it is a valid candidate.

Thus the next guess will be **AMPLY**.
