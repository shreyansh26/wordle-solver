### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, G, H, T, I, B, O, X.
- N is confirmed to be in the word and, from the feedback on INBOX, N is correct at position 2.

Thus the secret word must have the form **? N ? ? ?** where the other letters cannot be any of the excluded ones.

Allowed letters (so far) include: D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

- U is not in position 3 (feedback “U(-)” in SNUFF) → can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters (cannot appear): C, R, A, E, G, H, T, B, O, X, S, F, plus any duplicates of these.
- Allowed letters for the remaining slots: D, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and N which can repeat).

The word **UNPIN** fits:
- U at position 1 (allowed for U),

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- I is not in position 2 (from NIGHT). So I can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5‑letter word using N and I, respecting those position constraints, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is **INBOX**:
- I is at position 1 (allowed).
- N is at position 2 (allowed; N is not at 1 or 4).

- Remaining possible letters for position 3 are those not excluded and not already used (U, N, I, P). Viable candidates include D, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

- The pattern **U N _ I P** suggests the common English word **UNZIP** (with Z in the third slot). “Z” has not been excluded and makes a valid word.
