### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G.  
From the second guess MIGHT we learned:
- H is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5.
All other letters in MIGHT (M, I, G) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word contains H and T (in other positions) and none of the eliminated letters.  
Choosing a word that includes H and T in allowed spots will give more information while using only letters still possible.

The word **SHUTS** uses H (position 2) and T (position 4), both safe positions, and uses only allowed letters (S, H, U, T). It also introduces new letters S and U to test further.

“HOOTY” fits: H O O T Y → H at position 1, T at position 4, and introduces O and Y for further clues. All letters are allowed (none of the eliminated letters appear).

So the next guess is “HOOTY”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): all letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (MIGHT): M, I, G are not in the word; H is in the word but not in position 2; T is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 3 (SHUTS): S, U are not in the word; H is still not in position 2; T is correct at position 4.
- Guess 4 (HOOTY): H is in the word but not in position 1; O is correct at positions 2 and 3; T is correct at position 4; Y is not in the word.

Thus the current pattern is:

_ O O T _

The only letters we know are O (positions 2‑3), T (position 4), and H (somewhere else). Since H cannot be in positions 1‑4, it must be position 5. Hence the secret word must be:

_ O O T H

We need a valid English word fitting that pattern using only letters not yet eliminated. The letter B has not been ruled out, and “BOOTH” matches the pattern perfectly.

Therefore the next guess should be **BOOTH**.
