### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but in different spots than guessed.
  • A is not in position 3.
  • N is not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N, excludes C, R, E, and respects the position constraints.  
“MANGO” satisfies all conditions:
- Contains A (position 2, not 3) and N (position 3, not 4).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (M, G, O are new and allowed).

Thus “MANGO” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word's first four letters are M A N G based on the second guess (MANGO) which gave all four letters as correct in their positions. The only unknown is the fifth letter. It cannot be O (ruled out), nor C, R, E from the first guess. Any other letter could fit, and a common English word with the pattern M A N G _ is ""MANGY"". This uses a new letter Y, which hasn't been ruled out, and forms a valid word.
