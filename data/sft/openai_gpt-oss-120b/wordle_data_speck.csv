### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C(-) means C is in the word but not position 1; R, A, N are not in the word; E(-) means E is in the word but not position 5.
- From guess 2 (EPOCH): E(-) means E is in the word but not position 1; P(✓) means P is correct at position 2; O(x) not in word; C(✓) means C is correct at position 4; H(x) not in word.

Combine:
- C must be at position 4 (and not at 1, satisfied).
- P is fixed at position 2.
- E is in the word, not at positions 1 or 5, and cannot be position 4 (occupied by C). So E must be at position 3.
Thus the pattern is _ P E C _.

Letters known not to be in the word: R, A, N, O, H.
We need a common 5‑letter word matching ?PE C ?. “SPECK” fits perfectly: S P E C K, uses allowed letters and satisfies the pattern.

Thus the next guess should be SPECK.
