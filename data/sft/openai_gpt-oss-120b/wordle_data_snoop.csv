### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that C, R, A, E are not in the secret word. N is in the word but not in position 4, so N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. I need a new guess that includes N in one of those allowed positions and avoids using C, R, A, E. A good candidate is ""BISON"": it contains N at position 5 (allowed), and the other letters B, I, S, O are not among the excluded letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- O is correct at position 4 (from BISON feedback).
- N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be in positions 1‑3.
- S is in the word but cannot be in position 3 (from BISON feedback where S was at position 3 and got “-”).

Excluded letters: A, B, C, E, I, R (all marked ‘x’).

We need a new word that:
- Has O at position 4.
- Contains N somewhere in positions 1‑3.
- Contains S somewhere except position 3.
- Uses none of the excluded letters.

The word **SNOOP** fits:
- S (position 1) – allowed.
- N (position 2) – allowed (still a possible spot for N).
- O (position 3) – a repeat of O, which is okay.
- O (position 4) – matches the confirmed O.
- P (position 5) – a new letter not yet excluded.

This guess will test N’s exact spot, confirm S’s location, and check if a second O exists.
