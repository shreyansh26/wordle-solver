### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good common starter word is “SLATE” because it contains frequently used letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. This will give us useful feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first guess that the secret word does NOT contain S, L, A, or E anywhere, and that the letter T is correct and fixed in the fourth position. Therefore the pattern is _ _ _ T _. We need a valid English word that fits this pattern and avoids the prohibited letters. “WROTH” (meaning angry) matches: W R O T H, with T at the fourth slot and none of the forbidden letters.
