### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have established:
- Position 3 = I (✓)
- Position 4 = L (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)
- From UTILE feedback: U(-) means U is in the word but not at position 1, so it must be at position 2 (the only remaining slot). Thus position 2 = U.
- T is not in the word (x).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ U I L E.

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching this pattern, using a letter not yet ruled out for position 1. The word “GUILE” fits perfectly: G U I L E, with G not previously excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be GUILE.
