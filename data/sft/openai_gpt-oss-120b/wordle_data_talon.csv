### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N in different positions, avoids C, R, and E, and introduces fresh letters to gather more information. “MANGO” satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A (position 2) and N (position 3), both not in the forbidden spots.
- Uses new letters M, G, O to test additional possibilities.
- No prohibited letters are present.

Thus “MANGO” is a good next guess.
