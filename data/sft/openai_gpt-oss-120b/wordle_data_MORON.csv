### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R and N, but they are not in the positions they were guessed (R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4). The letters C, A, and E are not in the word at all. 

To get more information, I need a new guess that:
- Includes R and N in different positions (avoiding their previous wrong spots).
- Introduces three new letters to test.
- Does not reuse the eliminated letters C, A, or E.

A good candidate is **RINGO**:

- New letters I, G, O are introduced for testing.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R and N, but they are not in the positions they were guessed (R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4). The letters C, A, and E are not in the word at all. 

To get more information, I need a new guess that:
- Includes R and N in different positions (avoiding their previous wrong spots).
- Introduces three new letters to test.
- Does not reuse the eliminated letters C, A, or E.

A good candidate is **RINGO**:
- R is moved to position 1 (allowed).
- N is moved to position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- New letters I, G, O are introduced for testing.
- No C, A, or E are present.

Thus, I will guess “RINGO”.

Guess 2: RINGO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) N(-) G(x) O(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have discovered that only the letters R and N are in the secret word so far. Their prohibited positions are:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from guesses CRANE and RINGO)
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from the same feedback)

Thus:
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5

We need a valid English word that includes both R and N in allowable spots while introducing new letters to test. The word **SPURN** fits perfectly:
- S P U R N
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- N is in position 5 (allowed)
- None of the letters C, A, E, I, G, O (already known to be absent) appear.

This guess will confirm whether R is at 4 and N at 5 and also test the new letters S, P, U.

- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 → R must be in position 3.
- N is in the word and is correct at position 5.
- O is in the word (feedback “-“) but was guessed in position 5, so O cannot be in position 5; it can be in positions 1‑4, and since position 3 is already R, O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- All letters marked “x” are not in the word: C, A, E, I, G, S, P, U.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ R _ N that contains an O in one of the remaining spots and uses only letters not ruled out. The word **BORON** fits:
- B O R O N → R is third, N is fifth, O appears (not in position 5), and no excluded letters are used.

Thus the next guess should be “BORON”.
