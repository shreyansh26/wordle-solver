### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains the letters R and E.

From previous guesses:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (crane) or 4 (query). So R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 5 (crane) or 3 (query). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

We need a new word that places R and E in allowed slots and introduces other unused letters to gather more info, while avoiding letters known to be absent (C, A, N, Q, U, Y, plus any others from feedback).

Choosing R at position 1 and E at position 4 satisfies the constraints. Adding three new letters O, T, S (none are excluded) gives the valid English word “rotes”.

Thus the next guess is:
