### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that will give useful information about the secret word.

We need a word containing the letters I, N, and E (each marked with “-” meaning they are present but not in the guessed positions).  
Constraints from previous guesses:
- N is not in position 2 or 4 (was wrong in positions 4 and 2).  
- E is not in position 4 or 5 (was wrong in positions 5 and 4).  
- I is not in position 1 (was wrong in position 1).  

All other letters used so far (C, R, A, L, T) are known to be absent.

Looking for a common 5‑letter word that respects these position restrictions and avoids the excluded letters.  
The word **DEIGN** fits perfectly:
- Positions: D 1, E 2, I 3, G 4, N 5  
- E is not in 4 or 5, I is not in 1, N is not in 2 or 4.  
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus DEIGN is a valid next guess.

2. **INLET** → I, N, E are present but in wrong spots; L, T, and also I (position 1) are absent.
3. **DEIGN** → D is absent; E, I, G are correct and in the right positions (positions 2‑4); N is present but in the wrong spot (position 5 is wrong).

From these clues:

- Position 3 = **I** (✓)
- Position 4 = **G** (✓)
- N cannot be in positions 2,4,5 (from earlier feedback) and also not position 5 (from DEIGN). The only remaining slot for N is position 1.
- The only unknown letter is position 5, which must be a letter not ruled out (not C, R, A, L, T, D, etc.).
