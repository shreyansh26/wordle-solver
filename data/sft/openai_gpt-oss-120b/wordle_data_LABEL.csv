### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, P, D.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  * A: not in position 3 (from “CRANE”) and not in position 4 (from “PLEAD”). So A can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
  * E: not in position 5 (from “CRANE”) and not in position 3 (from “PLEAD”). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
  * L: not in position 2 (from “PLEAD”). So L can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a five‑letter word that includes A, E, and L, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the excluded letters.  
The word **VALET** fits perfectly:

- V A L E T
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L is in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus VALET is a legal next guess.
