### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new word that:
1. Contains both R and E.
2. Places R somewhere other than the 2nd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot.
3 – 5. Introduces new letters to test other possibilities while avoiding C, A, N.

The word **BERTH** satisfies these conditions:
- B E R T H contains R (position 3) and E (position 2), both different from the forbidden spots.
- It adds the fresh letters B, T, and H for further information.
- It does not contain any of the eliminated letters C, A, or N.
Thus it is a logical second guess.
