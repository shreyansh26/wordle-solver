### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good opener because it tests two frequent vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful feedback for the next guesses.

Based on the feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

I need a 5‑letter word that includes A (not in position 3) and avoids C, R, N, E. I’ll also try new letters to gather more info. “BALMY” fits: it contains A in position 2 and uses only letters B, L, M, Y which haven’t been ruled out.

We have deduced the known positions:
- Position 1: B (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 5: Y (correct)

Positions 3 and 4 cannot be L, M, C, R, N, E. They can be any other letters not yet disproved. A common English word fitting the pattern B A _ _ Y is **BAGGY** (B A G G Y). G has not been ruled out, and using it twice tests both positions.
