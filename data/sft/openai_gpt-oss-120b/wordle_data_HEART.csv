### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes a vowel and several frequent consonants, which should give useful feedback for the next steps.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must have the pattern _ _ A _ _, must contain R and E (with R not in slot 2 and E not in slot 5), and must avoid C and N.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **PEARL**:
- P E A R L → A is in position 3.
- R is in position 4 (not 2).
- E is in position 2 (not 5).
- No C or N present.

Thus PEARL is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- Positions 2,3,4 are locked as E, A, R respectively.
- Letters excluded: C, N, P, L.
- Unknown letters for positions 1 and 5 must be from the remaining alphabet and not be any excluded letters.

Possible words fitting the pattern _ E A R _ include:
- HEARD
- HEARS
- DEARY
- BEARS
- REARM (but R already used in position 4, and would repeat R)

Choosing ""HEARD"" introduces two new letters (H and D) to test the remaining possibilities.
