### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (the fourth slot of CRANE). Therefore our next guess must include N somewhere other than the fourth position and must avoid C, R, A, E entirely.

A good candidate is **UNION**:

- It uses only letters U, N, I, O that have not been ruled out.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have deduced:
- Position 2 is N (green from UNION and KNOLL).
- Position 3 is O (green from KNOLL).
- Letters C, R, A, E, U, I, K, L are not in the word.
- O cannot be in position 4 (from UNION’s O‑sign), and N is not in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and UNION).
Thus the word fits the pattern _ N O _ _. We need a valid word using only currently unknown letters for the remaining spots. “SNOGS” (S N O G S) satisfies all constraints: S and G have not been ruled out, positions 1,4,5 are allowed, and the fixed N and O are correct.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 1: **S** (green)
- Position 2: **N** (green)
- Position 3: **O** (green)
- Position 4 cannot be **O** (the O from UNION was marked “-” in position 4) and cannot be any letter that has been marked “x”: C, R, A, E, U, I, K, L, G.
- Position 5 cannot be **S** (the second S in SNOGS was marked “-”), and likewise cannot be any of the “x” letters.

All letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, U, I, K, L, G.  
Letters known to be in the word: S, N, O (already placed).  

We need a valid English word of the form **S N O _ _** using only letters that have not been excluded.  
A common word fitting this pattern and respecting the constraints is **SNOWY** (S N O W Y).  
- W and Y have not been tried yet, so they are permissible.  
- Position 4 is W (not O, not an excluded letter).  
- Position 5 is Y (not S, not an excluded letter).

Thus the next guess should be **SNOWY**.
