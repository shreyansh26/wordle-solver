I need to start the Wordle-like game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess uses common letters and varied positions to gather information. “CRANE” contains frequently used letters C, R, A, N, E and spreads them across the word, which should give useful feedback.

We know from the first guess:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E, avoids C, R, N, and places A and E in different positions than those ruled out. “BLEAT” fits: it contains A (position 4) and E (position 3), and uses no forbidden letters.

We have confirmed:
- E is definitely in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, so it can be 1, 2, or 5.
- T is in the word but not in positions 5 or 3, so it can be 1, 2, or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, B, L.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ _ E _ _, containing A and T in the allowed spots and using no excluded letters.

The word **THETA** fits perfectly:
- Pattern T H E T A → E is at position 3.
- A is at position 5 (allowed).
- T appears at positions 1 and 4 (both allowed).
- No forbidden letters are present.

Thus the next guess should be THETA.
