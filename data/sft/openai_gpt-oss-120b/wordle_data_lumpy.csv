### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, A, T, E are not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

So the new guess must contain L in a different position and avoid S, A, T, E. I’ll try “WORLD”, which places L at position 4 and introduces new letters W, O, R, D.

We know only the letter L is in the secret word. From the two guesses:

Thus L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

We need a new word containing L in one of the allowed positions and only using letters that have not been eliminated. Choose a common word with L at the first position to keep it simple and introduce new letters.

Word candidate: **LUNCH**
- L is in position 1 (allowed).
