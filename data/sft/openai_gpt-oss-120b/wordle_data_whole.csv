### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback, letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all, and E is correct in the fifth position. So the secret word ends with ""E"" and cannot contain C, R, A, N anywhere.

We have confirmed:
- E is correct at position 5.
- L is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3.

Therefore L must be at position 1 or 4.

All letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, I, D, B, U, G, (and also L is known to be present).  
Allowed letters for the remaining spots include: F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A good candidate that ends with E, places L at position 4, and uses only allowed letters is **WHOLE** (W H O L E). This will test L at the fourth spot and introduce new letters W, H, O.

So the next guess is WHOLE.
