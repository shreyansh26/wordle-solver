### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback on the first guess:
- The letter A is correct and in the correct position (third slot).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern **__A__**, and cannot contain C, R, N, or E.

We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern and avoiding the forbidden letters. “GLASS” fits: G L A S S. It respects the pattern, and none of its letters are among the excluded ones.

We have the pattern __A__ with A fixed at position 3. From the second guess we learned:

- There is another S elsewhere, but not at position 5 (‑). So the extra S must be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters G, L, C, R, N, E are not in the word.

- Forbidden letters: C,R,N,E,G,L,W,H (from x feedback). Also S only allowed at position4.
Thus pattern is _ _ A S _. Remaining possible letters are those not yet excluded: B, D, F, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a common English word fitting __AS_. ""TOAST"" (T O A S T) matches: T and O are allowed, third A, fourth S, fifth T (no restriction on T). No forbidden letters appear. Hence ""TOAST"" is a good next guess.

We have determined the confirmed letters from feedback:
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: S (✓)
- Position 5: T (✓)

The first T in the previous guess got a “(-)”, meaning the letter T is in the word but not at position 1, which is satisfied by having T at position 5.

All letters marked “x” are not in the secret word: C, R, N, E, G, L, W, H, plus any other letters from earlier guesses that received an “x”.  
Thus the only remaining possible letters for position 1 are those not yet excluded (e.g., B, D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z).

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ O A S T** and uses an allowed first letter is **BOAST**.

This satisfies all known constraints, so it is the logical next guess.
