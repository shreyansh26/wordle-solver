### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that covers a variety of frequent letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it contains both common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), giving useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1, so C must be in position 2‑4.
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word has pattern _ _ _ _ E with a C somewhere in positions 2‑4. I need a new word ending with E, containing C not at the start, and avoiding R, A, N. “SLICE” fits: S L I C E (C in position 4, E in position 5, no forbidden letters). This will test the remaining unknown letters.

We have determined from the feedback:
- Letter C is correct at position 4.
- Letter E is correct at position 5.
- Letters R, A, N, S, L, I are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern ___CE, using only letters that are not excluded. A common English word that matches this pattern is **DEUCE** (D‑E‑U‑C‑E). It contains no prohibited letters and places C and E in the required positions.
