### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C and R are not in the secret word.
- Letters A, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in “CRANE”: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

Thus the new guess must include A, N, and E, avoid C and R, and place those three letters in different positions from the ones prohibited. A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is “ANNEX”:
- A is in position 1 (allowed),
- N is in positions 2 and 3 (allowed, not position 4),
- E is in position 4 (allowed, not position 5),
- No C or R appears.

Therefore, “ANNEX” is a valid next guess.

We have feedback:

- From CRANE: C and R are not in the word. A, N, E are present but not in positions 3,4,5 respectively.
- From ANNEX: X is not in the word. A, N, E are present but not in positions 1,2,3,4 respectively (A not 1, N not 2 or 3, E not 4). Combined constraints:
  * A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  * N cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (so N must be in position 1 or 5).
  * E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
  * No C, R, X.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses A, N, E plus two other letters is **BEGAN**:
  - B (pos1) is allowed.
  - E (pos2) is allowed (E not 4/5).
  - G (pos3) is allowed (no restriction).
  - A (pos4) is allowed (A not 1/3).
  - N (pos5) is allowed (N not 2/3/4).

All letters are valid, and the word is common.
