### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word‑guessing game with an initial 5‑letter guess. Since there is no prior information, a common starter word that covers a variety of common letters is a good choice. ""CRANE"" contains two frequently used consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), which should give useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

- Position 5 is E (from ✓).
- Letters C, A, N are not in the word at all (x).

We have confirmed letters:
- R is correct at position 2.
- E is correct at position 5.
- B is in the word but not in position 1 (from guess “BRUTE” gave B(-)). So B must be in position 3 or 4.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, T (all marked x).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ R _ _ E with B at position 3 or 4, using only letters not eliminated. “PROBE” fits perfectly:
- P (new), R (position 2), O (new), B (position 4), E (position 5).
All letters are allowed, and it tests new letters P and O while placing B correctly.
Thus “PROBE” is a logical next guess.
