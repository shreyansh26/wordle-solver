### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have deduced the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: A (confirmed)
- Position 5: L (confirmed)
- Position 4: U (confirmed)
- Letter F is in the word but not in position 3, leaving position 2 as the only spot; thus position 2 = F.
The remaining unknown is position 3. Excluded letters so far: S, T, E, R, P, H, N, V, I, W. The word must be a valid English word of the form A F _ U L. The word ""AFOUL"" fits perfectly, using O (not yet excluded) at position 3. Therefore the next guess should be ""AFOUL"".
