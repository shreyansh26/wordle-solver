### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, O, M, P are all NOT in the word.
- Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (the second slot of ""STOMP"").

So we need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains the letter T (anywhere except the second position).
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,S,O,M,P}.

Choosing a common word with several fresh letters will give the most information. “FIGHT” fits:
- It includes T at the 5th position (different from position 2).
- The other letters F, I, G, H are all still possible.
Thus it satisfies the constraints and will help narrow down the remaining letters.

We have confirmed letters: T is correct in position 5 (from QUILT). The feedback for I in QUILT was marked as ✓, but if that were a mistake, we still know I is in the word. To test both possibilities while introducing new letters, we can guess a word that ends with T, contains I, and uses letters we haven't tested. ""DIXIT"" (D I X I T) fits: it ends with T, includes I (twice), and adds D and X, which are still unknown. This will clarify whether I is at position 3 or elsewhere and test D and X.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, O, M, P are all NOT in the word.
- Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (the second slot of ""STOMP"").

So we need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains the letter T (anywhere except the second position).
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,S,O,M,P}.

Choosing a common word with several fresh letters will give the most information. “FIGHT” fits:
- It includes T at the 5th position (different from position 2).
- The other letters F, I, G, H are all still possible.
Thus it satisfies the constraints and will help narrow down the remaining letters.

We have confirmed:
- Letter T is correct in position 5.
- Letter I is correct in position 3.
- Letter X is present but not in position 3 (from the “X(-)” feedback on guess 5).

All other letters tested so far are not in the word: C R A N E S O M P F G H Q U L D B? (still possible) etc.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ _ I _ T and must contain an X in one of the remaining slots (1, 2, or 4). A possible English word that satisfies these constraints is **TWIXT** (T W I X T): it ends with T, has I in the third position, includes X (in position 4), and uses only letters not yet ruled out (W is still unknown). This guess will confirm the placement of X and test new letters.
