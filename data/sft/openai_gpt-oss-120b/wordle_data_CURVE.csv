### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with an initial guess. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters to gather useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E, with R somewhere in positions 3 or 4. We need a valid English word fitting that pattern and avoiding A and N.

""CHORE"" fits: C‑H‑O‑R‑E, with R at position 4 (allowed) and no forbidden letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- C is correct at position 1.
- E is correct at position 5.
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 (from first guess) nor 4 (from second guess), so R must be at position 3.
Thus the pattern is: C _ R _ E.

Letters known not to be in the word: A, N, H, O.

We need a common English word matching C?R?E with allowed letters in positions 2 and 4. The word **CURVE** fits perfectly:
- C at position 1,
- U (allowed) at position 2,
- R at position 3,
- V (allowed) at position 4,
- E at position 5.

Therefore the next guess should be CURVE.
