### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but NOT in the third position (its position in CRANE). For the next guess we should avoid the forbidden letters and place A in a different spot while testing new letters.

- Contains A in position 1 (different from position 3).

From the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, D, U, L, T.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (ADULT) nor 3 (CRANE). So A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

We need a new guess that includes A in one of those positions and uses only letters we haven't ruled out. Allowed letters are: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Choosing the word **BASKS**:
- A is at position 2 (still possible).

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: BASKS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(x) K(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined that the secret word has A in the second position. All other letters in previous guesses have been marked as not in the word: C, R, N, E, D, U, L, T, B, S, K, and also the first and third positions for A are ruled out. Therefore the remaining possible letters are: F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and A fixed at position 2).

To gather more information we should guess a word with A in the second slot that introduces several new letters from this remaining pool. “HAPPY” (H A P P Y) tests H, P, and Y while keeping A correctly placed.

This will help us narrow down the solution within the remaining attempts.

We have determined from the feedback:
- Position 2 is A (✓ from BASKS and HAPPY).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ from HAPPY).
- Letter P is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (both got “-”), so P must be in position 1.
- Letter D is in the word but not in position 2 (ADULT gave “-”), so D must be in position 3 or 4.
- All other letters tested have been marked absent (C,R,N,E,U,L,T,B,S,K,H).

Thus the pattern is P A _ _ Y with D occupying one of the middle slots. The common word that fits is **PADDY** (P A D D Y). This uses the required letters and respects all previous feedback.

Now we make the guess.
