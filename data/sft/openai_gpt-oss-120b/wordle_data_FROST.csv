### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and covers a range of vowel/consonant positions. “SLATE” is a good choice because it includes the vowels A and E and common consonants S, L, T.

We know from the feedback that S and T are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in SLATE (S was position 1, T was position 4). Letters L, A, and E are not in the word. We need a new 5‑letter guess containing S and T in different positions, and three other letters that are not L, A, or E. “GHOST” fits: it includes S (position 4) and T (position 5), avoids the excluded letters, and uses common letters for the remaining slots.

We have determined the secret word must have O in position 3, S in position 4, and T in position 5 (based on “GHOST” feedback). The first two letters are still unknown, but they cannot be L, A, E, G, H, L (already excluded). Selecting a word that fits the pattern __OST and introduces new letters will help pinpoint the first two positions. “FROST” fits perfectly: F R O S T, respects all known constraints, and tests two fresh letters (F and R).
