### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on ""CRANE"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word, and A is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore the next guess must include the letter A in a position other than the third, and must avoid using C, R, N, and E.

We know from previous feedback:
- The secret word starts with **A** (A is correct in position 1).
- The letter **O** is in the word but not in position 5 (it was marked “-” at position 5 in the guess AUDIO). Therefore O must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters **C, R, N, E, U, D, I** are not in the word.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Begins with A.
2. Contains O in one of the middle three positions.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **ALOFT**:
- A is already confirmed in the first slot.
- O appears in position 3, satisfying the “‑” clue.
- The remaining letters L, F, T are still unknown and will give us fresh information.

Thus the next guess will be “ALOFT”.
