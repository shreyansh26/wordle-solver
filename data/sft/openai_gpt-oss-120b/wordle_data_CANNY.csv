### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed it (‑). In guess 2 it was at position 5, so A must be somewhere else (positions 2 or 3). Position 2 is currently H (which is excluded), and position 3 is I (also excluded), so the only remaining places for A are positions 2 or 3.
- Letters R, E, H, I have been ruled out completely.

Thus the pattern is C _ _ N _. One viable English word that fits this pattern, respects the known letters, and introduces new letters is **CLANK** (C L A N K). It places A at position 3 (which satisfies the “‑” feedback) and adds L and K for further testing.
