### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess (CRANE) we learned:
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

Therefore the next guess must:
1. Include the letter R, but place it in a position other than 2 (e.g., position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Avoid using C, A, N, and E.
3. Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **RUSHY**:
- R is at position 1 (different from the previous position 2).
- U, S, H, Y are fresh letters that have not been tested yet.
- All letters are allowed (none of them are C, A, N, or E).

Thus “RUSHY” satisfies the constraints and will give useful feedback.
