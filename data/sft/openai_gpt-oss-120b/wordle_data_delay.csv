### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word.
- A and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (A is not position 3, E is not position 5).

We need a new word that:
- Includes A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than the 3rd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot.
- Avoids C, R, N entirely.
- Introduces new letters to test more possibilities.

“PLEAD” satisfies all conditions:
- Contains A (4th position) and E (3rd position), both different from the forbidden spots.
- Uses only new letters P, L, D besides A and E.
- No C, R, or N.

Thus “PLEAD” is a solid second guess.
