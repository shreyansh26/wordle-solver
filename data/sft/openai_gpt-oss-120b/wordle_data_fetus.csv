### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- E is confirmed at position 2 (✓).
- There is another E somewhere else (second E got '-' meaning E exists elsewhere). Positions 4 and 5 are ruled out for that second E (from earlier feedback), so it must be position 1 or 3. Position 1 cannot be E because no English word starts with EE and we need T elsewhere, so likely position 3.
- T is in the word but not at position 1 (from T(-) on guess 2). It can be positions 3‑5; position 3 already E, so T is likely at position 4 or 5.
- Remaining allowed letters: B, E, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

A word that fits: **BEETS** (B E E T S)
- Uses allowed letters only.
- Has E at position 2 and another E at position 3.
- Places T at position 4 (not position 1).
- No excluded letters.

Thus ""BEETS"" matches all known constraints.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Position 2 is E (E ✓ from HEDGE and BEETS).
- Position 5 is S (S ✓ from BEETS).
- Letter T is in the word, but not in position 1 (T - from TOWEL) and not in position 4 (T - from BEETS). The only remaining position for T is position 3, so T is at position 3.
- All letters marked x are not in the secret word: C, R, A, N, O, W, L, H, D, G, B, plus any repeats of those.
- No other constraints rule out Y, I, P, M, F, U, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Letter **T** is not in position 1 (T received “-” on guess 2) and not in position 4 (T received “-” on guess 4), so its only possible spot is position 3, which is already confirmed.
