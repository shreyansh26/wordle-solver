### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, N, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3.
- From GLOAT: G and T are not in the word; L, O, and A are in the word but each is in the wrong position.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **A, L, O** plus two other letters not among {C,R,N,E,G,T}.  
Positional restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 3.

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **POLKA**:
- Positions: P 1, O 2, L 3, K 4, A 5.
- O is not in position 3, L is not in position 2, A is not in positions 3 or 4.
- All letters are allowed (none of C, R, N, E, G, T).

Thus “POLKA” is a valid next guess.

- **POLKA**: P, K are not in the word; L is correct at position 3; O is in the word but not at position 2; A is in the word but not at position 5.

Summarizing the constraints:
- **L** = position 3 (fixed).
- **O** is in the word, but not positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5.
- **A** is in the word, but not positions 3, 4, 5 → possible positions 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, G, T, P, K.
- We still need two more letters that have not been tested yet.

A pattern that satisfies all positional restrictions is:
- Position 1 = unknown,
- Position 2 = **A**,
- Position 3 = **L**,
- Position 4 = **O**,
- Position 5 = unknown.

That gives the template **? A L O ?**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out is **SALVO** (S A L V O).

- S and V have not been excluded.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is correctly placed at position 3.
- O is in position 5 (allowed, not 2 or 3).
