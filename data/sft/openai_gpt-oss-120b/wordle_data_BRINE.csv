### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 4 is N (correct).
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- Letters C and A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word follows the pattern _ R _ N E.

Possible common words fitting that pattern are “DRONE” and “PRONE”. Both satisfy the known letters and avoid C and A. I’ll guess one of them to test the remaining unknown letters (position 1 and 3). I’ll choose “PRONE”.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = R (correct)
- Position 4 = N (correct)
- Position 5 = E (correct)
- Positions 1 and 3 are unknown.
Eliminated letters: C, A, O, P (they are not in the word).

So the word fits “_ R _ N E”. Common candidates are:
- BRINE (B R I N E)
- TRINE (T R I N E)
- URINE (U R I N E)

All use only letters not eliminated. I will guess **BRINE** to test the first letter (B) and confirm the third letter I.
