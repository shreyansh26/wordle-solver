### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and placements. “CRANE” is a popular starter word in this type of game because it covers common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We have confirmed:
- E is correct at position 2.
- C and R are in the word but not at the positions they occupied in previous guesses.
  • C cannot be at positions 1 or 4.
  • R cannot be at positions 2 or 3.
Thus viable placements are:
- C at position 3 or 5.
- R at position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).

Choosing C at 5 and R at 1 satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (L and I) to test other positions.

- Positions 1 and 2 are solved: R (✓) at 1, E (✓) at 2.
- Letter C is in the word but not at positions 1,4,5 → it must be at position 3.
So the secret word has the form **R E C _ _**.

The remaining two letters must be ones we haven’t ruled out (A, N, P, H, L, I are excluded). A common English word that fits the pattern is **RECUR** (R E C U R). It uses a new letter U and repeats R, which is allowed and not contradicted by any prior feedback.

Thus the next guess should be “RECUR”.

We have deduced the secret word’s first four letters are R E C U from the feedback on “RECUR”. The fifth letter is not R; we need to try another possible letter. A common English word that matches the pattern R E C U_ is “RECUT”. This will confirm whether the final letter is T and complete the word.
