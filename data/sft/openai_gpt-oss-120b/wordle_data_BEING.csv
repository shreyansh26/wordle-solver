### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- N is correct at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.
- C, R, and A are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with N in the fourth slot and containing E somewhere in positions 1‑3. The word must avoid C, R, and A.

The word **SPEND** fits all constraints:
- Pattern: S P E N D → N is at position 4.
- E is at position 3 (not position 5).
- No C, R, or A appear.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 4 is definitely **N** (both guesses gave a ✓ at that spot).
- The letter **E** is in the word but not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from SPEND). Therefore E can only be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters **C, R, A, S, P, D** are not in the word.

We need a common five‑letter word with N in the fourth slot and E in the first or second slot, using none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is **EBONY**:

- Pattern: E B O N Y → N is at position 4.
- E is at position 1 (acceptable).
- B, O, Y have not been ruled out.

Thus EBONY satisfies all current constraints and will give useful new information.

- N is correct at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.
- C, R, and A are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with N in the fourth slot and containing E somewhere in positions 1‑3. The word must avoid C, R, and A.

The word **SPEND** fits all constraints:
- Pattern: S P E N D → N is at position 4.
- E is at position 3 (not position 5).
- No C, R, or A appear.

Thus SPEND is a valid next guess.

Guess 2: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) E(-) N(✓) D(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 4 is definitely **N** (both guesses gave a ✓ at that spot).
- The letter **E** is in the word but not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from SPEND). Therefore E can only be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters **C, R, A, S, P, D** are not in the word.

We need a common five‑letter word with N in the fourth slot and E in the first or second slot, using none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is **EBONY**:

- Pattern: E B O N Y → N is at position 4.
- E is at position 1 (acceptable).
- B, O, Y have not been ruled out.

Thus EBONY satisfies all current constraints and will give useful new information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the constraints:
- Position 4 is definitely **N**.
- Letter **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,3,5, so E must be at position 2.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, B, C, D, O, P, R, S, Y and also the letters from earlier guesses that were marked x: C,R,A,S,P,D,B,O,Y.
- Remaining allowed letters for the other slots are any letters not excluded, e.g., F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word of the form **_ E _ N _** using only allowed letters. The word **FEINT** fits perfectly:
- F (allowed) at position 1
- E at position 2 (required)
- I (allowed) at position 3
- N at position 4 (confirmed)
- T (allowed) at position 5

Thus FEINT satisfies all known constraints and will give further information.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = E (from FEINT ✓)
- Position 3 = I (from FEINT ✓)
- Position 4 = N (from all ✓)
- Letter B is in the word but not at position 2 (EBONY gave B(-)), so B must be at position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters (x) are C, R, A, S, P, D, O, Y, F, T.

Thus the word pattern is either **B E I N _** or **_ E I N B**.  
The common English word **BEING** fits the first pattern, uses allowed letters (G is not excluded), and places B at position 1, satisfying B not being at position 2.

Therefore the next guess should be “BEING”.
