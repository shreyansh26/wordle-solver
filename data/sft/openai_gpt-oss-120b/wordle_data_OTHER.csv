### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess of a 5‑letter English word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequent letters in different positions to get useful feedback. ""SLATE"" is a good starter word.

We have feedback from the first guess SLATE:
- S, L, A are not in the secret word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain T and E in other positions. We should avoid S, L, A in the next guess and place T and E in new slots while testing new letters.

A good candidate is **TRIED**:
- T is moved to position 1 (allowed, since we only know it’s not position 4).
- E is moved to position 4 (allowed, since we only know it’s not position 5).
- New letters R, I, D give us more information.

We know from feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, I, D are not in the word.
- The word contains T, R, and E.
- E is correct at position 4.
- T is in the word but not at positions 1 or 4, so possible positions: 2,3,5.
- R is in the word but not at position 2, so possible positions: 1,3,5.

We need a five‑letter English word with pattern _ _ _ E _, containing T and R in allowed spots.  
The word “OTHER” fits:
- Position 1 O (new letter)
- Position 2 T (allowed)
- Position 3 H (new letter)
- Position 4 E (✓)
- Position 5 R (allowed)

All constraints are satisfied, and no excluded letters appear.
