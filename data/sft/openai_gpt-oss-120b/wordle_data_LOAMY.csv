### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has A in the third position and does not contain the letters C, R, N, or E anywhere. We need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more information. A good candidate is “PLAIT” (P‑L‑A‑I‑T), which places A correctly at position 3 and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

We have the following known constraints from feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- L is in the word but not in positions 2,4,5 → L must be at position 1.
- M is in the word but not in position 2 → M can be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters excluded (x): C, R, N, E, P, I, T, S.
We need a word of the form L _ A _ _. Including M at either position 4 or 5, and using only letters not excluded.
The word “LOAMY” fits perfectly:
- L at position 1,
- O (new letter, allowed) at position 2,
- A at position 3 (✓),
- M at position 4 (provides the required M),
- Y (new letter, allowed) at position 5.
All letters are permissible and no extra L's appear.
Thus the next guess should be LOAMY.
