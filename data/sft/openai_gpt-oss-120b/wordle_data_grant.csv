### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that will give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a frequent starter in word‑guessing games because it contains commonly used letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know the secret word's pattern from feedback: positions 2‑4 are R, A, N. Position 1 is not C, and position 5 is not E. So the word looks like _ R A N _. Viable common words include DRANK, FRANK, BRAND, CRANK (C excluded), PRANK (P is possible). Choosing FRANK introduces two new letters (F and K) that we haven't tested yet, giving the most new information.
