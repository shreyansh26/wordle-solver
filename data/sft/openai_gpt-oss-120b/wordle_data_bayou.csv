### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess gave us the following information:
- C, R, N, and E are NOT in the secret word.
- A is in the word but NOT in the third position (it was third in CRANE).

Therefore the secret word must contain the letter A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, R, N, E entirely.

I need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Includes A in a different position (preferably position 1 to test that spot).
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
3. Is a common English word.

“AUDIO” meets these criteria:
- A is in position 1 (different from the previous third position).
- U, D, I, O are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- No prohibited letters (C, R, N, E) appear.

Thus, “AUDIO” is a good second guess.

We know the secret word contains the letters A, U, and O (each was marked “-”, meaning present but in the wrong position).  
From the feedback we have position restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5  
- U cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5  
- O cannot be in position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4  

All other tested letters (C, R, N, E, D, I) are not in the word.

We need a new guess that includes A, U, and O in positions we haven’t ruled out, and also introduces a fresh letter to learn more about the remaining two slots.

The word **GOUDA** satisfies all constraints:
- A is placed at position 5 (allowed).
- U is at position 3 (allowed, not position 2).
- O is at position 2 (allowed, not position 5).
- It introduces the new letter **G** while using **D**, which we already know is absent (will be marked “x”, confirming that knowledge).

Thus “GOUDA” is a good next guess.
