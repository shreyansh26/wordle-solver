We have determined that positions 2-5 are O R S E respectively. The first letter is still unknown, and the letters eliminated so far are C, A, N, M, H, U, and also R cannot be first (already placed at third). Possible words fitting _ORSE are: WORSE, GORSE, TORSE (less common), and maybe BORTE? Not valid. The most common English word is ""WORSE"", which will test W as the first letter.
