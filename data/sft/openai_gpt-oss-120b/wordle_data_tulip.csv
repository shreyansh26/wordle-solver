### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore the next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word using only letters not yet ruled out. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T, all of which are still possible, so it’s a good next guess.

We know from the first guess that C, R, A, N, and E are not in the word.  
From the second guess (MIGHT) we learned:
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.
- M, G, H are not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain I and T, avoid the eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H), and place I somewhere other than the 2nd slot and T somewhere other than the 5th slot.

A valid candidate that meets all these constraints is **SPITS**:
- Contains I (in position 3) and T (in position 4), both not in the forbidden positions.
- Uses only letters S, P, I, T, S, none of which have been ruled out.

So the next guess will be “SPITS”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → all letters wrong → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

- Guess 3: SPITS → S is not in the word; P, I, T are present but in wrong spots (P not position 2, I not position 3, T not position 4).  

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **I, T, P** and none of the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,S}.  

Forbidden positions:
- I cannot be in positions 2, 3.
- T cannot be in positions 4, 5.
- P cannot be in position 2.

All other letters are still possible (B, D, F, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a real 5‑letter English word using I, T, P and two other allowed letters, respecting the position restrictions.  

**TULIP** fits perfectly:
- Contains T, U, L, I, P (all allowed letters, includes the required I, T, P).
- Positions: T (1) – allowed (not 4 or 5); I (4) – allowed (not 2 or 3); P (5) – allowed (not 2).
