### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the feedback:
- From CRANE: only E is correct at position 5.
- From SHOVE: O is correct at position 3, E again at 5, S is present but not at position 1, and H, V, C, R, A, N are absent.

So the word pattern is _ _ O _ E, containing an S somewhere other than the first letter (so S is either at position 2 or 4).  

A common word that fits this pattern is **LOOSE**:
- L O O S E matches the required O at third position and E at fifth.
- S is at position 4, satisfying the “S present but not first” clue.
- None of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, H, V) appear.

Thus “LOOSE” is a logical next guess.
