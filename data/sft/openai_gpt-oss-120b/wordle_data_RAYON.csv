### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the exact positions of most letters:

- Position 1: R (✓ from RADON)
- Position 2: A (✓ from MACHO and confirmed in RADON)
- Position 4: O (✓ from FAVOR and RADON)
- Position 5: N (✓ from RADON)

The only unknown is the third letter. All letters marked x in previous feedback are not in the secret word: S, L, T, E, M, C, H, F, V, D. The remaining possible letters include B, G, I, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already‑used letters R, A, O, N (which could repeat but are already placed).

Looking for a common English word of the form **R A _ O N** that uses only allowed letters, “RAYON” fits perfectly (R A Y O N). Y has not been eliminated, and the word is valid.

Thus the next guess should be **RAYON**.
