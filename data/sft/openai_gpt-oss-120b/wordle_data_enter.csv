### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that:
- S, L, A are not in the secret word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the next guess must contain T and E, placed in positions other than those prohibited, and avoid S, L, A. Choosing a word that also introduces new letters will give us more information. “TREND” satisfies these conditions: it has T (position 1) and E (position 3), avoids the excluded letters, and adds R, N, D for testing.

- Position 1 cannot be any of the letters we have already ruled out: S, L, A, D, I.
- A common English word fitting the pattern is **ENTER** (E N T E R). This will test whether the word contains a second E in position 1; if the secret has only one E, the first E will be marked “x”, otherwise it will be “✓”.
