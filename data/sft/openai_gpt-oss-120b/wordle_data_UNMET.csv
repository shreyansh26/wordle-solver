### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- N is definitely in the word at position 2 (from ENJOY feedback).
- E is in the word but not at positions 1, 2, 5. Therefore E can be at position 3 or 4.
- The remaining three letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the letters already ruled out.

Considering the pattern:
- Position 2 = N

A word that fits this pattern and uses only unused letters is **INEPT** (I N E P T):
- N is at position 2 (correct).
- E is at position 3 (allowed).
- I, P, and T have not been eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a new guess that includes N and E in different positions and avoids C, R, A. A good candidate is “BEGUN”:
- Contains N (at position 5, which is allowed) and E (at position 2, which is allowed).
- Introduces new letters B, G, U for further information.

Thus we will guess “BEGUN”.

- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: N and E.

Positions ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from BEGUN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE) or 2 (from BEGUN), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Choosing a word that places N and E in allowed positions and introduces new letters not yet ruled out, “ENJOY” fits:
- E at position 1 (allowed)
- N at position 2 (allowed)
- J, O, Y are fresh letters.

Thus the next guess is ENJOY.
