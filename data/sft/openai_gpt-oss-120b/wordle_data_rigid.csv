### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter R is in the word but not in position 2. For the next guess, we should avoid the excluded letters and place R in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5). A good candidate is ""SWORD"": it contains R at position 4, and uses new letters S, W, O, D that haven’t been ruled out yet.

We have the following feedback:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, A, N, E are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2.
- From guess 2 (SWORD): S, W, O are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 4. D is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **D**, contains **R** somewhere other than positions 2 or 4, and does not contain any of the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, S, W, O). R can be at position 1 or 3. A plausible word with R at position 1, D at position 5, and using only letters not yet ruled out is **RIGID**.

So the next guess is:
