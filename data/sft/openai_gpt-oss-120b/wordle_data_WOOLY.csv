### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- BLOOM: B is not in the word; L is in the word but not in position 2; O at position 3 is correct; the second O is in the word but not in position 4; M is not in the word.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains O at position 3.
- Contains another O somewhere other than position 4 (could be 1, 2, or 5).
- Contains an L, but not at position 2.
- Excludes the letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, S, T, B, M.

A word that fits all these constraints is **FOOLY**:
- Pattern F O O L Y → O in positions 2 and 3 (position 3 matches, position 2 gives the second O not at 4).
- L is in position 4 (not position 2).
- Uses only letters F, O, L, Y, none of which have been ruled out.

Therefore, FOOLY is a valid next guess.

From the last feedback:
- F is not in the word (position 1).
- O is correct in positions 2 and 3.
- L is correct in position 4.
- Y is correct in position 5.

So the secret word must be ? O O L Y, with the first letter not being any previously eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,E,G,H,S,T,B,M,F). The only common English word fitting this pattern and using an allowed first letter is ""WOOLY"".
