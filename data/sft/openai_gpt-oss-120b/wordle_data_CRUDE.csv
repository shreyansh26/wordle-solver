I need to start the word-guessing game with a common five‑letter word that will give useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a frequent choice in these games because it contains a mix of common consonants and a vowel, and it includes both a repeated vowel (A) and a varied set of letters. This should give a good range of feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word has C in position 1, R in position 2, and E in position 5. Letters A and N are ruled out completely. We need a valid English word of the form C R _ _ E with no A or N in the remaining slots. ""CRUDE"" fits: C‑R‑U‑D‑E, uses none of the excluded letters and is a common word. This will test whether U and D are present and in which positions.
