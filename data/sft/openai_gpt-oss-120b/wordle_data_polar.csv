### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to give useful information about the secret word. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letters L and A, but not in the positions they were in the guess ""SLATE"" (L was 2nd, A was 3rd). The letters S, T, and E are not in the word at all. For the next guess we should include L and A in different positions, avoid the banned letters, and introduce new letters to test. “BALMY” places A in position 2 and L in position 3 (both different from before) and adds B, M, Y as new candidates, while containing no prohibited letters.

We know:
- L is correct at position 3 (from BALMY feedback).
- A is in the word but not at positions 2 (from both guesses) nor 3 (occupied by L). So A can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters S, T, E, B, M, Y are not in the word.

We need a word with pattern _ _ L _ _, containing A in one of the allowed slots, and only using letters not yet ruled out. “POLAR” fits:
- L is third.
- A is fourth (allowed).
- New letters P, O, R have not been eliminated.
Thus it will test A’s placement and introduce three fresh letters.

Proceed with this guess.
