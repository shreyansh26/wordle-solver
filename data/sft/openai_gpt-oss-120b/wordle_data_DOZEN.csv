### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it had in ""CRANE"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions, avoids C, R, A, and tries new letters for the remaining slots.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A are not in the word; N is in the word but NOT in position 4; E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- From UNSET: U, S, T are not in the word; N is still NOT in position 2; E is correct in position 4.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains **N** and **E**.
- **E** is fixed at position 4.
- **N** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (and also not in position 4 from the first guess). So N can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, U, S, T, plus any letters already marked “x”.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern ___E_ where the fourth letter is E, it includes N (in position 1, 3, or 5), and does not use any excluded letters.  

A good candidate is **LINEN**:
- L I N E N → E is at position 4 (✓).
- N appears at positions 3 and 5, satisfying the “not in 2 or 4” rule.
- Letters L, I are not excluded, and no prohibited letters appear.

Thus “LINEN” respects all known constraints and introduces new letters L and I for further insight.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it had in ""CRANE"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions, avoids C, R, A, and tries new letters for the remaining slots. 
A good candidate is **UNSET**:
- Contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), satisfying the position constraints.
- Uses new letters U, S, T which have not been ruled out.
- No C, R, or A appear.
Thus ""UNSET"" is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A are not in the word; N is in the word but NOT in position 4; E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- From UNSET: U, S, T are not in the word; N is still NOT in position 2; E is correct in position 4.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains **N** and **E**.
- **E** is fixed at position 4.
- **N** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (and also not in position 4 from the first guess). So N can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, U, S, T, plus any letters already marked “x”.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern ___E_ where the fourth letter is E, it includes N (in position 1, 3, or 5), and does not use any excluded letters.  

A good candidate is **LINEN**:
- L I N E N → E is at position 4 (✓).
- N appears at positions 3 and 5, satisfying the “not in 2 or 4” rule.
- Letters L, I are not excluded, and no prohibited letters appear.

Thus “LINEN” respects all known constraints and introduces new letters L and I for further insight.

We have the following feedback so far:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A are not in the word. N is in the word but not position 4. E is in the word but not position 5.
- Guess 2 (UNSET): U, S, T are not in the word. N is still not in position 2. E is correct at position 4.
- Guess 3 (LINEN): L, I are not in the word. The first N (position 3) is in the word but wrong position; the second N (position 5) is correct. This tells us the word contains two N’s, one of which is at the last position, and the other cannot be at positions 2, 3, 4.
- Guess 4 (WOKEN): W and K are not in the word. O is correct at position 2. E is correct at position 4. N is correct at position 5.

From these we deduce:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = N
- Position 1 must also be N (the second N revealed by LINEN)
- Position 3 is still unknown, but must be a letter not yet ruled out (cannot be C,R,A,U,S,T,L,I,W,K).

Allowed remaining letters include B, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern **N O _ E N** is **NOMEN** (meaning “name” in Latin, used in English contexts such as “nomenclature”). The middle letter M is not excluded.

Thus the next guess should be NOMEN.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

N is in the word but not position\u202f4. E is in the word but not position\u202f5.\n- Guess 2 (UNSET): U, S, T are not in the word. N is still not in position\u202f2. E is correct at position\u202f4.\n- Guess 3 (LINEN): L, I are not in the word. The first N (position\u202f3) is in the word but wrong position; the second N (position\u202f5) is correct. This tells us the word contains two N’s, one of which is at the last position, and the other cannot be at positions\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4.\n- Guess 4 (WOKEN): W and K are not in the word. O is correct at position\u202f2. E is correct at position\u202f4. N is correct at position\u202f5.\n\nFrom these we deduce:\n- Position\u202f2 = O\n- Position\u202f4 = E\n- Position\u202f5 = N\n- Position\u202f1 must also be N (the second N revealed by LINEN)\n- Position\u202f3 is still unknown, but must be a letter not yet ruled out (cannot be C,R,A,U,S,T,L,I,W,K).\n\nAllowed remaining letters include B, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z, etc.\n\nA common English word fitting the pattern **N O _ E N** is **NOMEN** (meaning “name” in Latin, used in English contexts such as “nomenclature”). The middle letter M is not excluded.\n\nThus the next guess should be NOMEN.\n\n<guess>NOMEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNSET -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: LINEN -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) N(✓)\nGuess 4: WOKEN -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)\nGuess 5: NOMEN -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Current known constraints:
- Position 2 = O (from WOKEN and NOMEN)
- Position 4 = E (confirmed)
- Position 5 = N (confirmed)
- Letters that cannot appear: C, R, A, U, S, T, L, I, W, K, M, plus any other letters marked x.
- Remaining letters are free to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, Y, Z, etc.

We need a word of the form _ O _ E N. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowable letters is **DOZEN** (D O Z E N). This introduces new letters D and Z for further information and respects all known constraints.

Thus the next guess should be DOZEN.
