### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- The 5th letter is **T** (✓).
- The letter **I** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (both previous guesses gave I(-)). So I can be in position 1 or 3.
- The letter **S** is in the word but not in position 1 (S(-) from SPLIT). So S can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, P, L.
- All other letters are still possible.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **TWIST**:
- Ends with T (position 5 correct).
- Contains I at position 3 (allowed) and S at position 4 (allowed, since S is not allowed at position 1).
- Uses letters W and another T, none of which have been excluded.

Thus TWIST is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:
- The 5th letter is **T** (✓).
- The letter **I** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (both previous guesses gave I(-)). So I can be in position 1 or 3.
- The letter **S** is in the word but not in position 1 (S(-) from SPLIT). So S can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, P, L.
- All other letters are still possible.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **TWIST**:
- Ends with T (position 5 correct).
- Contains I at position 3 (allowed) and S at position 4 (allowed, since S is not allowed at position 1).
- Uses letters W and another T, none of which have been excluded.

Thus TWIST is a valid next guess.

- Position 3: I (✓ from JOIST)
- Position 4: S (✓ from JOIST)
- Position 5: T (✓ from JOIST)

The first letter must be a remaining alphabet letter that hasn't been ruled out and can occupy position 1.

Possible candidates include B, D, F, K, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z. Among common English words matching _ O I S T, **FOIST** (F‑O‑I‑S‑T) is valid and uses F, which has not been excluded.
