### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it covers two frequent vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid those letters entirely and try new common letters, especially the remaining vowels I, O, U. A good candidate is “PIVOT”, which introduces five fresh letters (P, I, V, O, T) none of which have been ruled out yet.

We know from feedback:
- CRANE: all letters are not in the secret word (C,R,A,N,E eliminated).
- PIVOT: P is present but in the wrong position (first slot). I, V, O, T are not in the word.

Thus the secret word contains the letter P somewhere in positions 2‑5, and none of the letters C,R,A,N,E,I,V,O,T are usable.

We need a new guess that:
1. Includes P, but not in the first position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.
3. Gives us new information about the remaining letters.

A good candidate is **SLUMP**:
- Contains P in the 5th position (testing a new spot for P).
- Introduces new letters S, L, U, M, all of which are still possible.

This guess should help identify the correct placement of P and reveal other letters.
