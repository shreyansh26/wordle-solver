### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 4 cannot be T, G, U, N, A, C (all ruled out). So we need a new letter there.

The word must fit the pattern _ O R _ E. Viable common English words fitting this pattern and avoiding excluded letters are:
- HORSE (H O R S E) – letters H and S have not been tried.
- MORSE (M O R S E) – letters M and S have not been tried.

Both satisfy all constraints. I will choose HORSE for the next guess.

We have derived the exact positions of four letters:
- Position 1 = H (confirmed ✓)
- Position 2 = O (confirmed ✓)
- Position 3 = R (confirmed ✓)
- Position 5 = E (confirmed ✓)

Position 4 is still unknown, but we know:
- S is not in the word (S got an x on position 4).
- Previously eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, G, F, T, S.
Thus the remaining candidate letters for position 4 are any letters not yet excluded.

The common English word fitting the pattern **H O R _ E** with a fresh fourth letter is **HORDE** (H‑O‑R‑D‑E). The letter D has not been tried and is not among the excluded letters.

Therefore the next guess should be “HORDE”.
