### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- The letter E is correct in position 5.
- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 1 (from ANODE). Therefore A can be in position 2 or 4.
- The letter N is in the word but not in positions 2, 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from ANODE). Therefore N can be in position 1 or 3.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **NAIVE**:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have gathered the following constraints from the feedback:

- Letter **E** is correct in position 5.
- Letter **A** is correct in position 2.
- Letter **N** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4, leaving position 3 as the only possibility.
- Letters **C, R, O, D, I, V** are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ A N _ E** with only positions 1 and 4 unknown, using letters that have not been ruled out.

A common English word that matches this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **MANSE** (M A N S E).

Therefore, the next guess should be “MANSE”.

- Position 5: E (✓)
- Position 4: unknown, but cannot be any letters marked x: C, R, O, D, I, V, S, plus any other previously ruled out. The letter G has not been ruled out, and the English word “MANGE” (M A N G E) fits the pattern and uses an allowed letter.
