### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is **P** (✓).
- Position 5 is **E** (✓).
- **A** and **T** are not in the word (x).
- **S** is in the word but not in position 3 (-), so it must be in position 2 or 4.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form P _ _ _ E that contains an S in either the 2nd or 4th slot and no A or T.  
A good candidate that fits these constraints and introduces new letters for more information is **PROSE** (P‑R‑O‑S‑E). It places S at position 4, respects the known letters, and tests R and O.

Thus the next guess will be:
