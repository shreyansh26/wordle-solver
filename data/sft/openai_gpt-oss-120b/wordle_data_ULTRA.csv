### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified the letters that must be in the secret word and those that are not.

**Confirmed letters (present but misplaced):**
- **R** – cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- **A** – cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- **L** – cannot be in position 4.

**Letters that are definitely not in the word:** C, N, E, I, S.

We need two additional letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Choosing **M** and **O** (both still possible) gives us the word **MOLAR**, which places the known letters in allowed positions:

- M (1) – new test letter  
- O (2) – new test letter  
- L (3) – allowed (L isn’t in position 4)  
- A (4) – allowed (A isn’t in positions 2 or 3)  
- R (5) – allowed (R isn’t in positions 1 or 2)

This guess will confirm whether M and O belong in the solution and will further locate R, A, and L.
