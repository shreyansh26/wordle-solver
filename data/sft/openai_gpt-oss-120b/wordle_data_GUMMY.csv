- U is in position 2 (U is present and not in position 3).
- All other letters (M, Y) are from the allowed set.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 2 is U (✓ from MUMMY and DUMMY).
- Positions 3 and 4 are M (✓ from MUMMY).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ from MUMMY and DUMMY).

Thus the word is of the form **_ U M M Y**.

Letters known not to be in the word (marked x) are: C, R, A, N, E, S, H, I, F, T, P, L, B, D.

Allowed letters for the first position are therefore any alphabet letters not in the excluded set and not already used, e.g., G, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Z, or possibly Y.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **GUMMY** (G U M M Y), using G which has not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be ""GUMMY"".
