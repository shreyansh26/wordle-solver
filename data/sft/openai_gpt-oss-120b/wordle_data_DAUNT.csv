### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, E are not in the word; N is correct at position 4; A is in the word but not at position 3.
- From AMINO: A is still not at position 1; M, I, O are not in the word; N confirmed at position 4.

Thus A must be at position 2 or 5, and the pattern is _ _ _ N _.
We need a 5‑letter word with N fourth, containing A in position 2 or 5, and none of the excluded letters (C,R,E,M,I,O).  

A good candidate is **LAWNS**:
- L A W N S fits the pattern (A at position 2, N at position 4).
- None of its letters are among the eliminated set.

So we will guess ""LAWNS"".

- N is correct and in position 4 (✓ from all guesses).
- A is correct and in position 2 (✓ from guess 3). Earlier feedback showed A is present but not in positions 1 or 3.
- The pattern of the secret word is therefore: _ A _ N _.

We need a valid English word fitting this pattern that uses only letters not excluded. Remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

A word that satisfies all constraints is **VAUNT**:
- V (allowed) A (position 2, ✓) U (allowed) N (position 4, ✓) T (allowed).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be “VAUNT”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
