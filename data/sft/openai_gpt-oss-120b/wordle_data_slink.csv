### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:
- The fourth letter is N (confirmed by guesses 1‑3).
- The first letter is S (✓ from guess 3).
- The third letter is I (✓ from guess 3).
- Letters C, R, A, E, M, O, U, D, W, G are not in the word (all marked x).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern S _ I N _. The remaining unknown positions are 2 and 5, and must use letters that have not been ruled out. Viable common letters include T, K, L, P, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is **STINK** (S‑T‑I‑N‑K), which respects the known letters and introduces only new letters T and K, both not excluded.

We have gathered the following information from the feedback:

- Position 1: S is correct (✓).
- Position 3: I is correct (✓).
- Position 4: N is correct (✓).
- Position 5: K is correct (✓).
- Position 2 is still unknown. The letters that have been ruled out for any position are: C, R, A, E, M, O, U, D, W, G, T.  
- Therefore, the second letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated. Viable common letters include L, B, F, H, J, P, Y, etc.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern **S _ I N K**.  
The word “SLINK” (S‑L‑I‑N‑K) matches the known letters, uses L (which has not been eliminated), and is a common word.  

Thus, “SLINK” is a strong next guess.
