### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains I and F (since they are confirmed present) but places them in different slots: I cannot be fourth, F cannot be fifth. A good candidate that uses only allowed letters and avoids the forbidden positions is **FIZZY** (F at position 1, I at position 2, Z Z Y are all unused letters). This satisfies all constraints and also gives us new letters Z and Y to test.

We have confirmed letters and positions:
- I is correct at position 2 (from guess 4).
- Y is correct at position 5 (from guess 4).
- F is in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 5. It must be at position 3 or 4.

All other letters tested so far are not in the word: A, C, E, H, L, N, P, R, S, U, Z, M, O, T, C, R, A, N, E, P, L, U, S, H, M, O, T.  
Remaining possible letters are B, D, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X (plus the confirmed I, F, Y).

We need a 5‑letter word fitting the pattern: _ I _ _ Y, with F at position 3 or 4.  
The common word **JIFFY** matches: J (pos 1) I (pos 2) F (pos 3) F (pos 4) Y (pos 5). It uses only allowed letters and tests the two remaining unknown positions for F while introducing a new letter J.
