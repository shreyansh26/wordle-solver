### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word, and the letter E is correct and in the 5th position. Therefore the secret word must end with E and contain none of C, R, A, N. I’ll choose a word that ends with E and introduces new letters to test. “MOUSE” fits: M, O, U, S are all unused and not forbidden, and it ends with E.

We have feedback from previous guesses:
- CRANE: only E correct in position 5.
- MOUSE: only E correct in position 5; other letters eliminated.
- GLIDE: G and D eliminated; L and I are present but in wrong spots; E confirmed at position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with E, contains L and I (not in positions 2 and 3 respectively), and must avoid letters C,R,A,N,M,O,U,S,G,D. Remaining candidate letters include B, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need a word ending in E that includes L and I, with L not at position 2 and I not at position 3. The word “LITHE” fits:
- Positions: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5).
- L is not in position 2, I is not in position 3.
- New letters T and H have not been tried yet.
Thus “LITHE” is a good next guess.
