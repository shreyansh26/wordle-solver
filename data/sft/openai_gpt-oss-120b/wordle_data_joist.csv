### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- T is correct in position 5 (✓).

- S is in the word but not in position 1 (‑ from SPLIT).

Thus the secret word must:
- End with **T**.
- Contain **I** (not at positions 2 or 4) → I can be at position 1 or 3.
- Contain **S** (not at position 1) → S can be at positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Use only letters that have not been eliminated.

The word **TWIST** satisfies all constraints:
- Pattern: T W I S T → ends with T.
- I is at position 3 (allowed).
- S is at position 4 (allowed, not position 1).
- No eliminated letters appear.

Therefore TWIST is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- Letters **C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,P,L,W** are not in the word (all scored x).
- **T** is correct at position 5 (✓). The first T got a “-”, meaning T is in the word but not at position 1; it could still be the same single T at position 5.
- **I** is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4 (‑ from guesses 2 and 3, and ✓ at position 3 from TWIST).
- **S** is in the word but not at position 1 (‑ from SPLIT), and ✓ at position 4 from TWIST.
- Therefore the pattern must be **_ _ I S T**, with the only known letters being I (pos 3), S (pos 4) and T (pos 5).  
  Position 1 cannot be S (S not allowed in first slot) and cannot be any eliminated letters.  
  Position 2 cannot be I (already placed) and also must avoid eliminated letters.

Remaining possible letters (not eliminated) are: **B, D, F, J, K, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z** (plus the already‑known I, S, T).

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching **_ _ I S T** using only these letters.  
One valid candidate is **ODIST** (O‑D‑I‑S‑T), which satisfies:
- O and D are allowed letters,
- I is at position 3,
- S at position 4,
- T at position 5,
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be **ODIST**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- T is correct in position 5 (✓).

- S is in the word but not in position 1 (‑ from SPLIT).

Thus the secret word must:
- End with **T**.

- Contain **S** (not at position 1) → S can be at positions 2, 3, or 4.

The word **TWIST** satisfies all constraints:
