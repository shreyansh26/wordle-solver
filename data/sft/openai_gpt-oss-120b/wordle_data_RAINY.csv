### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid five‑letter English word. There is no prior information, so I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. “ARISE” is a good starter because it includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). This should give me a broad sense of which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first guess that:
- Letter I is correct and in the 3rd position.
- Letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.
Thus the secret word has the form __I__ with none of those excluded letters.
We need a common 5‑letter word fitting that pattern and avoiding A,R,S,E. “PLINK” (P L I N K) satisfies all constraints.

We have confirmed letters:
- I is correct at position 3.
- N is correct at position 4.

From the first guess, A and R are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (A not at position 1, R not at position 2).  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: S, E, P, L, K.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ I N _. It must contain A and R in positions other than those excluded.  
The word “RAINY” fits:
- R at position 1 (allowed, R isn’t prohibited there).
- A at position 2 (allowed, A isn’t prohibited there).
- I at position 3 (confirmed).
- N at position 4 (confirmed).
- Y at position 5 (a new letter not yet ruled out).

Thus “RAINY” satisfies all constraints and is a valid guess.
