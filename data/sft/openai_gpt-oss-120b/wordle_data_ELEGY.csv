### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore, the secret word must contain E somewhere in positions 1‑4. For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Contains E in a non‑final position.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, R, A, N.
- Introduces new letters to test possibilities.

The word **BLESS** fits these criteria:
- E is in the 3rd position (not the 5th).
- It uses new letters B, L, S while staying clear of C, R, A, N.
Thus it will give useful information for the next step.

We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5 that are not any excluded letters. A good common word fitting the pattern is **FLEET** (F L E E T), which introduces new letters F and T and also tests whether a second E is present.

We have established the following from feedback:
- Positions: 2 = L (✓), 3 = E (✓).
- Position 4 = E received '-', meaning the letter E exists elsewhere in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have an E at position 3, the '-' suggests there is another E in the word (at a different position), likely position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, A, N, B, S, O, U, M, F, T, and also any letters not yet tested.
- Remaining possible letters: D, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly another E.

A word that satisfies the pattern **_ L E _ _**, includes a second E, and uses only allowed letters is **E L E G Y**:
- Position 1 = E (provides the second E required by the '-' feedback on position 4).
- Position 2 = L (✓ confirmed).
- Position 3 = E (✓ confirmed).
- Position 4 = G (new, untested, allowed).
- Position 5 = Y (new, untested, allowed).

All letters are permissible, and the structure matches all previous clues. This makes “ELEGY” an optimal next guess.
