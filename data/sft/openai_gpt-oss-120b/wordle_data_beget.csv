### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, L, A are not in the secret word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore the next guess must include T and E, placed in different positions from those in SLATE, and must avoid S, L, A entirely. A good candidate is **TRIED**:
- T is now in position 1 (different from position 4).
- E is now in position 4 (different from position 5).
- The other letters R, I, D are new and do not violate any known constraints.
