### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the previous guess:
- Letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (x).
- Letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the next guess must:
1. Exclude C, R, A, N.
2. Include the letter E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **TOEKS**:
- Contains E in the 3rd position (different from position 5).

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, K.
- Letter E is confirmed at position 3 (✓).
- Letter S is in the word but not at position 5 (‑), so S can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
We need a 5‑letter word with E third, containing S (not at 5), and no excluded letters.  
The word **SPEED** fits:
- Pattern: S (1) P (2) E (3) E (4) D (5)
- Contains E at the required third position.
- Contains S at position 1 (acceptable).
- Uses only new letters P and D, none of which are excluded.

Thus the next guess should be “SPEED”.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Letters C, R, A, N, T, O, K, P, D are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word, not at positions 5 or 4, and it is correct at position 3.
- S is in the word, correct at position 1, and not at position 5.
- The second E in the guess “SPEED” got a “-”, meaning there is another E somewhere else in the word (so the secret word contains at least two E’s). Since E cannot be at positions 4 or 5, the remaining possible spot for the second E is position 2.

Thus the pattern so far is:

1 S  (✓)  
2 E  (must be E)  
3 E  (✓)  
4 ?  (new letter, not excluded)  
5 ?  (new letter, not excluded, not S)

We need a valid English word of the form **SEE??** where the last two letters are not any of the excluded letters and not S. A common candidate fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **SEELY** (S‑E‑E‑L‑Y).

So the next guess will be “SEELY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
