### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good opener because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as absent, so the secret word contains none of those letters. I need a new five‑letter word using only letters that haven't been ruled out. I'll choose common letters to maximize information while avoiding C, R, A, N, E. The word “LIGHT” uses L, I, G, H, T, all of which are still possible, so it’s a good next guess.

We have determined the following from feedback:

- I is correct in position 3 (I✓).
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (O-). Therefore O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out) are: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, W, X, Y, Z (and the known I).

We need a 5‑letter word with I at the third position and using only the allowed letters, while placing O somewhere other than position 2.  
The word **OXIFY** satisfies all constraints:

- No forbidden letters appear.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
