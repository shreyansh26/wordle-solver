### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, L, V are not in the secret word.
- Letter E is definitely at position 2 (✓ on second guess).
- Another E is present but not at position 4 (the second E got “-”), and it cannot be at position 5 (from first guess). So the second E must be at position 1 or 3.
- No other letters identified yet.

A word that fits these constraints and avoids the excluded letters is **SEEDS**:
- Position 2 is E (✓).
- It has a second E at position 3 (allowed, not position 4 or 5).
- Uses only S and D besides the E’s, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus, “SEEDS” is a valid next guess.

We need a 5‑letter English word with **E** at the second spot, containing a **D** somewhere other than positions 4 or 5, and using only allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- Another E is present but not at position 4 (the second E got “-”), and it cannot be at position 5 (from first guess). So the second E must be at position 1 or 3.
- No other letters identified yet.

A word that fits these constraints and avoids the excluded letters is **SEEDS**:
- Position 2 is E (✓).
- It has a second E at position 3 (allowed, not position 4 or 5).
- Uses only S and D besides the E’s, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus, “SEEDS” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:

- Guess 5 (DEPOT) gave D✓, E✓, P✓, O×, T‑.  
  So the secret word has D at position 1, E at 2, P at 3, and contains T but not at position 5.  
- The only remaining empty slots are positions 4 and 5.  
- Since T is present and cannot be at 5, it must be at position 4.  

Thus the pattern is **D E P T _**.  
The final letter must be a letter not previously ruled out (C,R,A,N,L,V,S,M,I,O are all excluded).  
The common English word matching this pattern is **DEPTH**, with H in the last position, which hasn't been eliminated.

Therefore the next guess should be “DEPTH”.
