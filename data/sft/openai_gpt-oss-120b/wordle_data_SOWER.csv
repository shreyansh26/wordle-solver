### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 4: E is correct (✓)
- Position 5: R is correct (✓)
- Position 1: R is present but not here (‑)
- V is not in the word (x)

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ E R, with R also appearing somewhere other than position 1 (the first R’s “‑” tells us there’s another R elsewhere). The only remaining slot besides position 5 is position 3, so the word must be ? O R E R.

A common English word that fits is **BORER** (B O R E R), satisfying all the constraints and using only allowed letters.

- Letters C, A, N, V, B are not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but only at position 5; other R’s in guesses got “-” because the single R is elsewhere.
Thus the secret word pattern is _ O _ E R.

We need a word fitting that pattern, using only allowed letters. Possible candidates include LOSER, DOZER, POKER, JOKER, GOFER, etc. Choosing a word with new letters will give more information.

I will guess **LOSER**.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = O (✓ from multiple guesses)
- Position 4 = E (✓)
- Position 5 = R (✓)

Letter S received a “-” on guess LOSER, meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. The only remaining open slot is position 1 (positions 2,4,5 are taken, position 3 cannot be S). Therefore S must be at position 1.

Thus the pattern is **S O _ E R**.

We need a valid English word fitting this pattern, using letters not yet ruled out (C, A, N, V, B, L are excluded). The word **SOWER** (S O W E R) fits perfectly and introduces the new letter W for additional information.

So the next guess is SOWER.
