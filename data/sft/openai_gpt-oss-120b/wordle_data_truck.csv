### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, E are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. I need a new 5‑letter guess that includes T (not in the 4th spot) and avoids S, L, A, E. A good candidate is **CRUIT** (C‑R‑U‑I‑T), which places T in the 5th position and introduces four new letters to test.

We have deduced the following from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, E, I.
- T is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5, so T must be position 1.
- R is correct at position 2.
- U is correct at position 3.
- C is in the word but not at position 1, so C can be position 4 or 5.

Thus the pattern is: T R U _ _. The word ""TRUCK"" fits this pattern, places C at position 4, introduces a new letter K, and avoids all excluded letters.
