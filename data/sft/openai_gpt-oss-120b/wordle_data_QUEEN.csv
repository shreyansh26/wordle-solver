### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:

- From CRANE: N is in the word but not in position 4; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From LEMON: N is correct in position 5; E is in the word but not in position 2.
- From SHEEN: Positions 3 (E) and 4 (E) are correct; position 5 (N) is correct.

Thus the hidden word must be of the form **__EEN**, with the first two letters still unknown. 
Letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, L, M, O, S, H, and also we know positions 1 and 2 cannot be E or N.

A common English word fitting **__EEN** and using only letters not yet eliminated is **QUEEN** (Q‑U‑E‑E‑N). This will test the remaining unknown letters Q and U.

So the next guess is:
