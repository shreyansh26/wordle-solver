### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 3 is A (correct).
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

So the word pattern is: _ R A _ _. We need a common English word fitting that pattern, using letters other than C, N, E. “GRASP” fits perfectly:
- G in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (matches)

We need a common English word of the form G R A _ _. The word “GRAIL” fits, using I and L which are still possible. It is a valid 5‑letter word and will test those two letters.
