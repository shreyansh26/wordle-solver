### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the next guess must contain the letter C (anywhere except the first slot) and avoid R, A, N, E. Choosing a word with common letters will give us more info. ""SCOUT"" places C in position 2 and adds S, O, U, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have identified that the letters C, T, H, and I are all present in the secret word (they each got a “–” feedback), while the letters R, A, N, E, S, O, U, K are absent.  

Constraints from the “–” feedback:
- C is not in positions 1, 2, or 4 → C can be in position 3 or 5.
- T is not in positions 1 or 5 → T can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- H is not in position 2 (it was guessed there in “thick”) → H can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- I is not in position 3 (it was guessed there in “thick”) → I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C, T, H, I plus one other allowed letter, respecting the position limits.  
The word **ITCHY** (I‑T‑C‑H‑Y) satisfies all constraints:
- C is at position 3 (allowed).
- T is at position 2 (allowed).
- H is at position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- I is at position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- Y is an unused, allowed letter.
