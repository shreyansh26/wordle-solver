### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it tests for C, R, A, N, and E, covering a vowel and several frequent consonants.

We know the secret word ends with E. The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. Letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word with E in the fifth slot, containing R somewhere other than position 2, and avoiding C, A, N. “MORSE” fits: M O R S E (R is in position 3, E is correct at position 5, and none of the excluded letters appear). This will give us more information about the remaining letters.

We need a word of the form __RSE using only letters not excluded. Good candidates are “TERSE” (T E R S E) and “VERSE” (V E R S E). Both fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters. I’ll try “TERSE” first.
