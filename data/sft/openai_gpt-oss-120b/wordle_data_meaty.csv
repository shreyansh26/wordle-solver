### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess SLATE we have:
- S and L are not in the word.
- A is correct at position 3.
- T is correct at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern __A T _. The letter E must be in position 1 or 2. No S or L can appear.

A viable word meeting these constraints is **NEATH** (N E A T H): 
- A is third, T is fourth,
- E is second (not fifth),
- contains no S or L.

So the next guess is NEATH.

From the feedback:
