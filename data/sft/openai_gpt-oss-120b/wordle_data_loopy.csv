### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the known letters and positions:
- Position 1: L (✓ from LOBBY)
- Position 2: O (✓ from LOBBY and FOULS)
- Position 5: Y (✓ from LOBBY)

Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H, T, F, U, S, B.

Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4 are those not eliminated, e.g., D, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and also O (since we haven't ruled out another O).

We need a valid English word fitting the pattern **L O _ _ Y** with the remaining letters. “LOOPY” (L‑O‑O‑P‑Y) satisfies:
- L at position 1, O at position 2, Y at position 5 (all correct).
- Position 3 is O (allowed, not eliminated).
- Position 4 is P (allowed, not eliminated).

Thus “LOOPY” is a suitable next guess.
