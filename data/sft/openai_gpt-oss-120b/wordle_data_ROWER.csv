### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified that the secret word contains the letters R and E.  
From the feedback:
- R is not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
- E is not in positions 2 or 5, so it can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  

Eliminated letters are C, A, N, B, T, H.  

We need a five‑letter word that includes R and E in allowed spots and uses only letters not eliminated.  
The word **RULER** fits:
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (both allowed).  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- The other letters U and L have not been ruled out.  

Thus RULER is a valid next guess.

We have determined the word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1 = R (correct)
- Position 2 = O (correct)
- Position 4 = E (correct)
- Position 5 = R (correct)

Only position 3 remains unknown. Letters proven not in the word are: C, A, N, B, T, H, U, L, V. Also R cannot be in position 3 (from earlier feedback). Therefore the third letter must be a new letter not among the excluded set.

Possible candidates include G, P, D, etc. The word **ROGER** fits the pattern R O G E R, using G which has not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess is ""ROGER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Eliminated letters are C, A, N, B, T, H.  

We need a five‑letter word that includes R and E in allowed spots and uses only letters not eliminated.  
The word **RULER** fits:

One common English word that fits the pattern **R O _ E R** and uses only allowed letters is **ROPER** (with P in the third position). “Roper” is a standard word, so it is a good next guess.
