### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial five‑letter guess. It should be a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters to give useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes a common vowel (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know from the first guess that:
- C and R are in the secret word but not in the positions we placed them (positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

For the next guess I need a word that:
1. Includes C and R (so we can confirm their correct positions later).
2. Does NOT contain A, N, or E.
3. Introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **FROCK**. It contains C and R, and adds the new letters F, O, and K for further clues, while avoiding A, N, and E.

- Position restrictions:

  * R cannot be in position 2.

- We need a new word containing C, R, O (to test their positions) and two other letters not yet excluded.

We have determined from the feedback that the secret word must contain the letters C, R, and O, each in a different position from where they appeared in previous guesses.  
- C cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 → possible positions: 2 or 3.  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5.  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5.  

A word that satisfies these position constraints and uses only letters not yet ruled out is **OCCUR**:
- O is at position 1 (allowed),  
- C occupies positions 2 and 3 (both allowed for C),  
- R is at position 5 (allowed),  
- the new letter U has not been tested yet.

Thus OCCUR is a valid next guess.
