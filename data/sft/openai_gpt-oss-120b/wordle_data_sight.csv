### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. There is no prior information, so I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common and less common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R) and two frequent vowels (A, E) plus an N.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed not to be in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters and includes different common letters to gather more information. “SHOUT” uses S, H, O, U, T – none of which appeared in the first guess – making it a good candidate.

From previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, O, U are not in the word.
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 5 is T (✓).
- H is in the word but not in position 2 (‑).

So the secret word has the form S _ _ _ T, contains H somewhere except position 2. A suitable English word meeting these constraints and avoiding all eliminated letters is **SIGHT** (S I G H T). It places H at position 4, which is allowed, and uses only letters not ruled out.
