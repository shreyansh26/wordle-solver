### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have these constraints:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, E, M, U, C, H.
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses). So L can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- We need to test new possible letters while keeping L in an allowed spot.

Choose a word with L placed at position 4 (or 5) and only using letters not yet ruled out. “GRILL” fits:
- G, R, I are untouched letters.
- L appears in positions 4 and 5, both allowed positions.
- No eliminated letters are used.

Thus “GRILL” is a valid next guess.

  * R is in the word but not in position 2 (–).
  * I is in the word but not in position 3 (–).
  * One L is correct (✓) and the other L is in the word but in the wrong spot (–). Since L cannot be in positions 2 or 3, the correct L must be either position 4 or 5.

So far we know:
- Position 1 = G
- The word contains R, I, and at least one L.
- R ≠ position 2, I ≠ position 3.
- L ≠ positions 2 or 3; one L is correctly placed at position 4 or 5.

We need a new guess that respects these constraints while testing new letters.  
A good candidate is **GIRLY**:

1 G – fixed correct.  
2 I – allowed (I is only forbidden in position 3).  
3 R – allowed (R is only forbidden in position 2).  
4 L – matches the likely correct L position.  
5 Y – a fresh letter to test.

All letters are allowed (none of S, A, T, E, M, U, C, H). This guess will confirm the exact positions of R, I, and the second L, and introduce Y for further information.
