### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letters C and E, but not in the positions they appeared in the guess ""CRANE"". Specifically, C is in the word but not in position 1, and E is in the word but not in position 5. The letters R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes both C and E (with C not in the first slot and E not in the last), and avoids R, A, N. “PECKS” fits perfectly:
- Contains C (position 3) and E (position 2), satisfying the placement constraints.
- Uses only letters P, E, C, K, S, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus “PECKS” is a good next guess.
