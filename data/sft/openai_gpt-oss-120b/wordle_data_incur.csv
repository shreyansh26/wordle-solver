### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word contains the letters C, R, and N, but not A or E. The positions are constrained: C is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4. I need a valid 5‑letter word that includes C, R, N in other positions and fills the remaining spots with letters that haven’t been ruled out. “SCORN” satisfies all these constraints (C is in position 2, R in position 4, N in position 5, and it adds S and O which are still possible).

We have the following constraints from previous feedbacks:

- Excluded letters: A, E, S, O.
- Position restrictions:
  * C not in positions 1, 2, or 5 → C can be 3 or 4.
  * R not in positions 1, 2, or 4 → R can be 3 or 5.
  * N not in positions 3, 4, or 5 → N can be 1 or 2.
  * U not in position 2.
  * I not in position 4.

The only common English word using exactly the letters I, N, C, U, R that fits all positional constraints is **INCUR** (I‑N‑C‑U‑R). This satisfies every restriction:
