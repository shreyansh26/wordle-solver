### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Given feedback from the first guess:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct and in the 4th position.

So the secret word has the form ***N* (letters 1‑3 unknown, 4 = N, 5 unknown) and must avoid the letters C, R, A, E entirely. 

Choosing a common five‑letter word that satisfies these constraints, “BOUND” fits:
- B, O, U, N, D are all allowed (none are C, R, A, E).
- N is in the 4th position as required.

Thus the next guess will be “BOUND”.

From the feedback:

- Letter D is also present (already satisfied at position 1).

- Letter N is in the word but not at position 3 (N(-) from DINKS), confirming its place at position 4.
- Letters C, R, A, E, B, O, U, K, S are ruled out.

Thus the pattern is D _ _ N _. I must be either at position 3 or 5. A common word fitting this pattern is “DYING” (D Y I N G), which respects all known constraints.
