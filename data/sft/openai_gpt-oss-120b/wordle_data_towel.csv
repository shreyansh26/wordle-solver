### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. It does contain an E, but the E is not in the fifth position (it was the last letter of “CRANE”). I need a new guess that obeys these constraints and places the E in a different spot to gain more information. A good candidate is “SHELF” – it has no forbidden letters, includes an E in the third position, and mixes several common letters.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, H, F are not in the word.
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a word using only allowed letters, placing E and L in permissible spots, and introducing new letters for more clues. “TILED” fits:
- Contains L at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed).
- Uses only letters T, I, D besides E and L, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus “TILED” is a valid next guess.
