### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"": R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5. The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all. We need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions and avoids the excluded letters. A good candidate is **SHRED**:
- R is at position 3 (allowed)
- E is at position 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters C, A, N appear.
This guess also introduces new letters S, H, and D to gather more information.

We have these deductions:
- The secret word has E in position 4 (from SHRED, where E was marked ✓).
- Letters R, S, and E are in the word.
- R is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and SHRED). So R can be position 1 or 5.
- S is NOT in position 1 (from SHRED). It can be positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, H, D (they received x).

Considering the pattern _ _ _ E _:
- If R is at position 5, we need S at position 2 or 3. A common word fitting this is **LOSER** (L O S E R): S is at position 3, R at 5, no forbidden letters.
- If R were at position 1, a candidate would be **ROBES**, but we’ll test one possibility first.

Choosing **LOSER** to test the R‑at‑5 scenario and introduce L and O.
