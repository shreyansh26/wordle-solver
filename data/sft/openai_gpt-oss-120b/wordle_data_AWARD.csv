### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Secret word has A at position 3 (A is correct).
- Letter R is in the word but not at position 2.
- Letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

We need a new guess that keeps A in the third slot, avoids C, N, E, and ideally includes R in a different position to pinpoint it. However, common words with A third and R not in position 2 are limited. Instead, we can choose a word that retains A third and tests new letters while still possibly containing R later. “SWAMP” fits: it has A in the third position, uses none of the excluded letters, and introduces S, W, M, P for more information.

Thus the next guess is:

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 is W (✓ from SWAMP).
- Position 3 is A (✓ from both guesses).
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 2 (from CRANE), so R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters excluded (known not to be in the word): C, N, E, S, M, P, and also the letters that were marked x in SWAMP: S, M, P (already covered). 

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ W A _ _. It must contain R somewhere other than position 2. A good candidate that respects all constraints is **DWARF** (D W A R F).
