### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first two letters are correct: C (position 1) and R (position 2). All other letters tried (A, N, E, O, S, U, M, B, Y, P, T) are not in the word. Remaining possible letters are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
We need a common 5‑letter word starting with “CR” that uses only those remaining letters.  
The word **CRICK** fits: C R I C K. It uses I and K, which have not been ruled out, and repeats C (which is allowed since we only know C is correct at position 1). This will test the new letters I, C (in a new position) and K.
