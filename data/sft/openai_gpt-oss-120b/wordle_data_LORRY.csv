### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, information‑rich five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it includes the letters C, R, N, and the two most frequent vowels A and E.

We know from the first guess:
- C, A, N, E are definitely NOT in the secret word.
- R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains the letter R in a different slot (positions 1,3,4, or 5).
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is **SHRUB**:
- Contains R in the 3rd position (different from the 2nd slot).
- Uses letters S, H, U, B, none of which have been ruled out yet.
- All letters are common and give us fresh information about their presence or absence.

Thus the next guess will be SHRUB.
