### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Letters that are not in the word: R, A, N, E, D, O, S, P, I.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form __CKY using only letters not excluded. The common English word “MUCKY” fits: M (allowed), U (allowed), C, K, Y. This satisfies all constraints.

We have determined the exact positions of most letters:

- Position 2 is U (from MUCKY feedback).
- Position 3 is C (from DOCKS feedback).
- Position 4 is K (from DOCKS feedback).
- Position 5 is Y (from PICKY and MUCKY feedback).

Thus the word pattern is _ U C K Y.

Letters ruled out (not in the word) are: R, A, N, E, D, O, S, P, I, M, plus any others seen as x. The remaining possible first letters are those not excluded, such as L, B, Y, etc.

Common English words fitting the pattern are:
- LUCKY
- BUCKY
- YUCKY

“LUCKY” is the most common and likely candidate, and it uses only allowed letters. I will guess that word.
