### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word does not contain the letters S, L, T, or E. The letter A is present, but it is not in the third position (the position it occupied in “SLATE”). I need a new five‑letter word that includes A in a different spot and avoids the excluded letters. “MANGO” fits these constraints: it’s a valid English word, contains A in the second position, and uses only letters M, N, G, O that have not been ruled out.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Excluded letters (not in the word): S, L, T, E, M, O.
- Letter A is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from MANGO feedback).
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in MANGO and got “-”).
- Letter G is in the word but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in MANGO and got “-”).

Thus:
- Position 2 = A.
- N can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- G can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter English word that respects these placements and avoids the excluded letters.  
“PAGAN” fits perfectly:
- P A G A N
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- G is at position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- N is at position 5 (allowed, not position 3).
- No excluded letters appear.

This guess also introduces a new letter P to test further possibilities.

Hence we guess “PAGAN”.
