### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (from SWAMP feedback)
- Position 3: A (from all guesses)

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, G, L, W, M, P (all marked x).  
From GLASS, S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5, confirming S cannot appear elsewhere.

Thus the secret word pattern is: S _ A _ _.  
We need letters for positions 2, 4, 5 that are not among the eliminated set and do not place another S at positions 4 or 5.

A common word fitting this pattern with unused letters is **SHAFT**:
- S (pos1, correct)
- H (new letter, allowed)
- A (pos3, correct)
- F (new letter, allowed)
- T (new letter, allowed)

All letters are permissible, and no prohibited letters are present. This guess will give information about H, F, and T.
