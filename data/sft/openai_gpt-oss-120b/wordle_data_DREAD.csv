### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback:
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C and N are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with R second, containing both A and E, placing A somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5. “ARMED” satisfies all conditions: A is at position 1, R at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5, and it contains no C or N.

- R is confirmed at position 2.
- D is confirmed at position 5.
- A is in the word but not at positions 1 or 3 → must be at position 4.
