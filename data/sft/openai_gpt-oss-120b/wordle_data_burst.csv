### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a solid opening guess that includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. A good first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains the vowel A and E, and the frequent consonants S, L, T. This should give useful information about the secret word's letters and positions.

We know from the first guess:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- L, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes S and T in different positions from the first guess and avoids L, A, E.  
A good candidate is **CRUST**:
- Contains S (position 4, acceptable) and T (position 5, acceptable).
- Uses new letters C, R, U which we have no information about yet.
- No prohibited letters L, A, E.

Thus we will guess “CRUST”.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 4 is S (✓) and position 5 is T (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- U is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters L, A, E, C are ruled out.

Thus the secret word looks like ___ST, with R and U somewhere in the first three positions (R not at 2, U not at 3). A word that satisfies all of these constraints is **BURST** (B‑U‑R‑S‑T):  
- S is still at position 4, T at 5 (matches).  
- U is at position 2 (allowed, since U only cannot be at 3).  
- R is at position 3 (allowed, since R only cannot be at 2).  
- B is a new letter, and none of the eliminated letters appear.

So “BURST” is a logical next guess.
