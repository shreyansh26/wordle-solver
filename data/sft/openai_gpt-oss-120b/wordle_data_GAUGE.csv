### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and a couple of vowels, which will give useful information for subsequent guesses. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E** and contains an **A** somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3). We must avoid using C, R, N in the next guess.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **BASTE**:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A at position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters B, S, T for more information.
- Uses no disallowed letters.

Thus the next guess is BASTE.
