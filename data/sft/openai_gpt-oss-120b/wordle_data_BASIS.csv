### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- M (allowed) at position 1
- A at position 2 (confirmed)
- F (allowed) at position 3

Thus “MAFIA” is a valid next guess.

- From PATIO: P, T, O are not in the word; A is correct in position 2; I is correct in position 4.
- From MAFIA: M, F are not in the word; A is correct in position 2; I is correct in position 4; the last A is present but not in position 5 (so A is not at position 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 4 is I (confirmed from PATIO and MAFIA).
- Position 5 is S (confirmed from HAJIS).
- The letter A does not appear in positions 3 or 5, and the second A in MAFIA showed A is not at position 5, which is already satisfied.
- Letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, D, L, Y, P, T, O, M, F, H, J, and the first A in CRANE (position 3) is ruled out.

Thus the secret word must follow the pattern: **_ A _ I S**.

We need a common English word fitting this pattern using only letters not excluded. “BASIS” (B A S I S) satisfies:

- A at position 2,
- S at position 3 (still possible, no restriction against S there),
