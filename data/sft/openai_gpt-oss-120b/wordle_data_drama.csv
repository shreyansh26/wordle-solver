### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ R A _ _. Candidates must avoid the excluded letters and cannot contain a second R or A.

Possible fits include:

- BRAVO (B R A V O) – also viable.

Choosing one that uses common letters and gives new information, I will try “TRAIL”.

Viable remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common English word of the form _ R A _ _. “BRAVO” (B‑R‑A‑V‑O) fits perfectly:
- B, V, O are all allowed and not yet tested.
- It follows the required pattern.
Thus “BRAVO” is a logical next guess to test three new letters.

- A is correct at position 3.
- Letters eliminated (not in the word): C, N, E, G, S, P, T, I, L, B, V, O.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R A _ _. Remaining possible letters for the other positions are those not eliminated: D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and any not yet tried).

We need a common English word fitting _ R A _ _. The word **FRAUD** (F R A U D) satisfies the pattern and uses only letters that have not been ruled out. It also introduces three new letters (F, U, D) to gather more information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
