### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter guess that avoids all of those letters. Choosing a word with common unused letters will give the most information. ""MIGHT"" contains M, I, G, H, T—all of which are not among the eliminated letters—so it’s a valid next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- B is correct in position 1.
- O is correct in position 3.
- Letters C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,L,W,S are not in the word.

Remaining possible letters are: D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and B, O which we already placed).

The pattern so far is **B _ O _ _**. To gather more info we should use a word that keeps B and O in the known spots and introduces new letters from the remaining pool. A good choice is **BOOZY**, which uses B (position 1), O (positions 2 and 3), and introduces Z and Y—both letters we have not tested yet. This will tell us whether the second position is also O and whether Z or Y belong in the word.
