### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess that uses common letters to gather useful information. A good opening word is “CRANE” because it contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E) and a mix of consonants and a vowel. This will help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first guess that:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are not in the word.

We need a new word that still contains C and R, but places them in different positions, and introduces new letters to test. “TORCH” puts R in position 3 and C in position 4, satisfying the constraints, and adds T, O, H for new information.

We know from feedback:
- R is correct at position 3.
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, and cannot be at position 3 (occupied by R). So C must be at position 2 or 5.
- Letters A, N, E, T, O, H are not in the word.

We need a word that has R in the 3rd slot, includes C in either 2nd or 5th slot, and uses only letters not ruled out. One common candidate is **SCRUB**:
- Pattern: S (pos1) C (pos2) R (pos3) U (pos4) B (pos5)
- C is at position 2 (allowed), R is at position 3 (confirmed), and none of the letters S, U, B have been excluded yet.

Thus “SCRUB” satisfies all current constraints and introduces new letters S, U, B for further testing.
