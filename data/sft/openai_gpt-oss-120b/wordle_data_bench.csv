### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

From the feedback on ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, and E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain **C** and **N**, exclude **R, A, E**, and place C somewhere in positions 2‑5 and N in positions 1‑3 or 5.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **SCION**:
- Contains C (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new positions.
- Uses only letters S, I, O besides C and N, none of which were ruled out.

Thus the next guess is ""SCION"".

We have two guesses and feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - C is in the word, wrong position (not 1).
   - N is in the word, wrong position (not 4).
   - R, A, E are not in the word.

2. SCION → S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)
   - C still wrong position (now not 2 either).
   - N still wrong position (now not 5 either).
   - S, I, O are not in the word.

So the secret word contains only the letters C and N from the guesses, plus three other letters that we haven't tested yet.  
Positional restrictions:
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

Possible placements:
- C in 3, 4, or 5.
- N in 1, 2, or 3 (but not the same slot as C).

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **UNCUT**:
- Positions: U 1, N 2, C 3, U 4, T 5.
- C is in position 3 (allowed), N is in position 2 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters (R, A, E, S, I, O) appear.
- Uses only new letters U and T besides C and N.

Thus “UNCUT” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback on ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, and E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain **C** and **N**, exclude **R, A, E**, and place C somewhere in positions 2‑5 and N in positions 1‑3 or 5.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **SCION**:
- Contains C (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new positions.
- Uses only letters S, I, O besides C and N, none of which were ruled out.

Thus the next guess is ""SCION"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two guesses and feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - C is in the word, wrong position (not 1).
   - N is in the word, wrong position (not 4).
   - R, A, E are not in the word.

2. SCION → S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)
   - C still wrong position (now not 2 either).
   - N still wrong position (now not 5 either).
   - S, I, O are not in the word.

So the secret word contains only the letters C and N from the guesses, plus three other letters that we haven't tested yet.  
Positional restrictions:
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

Possible placements:
- C in 3, 4, or 5.
- N in 1, 2, or 3 (but not the same slot as C).

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **UNCUT**:
- Positions: U 1, N 2, C 3, U 4, T 5.
- C is in position 3 (allowed), N is in position 2 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters (R, A, E, S, I, O) appear.
- Uses only new letters U and T besides C and N.

Thus “UNCUT” is a valid next guess.

We have determined from previous feedback that the secret word contains N, C, and H in the exact positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (from the guess LYNCH which gave ✓ for those letters).  
The remaining unknown letters are positions 1 and 2.  

The letters that are definitely NOT in the word are: R, A, S, I, O, U, T, L, Y, and also the second occurrence of U from UNCUT, etc.  

From the first guess CRANE we learned that E is present (dash means correct letter wrong position), just not at position 5. Therefore E can be used in the remaining slots.  

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ E N C H** and respects all constraints is **WENCH**:
- Position 1 = W (allowed, not excluded)
- Position 2 = E (allowed, and we know E is in the word but not at position 5)
- Positions 3‑5 = N C H (already confirmed correct)

Thus “WENCH” satisfies all known information and is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
