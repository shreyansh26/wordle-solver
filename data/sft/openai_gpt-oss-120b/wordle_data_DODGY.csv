### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. I must avoid those letters in the next guess. Choosing a common five‑letter word that uses only letters not yet ruled out will give new information. “GUILD” contains G, U, I, L, D – all of which are still possible, so it’s a good next guess.

""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give useful information about the secret word's letters and positions.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. I must avoid those letters in the next guess. Choosing a common five‑letter word that uses only letters not yet ruled out will give new information. “GUILD” contains G, U, I, L, D – all of which are still possible, so it’s a good next guess.

Guess 2: GUILD -> FEEDBACK: G(-) U(x) I(x) L(x) D(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two previous guesses:

1. CRANE → all letters marked x, so C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. GUILD → G(-), U(x), I(x), L(x), D(-).  
   - G is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - D is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - U, I, L are not in the word.

Thus the remaining possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five‑letter word that contains both G and D, places G somewhere other than the first position, and places D somewhere other than the fifth position.  
A valid common word meeting these constraints is **DOGGO** (D O G G O):  
- D is at position 1 (allowed).  
- G appears at positions 3 and 4 (neither is position 1).  
- The other letters (O) are still unknown and allowed.

This guess will test new positions for G and D while introducing the new letter O.

Guess 3: DOGGO -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(✓) G(-) G(✓) O(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From GUILD: G is in the word but not in position 1; U, I, L are not in the word; D is in the word but not in position 5.
- From DOGGO:
  - D is correct at position 1 (✓).
  - O is correct at position 2 (✓).
  - G at position 3 is wrong (‑) – confirming G is elsewhere.
  - G at position 4 is correct (✓).
  - O at position 5 is wrong (‑) – O appears elsewhere but not at position 5.

Thus we know the secret word pattern is:

1 D 2 O 3 _ 4 G 5 _

Letters already used: D, O, G. Positions 3 and 5 must be letters that are not C, R, A, N, E, U, I, L and not the excluded positions for G and O. A common English word fitting D O _ G _ is **DOGGY** (D O G G Y). This satisfies all constraints:
- Position 3 is G (‑) – G is not correct there, matching the feedback.
- Position 4 is G (✓) – correct.
- Position 5 is Y, a new letter not yet excluded.

Therefore, the next guess should be DOGGY.

We have deduced the secret word constraints from the feedback:

- Positions 1 and 2 are D and O respectively (both ✓).
- Position 4 is G (✓) and position 5 is Y (✓).
- Position 3 is not G (the feedback for G at position 3 was “-”, meaning G exists elsewhere, which is already satisfied by the G at position 4).  

Thus the pattern is D O _ G Y, with the third letter still unknown but must be a letter not previously ruled out.  

The common English word that fits this pattern is **DODGY** (D O D G Y). All previous feedback aligns with this word, so the next guess should be the solution.
