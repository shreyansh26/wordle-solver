### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must have N as the fourth letter, must contain R somewhere other than the second position, and must avoid C, A, and E. A good candidate fitting these constraints is **TORNY** (T‑O‑R‑N‑Y), which places R in position 3 and N in position 4, with none of the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C is not in the word, R is in the word but not at position 2, A is not in the word, N is correct at position 4, E is not in the word.
- From TORNY: T is not in the word, O is in the word but not at position 2, R is in the word but not at position 3, N is again correct at position 4, Y is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have N at the fourth position.
- Contain the letters R and O, with R not in positions 2 or 3 and O not in position 2.
- Exclude the letters C, A, E, T, Y (and also the already‑ruled‑out letters).

The only viable placement for R and O, given N is fixed at position 4, is:
- R at position 1 and O at position 5 → pattern **R _ _ N O**.

A common English word that fits this pattern and respects all exclusions is **RHINO** (R H I N O):
- N is at position 4.
- R is at position 1 (not 2 or 3).
- O is at position 5 (not 2).
- H and I are allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be “RHINO”.
