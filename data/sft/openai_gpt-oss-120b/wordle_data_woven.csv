### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that C, R, and A are not in the word. N and E are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (N is not fourth, E is not fifth).

From the feedback:

- Letters C, R, A, M, L, O are not in the word (x).

We need a 5‑letter word ending with N, containing E in a permissible slot, and avoiding the eliminated letters. “SHEEN” fits:
- Pattern S H E E N → N is at position 5.

- None of the disallowed letters appear.
Thus it will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting the known constraints.

We have determined from the feedback:
- N is confirmed at position 5.
- One E is confirmed at position 4.
- Another E cannot be at positions 2,3,5 (from previous '-' marks), leaving position 1 as the only possible place for the second E.
Thus the pattern is **E _ _ E N**.

All letters marked “x” are not in the word: C, R, A, M, L, O, S, H, Q, U.  
Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 3 are those not yet ruled out (B, D, F, G, I, J, K, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A common English word fitting the pattern **E _ _ E N** with allowed letters is **EIGEN** (E‑I‑G‑E‑N). This matches every previous clue:
- N at 5 (✓ in MELON, QUEEN, SHEEN)
- E at 4 (✓ in SHEEN, QUEEN)
- The other E at position 1 (explains the “-” marks for E in earlier guesses)

Therefore the next logical guess is the word “EIGEN”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
