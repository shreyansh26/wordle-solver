### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- S and L are not in the secret word.
- A, T, and E are in the word but are in the wrong spots.
  * A is not in position 3.
  * T is not in position 4.
  * E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains A, T, and E.
- Avoids S and L.
- Places A, T, E in positions different from those ruled out.

The word **TREAD** fits:
- Contains T, R, E, A, D (no S or L).
- T is in position 1 (allowed, not position 4).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, not position 5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, not position 3).

Thus TREAD is a valid next guess.

We have accumulated feedback:

- From guess 1 (SLATE): S and L are not in the word (x). A, T, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically:
  - A is not position 3.
  - T is not position 4.
  - E is not position 5.

- From guess 2 (TREAD): 
  - T is present but in the wrong spot (-), so T cannot be position 1.
  - R is correct (✓) → R is position 2.
  - E is correct (✓) → E is position 3.
  - A is correct (✓) → A is position 4.
  - D is not in the word (x).

Combining these:
- Position 2 = R (fixed)
- Position 3 = E (fixed)
- Position 4 = A (fixed)
- Position 5 cannot be S, L, D; T is still a required letter and cannot be positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (by previous clues), so T fits position 5.
- Position 1 must be a letter not previously ruled out (not S, L, D) and must complete a real English word.

Pattern so far: _ R E A T.

The common word that matches this pattern is **GREAT** (G at position 1, R E A T already placed). G has not been excluded, so GREAT is a valid next guess.

Thus the next guess should be GREAT.
