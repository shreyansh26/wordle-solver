### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and the vowel A, as well as the letter E at the end. This will give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from feedback:
- L is correct at position 2.
- S is in the word but not at position 1.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.
- A and T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern ? L ? ? ?, containing S and E in other positions, with no A or T.

""BLESS"" fits:
- B L E S S
- L is in position 2 (✓).
- S appears in positions 4 and 5, never in position 1 (‑).
- E is in position 3, not position 5 (‑).
- No A or T.

Thus ""BLESS"" is a valid next guess.

Letters not in the word: A, B, T.  
The letter S appears only once (position 4); the S at position 5 in the previous guess was marked wrong, so the word cannot have an S at position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form ? L E S ?. A common word matching this pattern and avoiding the excluded letters is **FLESH** (F L E S H). All letters are permissible and it fits the known pattern.
