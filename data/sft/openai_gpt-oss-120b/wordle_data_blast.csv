We have determined:
- Positions 2,3,4 are L, A, S respectively (all ✓).
- Position 1 cannot be G, F, C, R, N, H, D, Y, K, E (all marked x).
- Position 5 cannot be S (the second S got a – indicating S is elsewhere, not position 5) and also cannot be any of the letters marked x.
Thus the pattern is _ L A S _. Looking for a common 5‑letter word fitting this pattern using only unused letters.

""PLASM"" fits:
- P and M have not been ruled out.
- Pattern P L A S M matches the known letters.
- It's a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
