### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback on “SLATE”:
- S, A, T are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes L and E in different positions, avoids S, A, T, and introduces new letters to gather more information.  
“RILED” (R I L E D) satisfies these conditions:
- L is at position 3 (not position 2).
- E is at position 4 (not position 5).
- No prohibited letters S, A, T appear.
- Adds the new letters R, I, D for testing.

Thus “RILED” is a strong next guess.

We know:
- E is correct at position 4 (from RILED feedback).
- L is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses). Therefore L can be at position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters: S, A, T, R, I, D.

We need a word with E at position 4, L at position 1 or 5, and no excluded letters. “NOVEL” fits: N O V E L (E at 4, L at 5) and uses only new letters N, O, V that haven’t been tested yet.

Thus we guess NOVEL.
