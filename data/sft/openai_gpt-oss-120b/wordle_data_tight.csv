### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE eliminated the letters C, R, A, N, and E from the secret word. For the next guess I should choose a common word that uses none of those letters and introduces as many new letters as possible to gather more information. The word “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, and T, all of which are still unknown and do not overlap with the eliminated letters. This should give a good spread for the next round of feedback.

We have the pattern from the second guess:

- Position 3 (G) is correct.
- Position 4 (H) is correct.
- Position 5 (T) is correct.
- Position 1 is not M and cannot be any of the letters eliminated in the first guess (C, R, A, N, E).

Thus the secret word is of the form _IGHT, where the first letter is not M, C, R, A, N, or E. Viable English words fitting this pattern are:
- LIGHT
- SIGHT
- FIGHT

We need a new guess that tests the remaining possibilities. Guessing “SIGHT” will tell us if the first letter is S; if it’s not, we’ll know the answer must be LIGHT or FIGHT, which we can resolve in subsequent attempts.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 4 (H) is correct.
- Position 5 (T) is correct.
- Position 1 is not M and cannot be any of the letters eliminated in the first guess (C, R, A, N, E).

Thus the secret word is of the form _IGHT, where the first letter is not M, C, R, A, N, or E. Viable English words fitting this pattern are:
- LIGHT
- SIGHT
- FIGHT

We need a new guess that tests the remaining possibilities. Guessing “SIGHT” will tell us if the first letter is S; if it’s not, we’ll know the answer must be LIGHT or FIGHT, which we can resolve in subsequent attempts.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _IGHT with positions 2‑5 confirmed as I‑G‑H‑T. The first letter cannot be M, C, R, A, N, E, S, L, F (all marked x). Remaining viable English words fitting the pattern are NIGHT, RIGHT, TIGHT, BIGHT, WIGHT, DIGHT, etc. The most common among these are NIGHT, RIGHT, and TIGHT. Choosing the most likely common word maximizes our chance of winning on the final try. Therefore, I will guess “NIGHT”.
