### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, A, and E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Includes R and N (to test their correct spots).
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2 and N somewhere other than position 4.
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

The word “RINKS” satisfies all conditions:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3), avoiding the forbidden spots.
- Introduces new letters I, K, S, none of which have been eliminated.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE):
  - C, A, E are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.

- From guess 2 (RINKS):
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.
  - I, K are not in the word.
  - N is in the word but not in position 3.
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **R, N, S** and exclude **C, A, E, I, K**.  
Positional constraints:
- R ≠ 1,2
- N ≠ 3,4
- S ≠ 5

A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces two new letters is **SNORT**:
- Positions: S(1) N(2) O(3) R(4) T(5)
- R is at position 4 (allowed), N at 2 (allowed), S at 1 (allowed, not 5).
- New letters O and T are not excluded.

Therefore SNORT is a valid next guess.
