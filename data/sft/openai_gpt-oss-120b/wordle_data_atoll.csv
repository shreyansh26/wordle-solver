### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- 'S' and 'E' are not in the secret word.
- 'L', 'A', and 'T' are in the word but each is in the wrong position from SLATE (so L ≠ position 2, A ≠ position 3, T ≠ position 4).

We need a new word that:
1. Includes L, A, T (so we can confirm their correct spots).
2. Places them in different positions than those ruled out.
3. Avoids the letters S and E.
4. Introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **LATIN**:
- L is at position 1 (allowed, not position 2).
- A is at position 2 (allowed, not position 3).
- T is at position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- Introduces new letters I and N for further clues.
- Contains no S or E.

Thus the next guess is LATIN.

We have confirmed that the letters L, A, and T are in the secret word, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in the first two guesses.

Constraints:
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions: 3, 4, 5
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): S, E, I, N

A word that satisfies all these constraints and introduces a new letter is **ATOLL**:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- T in position 2 (allowed)
- L in positions 4 and 5 (both allowed)
- O is a new test letter
- No eliminated letters are used

Thus ATOLL is a valid next guess.
