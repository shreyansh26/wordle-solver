### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess SLATE that the letters S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was marked “-” in SLATE). Therefore, in the next guess we must:

- Avoid using S, L, A, T.
- Include the letter E, but place it somewhere other than the 5th spot.
- Introduce new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **COVER**:
- It contains E in the 4th position (different from the 5th spot in SLATE).
- It avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
- It adds the new letters C, O, V, and R for further information.

Thus, the next guess will be “COVER”.

- Position 4: E is correct (✓).
