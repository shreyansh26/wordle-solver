### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful feedback. ""SLATE"" includes the frequent letters S, L, A, T, and E, giving a broad coverage of possible letters.

All letters from the first guess (S, L, A, T, E) are excluded. I need a new five‑letter word that does not contain any of those letters. Choosing commonly used letters like C, H, O, R, D gives the word “CHORD”, which satisfies the constraint.

We have eliminated letters S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, D from the secret word. The letter R is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 4 (the fourth position of CHORD). Therefore we need a five‑letter word using only the remaining letters {B, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} with R placed somewhere other than the fourth slot. A common word that fits these constraints is **BRINK** (B‑R‑I‑N‑K), where R is in the second position.
