### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that the final letter is E (✓) and the letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. So the secret word ends with E and must avoid those four letters. I’ll choose a common word that fits the pattern __ __ __ __ E and uses different letters. “SLIDE” (S‑L‑I‑D‑E) meets those criteria.

We have the following feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is correct in position 5.
- Guess 2 (SLIDE): S, L, D are not in the word; I is in the word but not in position 3; E is confirmed in position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E**, contains the letter **I** somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, S, L, D.

Looking for a common 5‑letter word that fits:
- Ends with E.
- Includes I (not in the 3rd spot).
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

The word **PIXIE** satisfies all constraints:
- Pattern: P I X I E (ends with E).
- I appears in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).
- Contains only the allowed letters P, I, X, E.

Thus, PIXIE is a valid next guess.
