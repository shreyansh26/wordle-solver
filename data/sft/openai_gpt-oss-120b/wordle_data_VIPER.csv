# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have gathered the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters (marked x):** A, C, L, M, N, O, S, T, U  
- **Letters that must be in the word (marked - or ✓):** R, E, I, P  

Confirmed positions from ✓ feedback:
- Position 3 = P
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

From the - feedback we know:
- R is not in positions 1‑3
- E is not in positions 2 or 5
- I is in the word but not in position 4
- P is in the word but not in position 2

Thus the only open spots are positions 1 and 2, and they must accommodate the remaining required letters I and a new letter that isn’t excluded.  
A valid English word fitting the pattern **_ I P E R** is **VIPER** (V I P E R), which uses only allowed letters and satisfies all positional constraints.

So the next guess is:
