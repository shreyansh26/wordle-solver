# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

“RILED” fits:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 4 (still a “‑” because we haven’t placed it correctly yet)
- Introduces I, L, D, none of which have been eliminated.

Thus this is a good next guess.

- R is correct at position 1.
- E is in the word but not at positions 2 (from REBUT) or 5 (from CRANE). So E can be at position 3 or 4.
- Letters C, A, N, B, U, T are not in the word.

We need three more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Choosing a word with R in the first slot and E in the fourth slot gives us useful new letters to test.

“RILED” fits:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 4 (still a “‑” because we haven’t placed it correctly yet)
- Introduces I, L, D, none of which have been eliminated.

Thus this is a good next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1: R (✓)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

Thus the word must be of the form **R I _ E R**. The only unknown is the third letter. All letters that have been marked “x” (C, A, N, B, U, T, L, D, P) are not possible. Remaining letters such as V, M, etc., are still viable. The common English word **RIVER** fits the pattern (R I V E R) and introduces V, a letter not yet tried. It satisfies all known constraints, so it is a logical next guess.
