### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From previous feedback:
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, U, G, M.
- Correct placements: R at position 2, O at positions 3 and 4.
- Letters present but misplaced: P (not position 1), D (not position 5).

Since the word pattern is _ R O O _, the only places left are positions 1 and 5.
P cannot go in position 1, so it must be in position 5.
D cannot be in position 5, so it must be in position 1.

Thus the word is **DROOP**, which fits all constraints.
