### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- The letters S and A are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guess SLATE.
  • S is NOT in position 1.
  • A is NOT in position 3.
- L and T are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E, containing both A and S, without L or T, and respecting the position restrictions.

A good candidate is **ARISE**:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 1, allowed) and S (position 4, allowed).
- No L or T.

Thus ARISE satisfies all current constraints.
