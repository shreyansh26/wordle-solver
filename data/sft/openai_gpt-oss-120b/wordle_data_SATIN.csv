### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (as they appeared in CRANE).

I can now choose a new word that avoids C, R, and E, and either keeps A and N in different positions to test them further, or completely omits A and N to test other letters. 

Choosing a word without A or N lets me probe new letters while respecting the known constraints. “SHOUT” contains none of the excluded letters (C, R, E) and introduces S, H, O, U, T for testing.

Thus, my next guess is:

We have:
- Position 1 must be S (✓ from SHOUT).
- Letters A, N, T are in the word but not in their previous positions: A not in position 3, N not in position 4, T not in position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, H, O, U.
We need a 5‑letter word starting with S that contains A, N, T in the remaining spots and obeys the position constraints.
The word “SATIN” fits:
S (position 1) ✓
A at position 2 (not 3) ✔
T at position 3 (not 5) ✔
I is a new allowed letter.
N at position 5 (not 4) ✔
All excluded letters are avoided.
