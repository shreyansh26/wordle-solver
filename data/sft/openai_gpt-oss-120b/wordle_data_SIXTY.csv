### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the confirmed pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: S (green)
- Position 2: I (green)
- Position 4: T (green)
- Position 5: Y (green)
- Position 3 is still unknown; F was tried and was marked as not in the word.

All letters that have been ruled out so far: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, H, P, F, plus any other letters from prior ""x"" feedback. The remaining alphabet letters are viable for position 3.

A common English word that fits the pattern S I _ T Y and uses an allowed letter at position 3 is **SIXTY** (with X in the third slot). X has not been eliminated, so this guess will test the final unknown letter.

Thus we guess SIXTY.
