### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the secret word must contain an A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, R, N, E. Choose a common word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to test. ""SALAD"" fits: it has A in positions 2 and 4, and uses new letters S, L, D which have not been ruled out.

We have:
- From CRANE: C,R,N,E are not in the word; A is present but not in position 3.
- From SALAD: A at position 4 is correct; the other A (position 2) is wrong; L is in the word but not at position 3; S and D are not in the word.

Thus the secret word:
- Has A at the fourth slot.
- Contains L somewhere other than the third slot (so L can be 1, 2, or 5).
- Contains no letters C, R, N, E, S, D.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **TOTAL** (T O T A L):
- A is at position 4.
- L is at position 5 (not position 3).
- No prohibited letters appear.

So the next guess will be TOTAL.
