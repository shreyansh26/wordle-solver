### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving a broad coverage for the feedback.

We know:

- C is in the word but not in position 1, so C must be in position 2 or 4.
- R and N are not in the word at all.

“PLACE” fits perfectly:

We have determined the known positions:
- Position 3 = A (from both guesses)
- Position 4 = C (confirmed from PLACE)
- Position 5 = E (confirmed from both)

From the second guess (PLACE):
- P is present but not in position 1, leaving position 2 as the only open slot for P. So position 2 = P.

Thus the word pattern is _ P A C E.
