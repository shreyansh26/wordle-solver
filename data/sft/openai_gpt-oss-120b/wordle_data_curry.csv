### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give useful information. ""CRANE"" is frequently used for its diverse letters (C, R, A, N, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct). The letter R is in the word but not in position 2, so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word beginning with C, containing R somewhere other than the second slot, and avoiding A, N, E.

Possible candidates: **CURLY** (C‑U‑R‑L‑Y) fits all constraints: starts with C, has R in position 3, and uses none of the excluded letters.
