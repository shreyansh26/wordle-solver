### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter I is confirmed to be correct and in the second position.

So the secret word must have I as the second letter and cannot contain any of the excluded letters. Remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter word fitting the pattern _ I _ _ _. One valid candidate using only allowed letters is **DISKS** (D‑I‑S‑K‑S). All its letters are permissible, and it keeps I in the correct spot.
