### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain S, L, T, or E. The letter A is present but is not in the third position (the position it occupied in “SLATE”). Therefore, our next guess should:
- Include the letter A in a different position (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid using S, L, T, E to prevent unnecessary repeats.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **MANGO**:

Thus:
- Position 4 = A.
- N must be somewhere other than positions 2, 3, or 4 → possible positions are 1 or 5.
- Remaining letters must come from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones (S, L, T, E, M, G, O, U, C, P) and should not repeat known wrong placements.

Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(-) G(-) O(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, M, G, O.
- Letters present but misplaced: A (not in positions 2 or 3), N (not in position 3).

We need a new guess that includes A and N in still‑possible positions and introduces fresh letters to test.  
Choosing the word **UNCAP**:
- A is placed at position 4 (allowed).
- N is placed at position 2 (allowed).
- New letters U, C, P have not been tested yet and are not among the eliminated letters.
Thus this guess satisfies all constraints and will give us more information.

Guess 3: UNCAP -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) C(x) A(✓) P(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback so far:
- From SLATE: only A is present, but not in position 3.
- From MANGO: A is also not in position 2, and N is present but not in position 3.
- From UNCAP: A is confirmed in position 4 (✓). N is present but not in position 2 (‑). All other letters used are confirmed absent.

Thus:
- Position 4 = A.
- N must be somewhere other than positions 2, 3, or 4 → possible positions are 1 or 5.
- Remaining letters must come from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones (S, L, T, E, M, G, O, U, C, P) and should not repeat known wrong placements.

A common English word satisfying these constraints is **DIVAN**:
- Pattern: D I V A N → A is in position 4, N is in position 5 (allowed).
- Letters D, I, V have not been used yet and are not among the eliminated letters.

Therefore, DIVAN is a logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
