### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From previous feedback:

- R is correct at position 5, and there is another R somewhere else (since the first R got a “-” indicating it’s in the word but not at position 1).

We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:

- Position 2 is O (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 4 is E (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 5 is R (✓ from guess 2).
- Letters C, A, N, G, S are not in the word (x marks).
- The first R (position 1 in guess 2) got “‑”, meaning R is in the word but not at position 1; since R is already correct at position 5, the extra “‑” simply reflects that the extra R in the guess isn’t in the right spot. Thus the secret likely contains only one R at position 5.

So the current pattern is: **_ O _ E R**.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching that pattern and avoiding the excluded letters. Good candidates are:
- LO V E R
- JO K E R
- HO V E R
- MO V E R
- FO L E R (but L is okay, F okay)

- Contains R (positions 1 and 5, both not 2) and E (position 4, not 5).
- Uses only allowed letters (R, O, G, E) and adds new letters O and G for further testing.
Thus, “ROGER” is a solid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roger -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From previous feedback:
- C, A, N, G are not in the word.
- O is correct at position 2.
- E is correct at position 4.
- R is correct at position 5, and there is another R somewhere else (since the first R got a “-” indicating it’s in the word but not at position 1).
Thus the pattern is _ O _ E R with another R not at position 1, leaving position 3 as the only place for the second R.  
A word fitting this pattern and using allowed letters is **SORER** (S O R E R). It satisfies all known constraints and tests the remaining unknown letter S.

Guess 2: roger -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: sorer -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) R(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:

- Position 2 is O (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 4 is E (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 5 is R (✓ from guess 2).
- Letters C, A, N, G, S are not in the word (x marks).
- The first R (position 1 in guess 2) got “‑”, meaning R is in the word but not at position 1; since R is already correct at position 5, the extra “‑” simply reflects that the extra R in the guess isn’t in the right spot. Thus the secret likely contains only one R at position 5.

So the current pattern is: **_ O _ E R**.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching that pattern and avoiding the excluded letters. Good candidates are:
- LO V E R
- JO K E R
- HO V E R
- MO V E R
- FO L E R (but L is okay, F okay)

Choosing a word that tests new letters while fitting the pattern, “HOVER” introduces H and V, both untested and plausible. It respects all known constraints.

Thus the next guess will be **HOVER**.

A common word that satisfies the pattern and brings new letters J and K is **JOKER**.
