### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I'll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good initial guess because it uses three frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give a broad spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word's pattern from the feedback:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 3 is A (correct).
- Position 4 is N (correct).
- Position 1 cannot be C.
- Position 5 cannot be E.

Thus the word looks like _ R A N _. A common English word fitting this pattern is **GRANT**. It introduces new letters G and T while keeping the confirmed letters in place and avoids the excluded letters C and E.

We know the secret word pattern is _ R A N _. From the feedback:
- Position 2 = R (correct)
- Position 3 = A (correct)
- Position 4 = N (correct)
- Position 1 cannot be C or G
- Position 5 cannot be E or T

So we need a common English word of the form ?RAN?. Viable options include BRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK, etc. BRAND fits the pattern, uses new letters B and D, and respects the exclusions (B and D are not yet ruled out). I’ll guess BRAND.
