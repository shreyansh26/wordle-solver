The feedback shows that the secret word ends with E and does not contain the letters C, R, A, or N anywhere. I need a new 5‑letter word that ends in E and introduces new letters to test. “SLIDE” fits: it ends with E and uses the new letters S, L, I, D, which haven’t been ruled out yet.

From previous feedback:
- Word ends with E and starts with S.
- L, C, R, A, N, D are not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in position 3; possible positions are 2 or 4.
A word fitting the pattern S _ _ _ E with I in position 2 is **SIEVE** (S I E V E). It satisfies all constraints and uses new letters.
