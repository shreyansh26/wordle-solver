### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess eliminated the letters C, R, A, N, and E entirely. I need to pick a new 5‑letter word that does not contain any of those letters. Choosing a word with a mix of common consonants and at least one vowel will give good information. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T—none of which have been ruled out—so it’s a solid next guess.

We have feedback:
- From ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From ""MIGHT"": M, G, H are not in the word; I is in the word but not in position 2; T is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ _ T, with I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and none of the eliminated letters may appear.

We need a new guess that:
- Ends with T,
- Contains I (not in position 2),
- Uses letters not yet eliminated,
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SPILT**:
- Positions: S(1) P(2) I(3) L(4) T(5)
- I is at position 3 (allowed),
- Adds new letters S, P, L for testing,
- All letters are allowed (none are eliminated).
