We know from feedback that the secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position. Letters C, R, and E are not present anywhere. So the pattern is __ A N _. I need a new five‑letter word that matches this pattern and uses letters other than C, R, E for the remaining spots. “PLANT” fits: P (position 1), L (position 2), A (✓), N (✓), T (position 5).

- Position 4: N (✓)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the secret word (from X marks): C, R, E, P, T, S, G.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ L A N _. The remaining unknown letters are in positions 1 and 5, and they must not be any of the excluded letters.

Possible words that match the pattern and avoid the excluded letters include:
- BLANK (B _ L A N K)
- FLANK (F L A N K)
- CLANS (C is excluded, so no)
- SLANT (S and T are excluded)
- PLANK (P excluded)

Both BLANK and FLANK are viable candidates. Choosing FLANK introduces a new letter (F) that we haven't tested yet and keeps K in position 5, which hasn't been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess will be FLANK.

We have confirmed positions:
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (from X marks): C, R, E, P, T, S, G, F, K.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern ""_ L A N _"" with only the first and fifth letters unknown, and they must not be any of the excluded letters.

Candidates that match this pattern and avoid the excluded letters include:
- **BLAND** (B L A N D) – B and D have not been tried and are not excluded.
- **CLANS** (C excluded) – not allowed.
- **FLANS** (F and S excluded) – not allowed.
- **GLAND** (G excluded) – not allowed.
- **PLANK** (P and K excluded) – not allowed.
- **SLANT** (S and T excluded) – not allowed.
- **BLANK** (K excluded) – not allowed.

The only viable common English word is **BLAND**, which introduces two new letters (B and D) and respects all known constraints. This will help determine the correct first and last letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be BLAND.
