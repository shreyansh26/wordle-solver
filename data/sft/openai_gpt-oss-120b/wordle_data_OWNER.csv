2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- O cannot be in position 2.

All other positions are currently unrestricted.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing R, O, N, respecting those position rules, and using two other letters that aren’t excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- C, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and places R and N in different positions than those ruled out.  
A good candidate is **ROBIN**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2).
- N is in position 5 (allowed, not position 4).
- The other letters O, B, I are not excluded.

Thus we will guess “ROBIN”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ROBIN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have these constraints from feedback:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, E, B, I.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, N.

Positional constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

All other positions are currently unrestricted.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing R, O, N, respecting those position rules, and using two other letters that aren’t excluded.

The word **SNORT** fits:
- S (pos1) – allowed.
- N (pos2) – N is allowed here (not 4 or 5).
- O (pos3) – O is allowed (not pos2).
- R (pos4) – R is allowed (not 1 or 2).
- T (pos5) – allowed.

All constraints are satisfied, and the word is a valid English term.

Thus the next guess is SNORT.
