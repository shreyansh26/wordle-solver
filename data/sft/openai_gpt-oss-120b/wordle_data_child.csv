2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The first letter is confirmed as C. Letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. I need a new word starting with C that avoids those letters and introduces new common letters, especially vowels, to gather more information. “CLOUT” satisfies these conditions: it starts with C, contains no R, A, N, or E, and introduces the letters L, O, U, and T for testing.

We know:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- Letters R, A, N, E, O, U, T are not in the word (x).

We need a 5‑letter word starting with C, containing L somewhere other than the second spot, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
""CHILD"" fits:
- Starts with C.
- Contains L at position 4 (not position 2).
- Uses only letters C, H, I, L, D, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it is a good next guess.
