### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain the letters C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position (where it appeared in “CRANE”). Therefore the next guess should include A in a different spot and avoid the excluded letters. A common word that fits these constraints is “SALTY”, placing A in the second position and using only new letters.

We have feedback:
- C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Thus the secret word must contain A in position 1, 4, or 5, and all other letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Choosing a common word that fits these constraints will give us more information. “AUDIO” places A in position 1 and uses only letters (U, D, I, O) that have not been ruled out.
