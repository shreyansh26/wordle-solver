### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word does NOT contain S, L, A, or E. It does contain the letter T, but T is NOT in the fourth position (the position it occupied in “SLATE”). Therefore my next guess must include T in a different position and avoid the letters S, L, A, E. I’ll choose a word that introduces new letters and places T elsewhere, e.g., “CRUFT”, which puts T at the end (position 5) and uses C, R, U, F – all letters not yet ruled out.

We know from the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, E, C, R, U are not in the secret word.
- Letter T is correct and in position 5.
- Letter F is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ T, with an F somewhere in positions 1‑3.

For the next guess I will keep T in the fifth position, avoid all letters known to be absent, and introduce new letters to learn more about the word. “MIGHT” satisfies these constraints (M, I, G, H are all still possible letters, and T is correctly placed). It does not contain any eliminated letters and will give information about the remaining positions.
