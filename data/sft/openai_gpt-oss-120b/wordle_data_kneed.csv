### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which will give useful information about the secret word.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Thus possible positions:
- N can be at 1, 2, or 5.
- E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

We need a new word that includes both N and E in allowed spots and introduces new letters to test.  
The word **ELFIN** places E at position 1 (allowed) and N at position 5 (allowed). The remaining letters L, F, I have not been tried yet, giving us new information.

Therefore the next guess is ELFIN.

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, M, D, S, L, F, I.

- E is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 → E can be at position 3 or 4.

Thus the secret word must have N at position 1 or 2 and E at position 3 or 4, with all other letters coming from the unused set {B, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is **ONEUP**:
- O (new letter)
- N at position 2 (allowed)
- E at position 3 (allowed)
- U (new letter)
- P (new letter)

All letters are unused and the pattern matches the known placements.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need to incorporate all feedback correctly, noting that '-' indicates the letter is in the word but in a different position.

From guesses:
1. CRANE: N(-) and E(-) => N and E are in the word, not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. MENDS: E(-), N(-), D(-) => E, N, D are in the word, not in positions 2,3,4 respectively. M and S are absent.
3. ELFIN: E(-), N(-) => E and N are in the word, not in positions 1 and 5 respectively. L, F, I absent.

- Remaining letters in the word are D (from guess2) and possibly others, but D cannot be in positions 2,3,4 (ruled out) and pos1 is K, so D must be at position 5.
