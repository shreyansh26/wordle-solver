### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular first guess in Wordle because it covers two vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N). This should give a good spread of feedback.

We know from the first guess that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since it got a “-” in CRANE). Therefore the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include an E in one of the first four positions.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “MOTEL”: it contains E in position 4, and introduces M, O, T, L, none of which have been ruled out yet.
