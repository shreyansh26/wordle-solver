### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct at position 5.

So the secret word ends with E, contains A somewhere other than the third slot, and does not contain C, R, or N. I’ll choose a word that satisfies these constraints and uses new letters to gain more information. “PAUSE” fits: it ends with E, places A in position 2, and introduces P, U, S for testing.

Current constraints:

- No other letters have been identified yet.

We need a word that ends with E, contains A in position 1 or 4, and avoids the forbidden letters. A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints and introduces three new letters for testing is **ALIVE**:

- Ends with E.
