### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) placed in different positions.

The feedback from the first guess tells us:
- Letter C is not in the word.
- Letter R is correct and in position 2.
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters N and E are not in the word.

So the secret word must have **R at the second slot** and contain an **A somewhere other than the third position**. It must avoid C, N, and E.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **AROMA**:
- It places A at position 1 (and also at position 5, which is fine).
- R is correctly placed at position 2.
- It introduces new letters O and M for further testing.
- It contains no prohibited letters (C, N, E).

Thus the next guess will be “AROMA”.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 1 = A (✓ from guess 2)
- Position 2 = R (✓ from both guesses)
- Letter O is in the word but **not** in position 3 (O got “-” in guess 2)
- Letters C, N, E, M are not in the word (all got “x”)
- Position 3 cannot be A (A was “-” in guess 1) and cannot be O (O was “-” in guess 2)
- Position 5 is not A (the second A in guess 2 got “-”, meaning the correct A is elsewhere)

The simplest way to test the remaining unknown slots is to try a common word that fits the known pattern **A R _ _ _**, uses O in a new position, and introduces new letters we haven’t tested yet.

“ARROW” matches the pattern, places O at position 4 (different from the prohibited position 3), adds a second R at position 3 and a new letter W at position 5, all of which are still unknown. This guess will confirm whether the secret word follows this layout.

Therefore the next guess is:
