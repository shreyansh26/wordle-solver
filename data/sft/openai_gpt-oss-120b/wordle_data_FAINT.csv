### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have the feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- N is correct in the 4th position.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word must have:
- N at position 4.
- An A somewhere except position 3.
- No C, R, or E anywhere.

We need a common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints. “TAUNT” satisfies them:
- Letters: T A U N T
- N is in the 4th slot.
- A is in the 2nd slot (not the 3rd).
- It contains none of the excluded letters C, R, E.

Thus “TAUNT” is a valid next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Position 2 is A (green).
- Position 4 is N (green).
- Position 5 is T (green).
- The letter T also appears elsewhere (yellow on the first T), so the word contains a second T that is not in position 1. The only remaining spot for that second T is position 3.

Thus the pattern is **_ A T N T**, but we are not yet sure about the first letter and whether position 3 is definitely T. To gather more information, we can guess a common word that satisfies the confirmed letters and tests a new letter in position 3. The word **SAINT** (S A I N T) fits the known greens and introduces I at position 3 while keeping only one T at the end, which will let us see if the hidden T belongs at position 3 or if another letter is there.

So the next guess is “SAINT”.
