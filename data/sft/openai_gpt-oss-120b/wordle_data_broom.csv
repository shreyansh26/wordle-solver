### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it includes the vowels A and E and the frequent consonants C, R, and N. This will help identify which of those letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know the secret word has R as the second letter (R is correct). The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new guess that keeps R in the second position and tests new letters while avoiding the eliminated ones. A good candidate is ""DRIFT"": D R I F T.

We have the following confirmed letters and positions:

- Position 1: B (✓ from BROOK)
- Position 2: R (✓ from all guesses)
- Position 3: O (✓ from PROWL and BROOK)
- Position 4: O (✓ from BROOK)
- Position 5: unknown; K was guessed and got x, so the final letter is not K.

Eliminated letters (not in the word at all): C, A, N, E, D, I, F, T, P, W, L, K.

The remaining unused letters that could fill the last slot are: G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a common English word matching the pattern **B R O O _** with a permissible final letter, the word **BROOM** fits perfectly (final letter M, which hasn't been ruled out).

Thus the next guess should be “BROOM”.
