We know from feedback:
- I is correct at position 2.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- D is in the word but not in position 4, so it can be at 1, 3, or 5.
All other letters tried (C,R,A,N,E,S,H,O,U,T,B,M,P,W,Y) are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word using only the remaining letters {D,F,G,J,K,L,Q,V,X,Z} plus I (already placed).  
A word that satisfies the placement constraints is **LIVID**:
- L at position 1 (allowed)
- I at position 2 (✓)
- V at position 3 (new test letter, allowed)
- I at position 4 (allowed; repeats of I are fine)
- D at position 5 (allowed, D is present but not position 4)

""LIVID"" fits all known constraints and introduces a new letter V for further information.
