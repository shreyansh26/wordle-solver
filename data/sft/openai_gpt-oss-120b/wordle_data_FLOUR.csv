### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains frequent letters, giving me useful information for subsequent guesses. “CRANE” is a good starter: it includes three of the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both a vowel (A, E) and consonants. This should reveal useful feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the first guess CRANE that the letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. Therefore our next guess should:
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Include R in a position other than the second.
- Use other common letters to gather more info.
A good candidate is **STORM**: it contains R in the fourth slot (different from position 2) and uses letters S, T, O, M which have not been ruled out.

From CRANE we know C, A, N, E are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 2.  
From STORM we know S, T, M are not in the word; O is correct at position 3; R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was marked “-”).  

Thus O must be at position 3, and R can only be at position 1 or 5.  
All other letters used so far are ruled out.  

A word that satisfies these constraints is **FLOUR**:
- O is in the 3rd spot.
- R is in the 5th spot.
- None of the letters F, L, U have been eliminated.

So FLOUR is a valid next guess.
