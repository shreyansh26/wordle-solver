### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is correct and in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is _ _ A _ _. E must be in position 1, 2, or 4. We need a common word that fits, avoids C, R, N, and places E correctly. “LEAST” (L E A S T) satisfies:
- A is third.
- E is second (not fifth).
- No C, R, or N.
Thus it’s a good next guess.

We have:
- Position 2 is E (from LEAST feedback).
- Position 3 is A (from both guesses).
- Letters not in word: C, R, N, L, S, T.
- E is not in position 5 (from first guess), so E must stay at position 2.

We need a common 5‑letter word matching pattern _ E A _ _. 
Candidates avoiding the forbidden letters include:
- HEAVY (H E A V Y)
- BEADY (B E A D Y)
- PEAKY (P E A K Y)

All satisfy the known constraints. “HEAVY” is a frequent word and uses only allowed letters, so it’s a good next guess.
