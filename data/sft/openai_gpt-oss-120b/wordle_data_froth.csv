### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a solid opening guess that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" includes two common vowels (A, E) and frequently used consonants (S, L, T), which should give useful initial feedback.

We know from the first guess that the fourth letter is T and that S, L, A, and E are not in the word at all. So the secret word fits the pattern ___T_. I need a new valid 5‑letter word with T in the fourth position and none of the forbidden letters. “FORTY” (F O R T Y) satisfies those constraints and introduces new letters to test.

We know:
- Position 1 = F (from first letter of FORTY, which was correct).
- Position 4 = T (from both guesses).
- Letters O and R are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in FORTY: O is not in position 2, R is not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, E, Y.

We need a word of form F _ _ T _. O must go in position 3 or 5, R must go in position 2 or 5 (but not both in same spot). The word **FROTH** fits:
- F at 1 (✓)
- R at 2 (allowed)
- O at 3 (allowed)
- T at 4 (✓)
- H at 5 (new letter, not excluded)

Thus “FROTH” satisfies all known constraints and tests new letters.
