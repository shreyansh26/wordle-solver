### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess of a 5‑letter English word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information. “CRANE” is a good starter because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both frequent consonants and vowels.

From previous feedback:
- Letters C,R,A,N,E,M,G are not in the word.
- I is correct at position 2.
- H is in the word but not at position 4.
- T is in the word but not at position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with I as the second letter, containing H and T in other positions (H ≠ 4, T ≠ 5). The word “FILTH” fits:
- Pattern F I L T H → I is at position 2.
- H is at position 5 (allowed) and T at position 4 (allowed).
- None of the excluded letters appear.

Thus “FILTH” is a valid next guess.
