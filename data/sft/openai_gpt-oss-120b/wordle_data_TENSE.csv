### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- E is correct in position 5.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **N** somewhere in positions 1‑3, and must avoid C, R, A.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints and gives us more information. A good candidate is **MUNGE**:
- Ends with E (matches the known correct position).
- Places N in position 3 (different from the forbidden position 4).
- Uses letters M, U, G that we haven't tested yet.

This guess will tell us whether N belongs in position 3 and reveal the presence/absence of M, U, G.
