### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 2 is A (correct).
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- Letters C, R, N, P, S, T are not in the word.

We have gathered all feedback:

- Pattern is _ A _ _ E (A in position 2, E in position 5).
- B is in the word but not in position 3 (from FABLE feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, P, S, T, W, I, V, F, L (all marked x).
- Remaining possible letters include D, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z, etc.

B can occupy position 1 or 4. A common English word fitting the pattern with B at position 1 and using only allowed letters is **BADGE** (B A D G E). This respects all known constraints and introduces new letters D and G for further narrowing.

Thus the next guess should be BADGE.
