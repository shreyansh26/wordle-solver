### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback on ""CRANE"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that contains R and A in different positions (R ≠ 2, A ≠ 3) and avoids C, N, E. A good candidate is **RAILS**:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- The other letters I, L, S have not been ruled out yet.
Thus “RAILS” satisfies all constraints from the previous feedback.

We have:
- Secret word length 5.
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, N, E are not in the word; R and A are in the word but not in the positions they occupied (R not position 2, A not position 3).
- From guess 2 (RAILS): R is correct in position 1; A is in the word but not position 2; I, L, S are not in the word.

Thus:
- Position 1 = **R**.
- A is somewhere in positions 3‑5 (cannot be 2).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, I, L, S.
- Remaining letters to discover must come from the rest of the alphabet.

We need a new guess that keeps R at position 1, places A at a later position (3‑5), and introduces unexplored letters while avoiding the excluded ones.  
A good candidate is **RUMBA**:
- R remains at position 1 (confirmed).
- A is placed at position 5 (allowed).
- New letters U, M, B are all still possible and have not been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters are present.

This guess will tell us whether any of U, M, B belong in the secret word and confirm the location of A.
