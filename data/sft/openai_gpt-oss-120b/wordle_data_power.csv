### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have two rounds of feedback:

1. **crane** → C (x), R (-), A (x), N (x), E (-)  
   - Letters **C, A, N** are not in the word.  
   - **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 5.

2. **rebut** → R (-), E (-), B (x), U (x), T (x)  
   - **B, U, T** are not in the word.  
   - **R** is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 2.

So far the only confirmed letters are **R** and **E**.  
Excluded letters: C, A, N, B, U, T.  

Position constraints:
- **R** cannot be at positions 1 or 2 → possible positions: 3, 4, 5.  
- **E** cannot be at positions 2 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

We need a 5‑letter word containing R and E (in allowed spots) and three other letters that are not among the excluded set.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is **SKIER**:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the new guess must contain R and E in different positions (R ≠ 2, E ≠ 5) and must avoid C, A, N. A good candidate is **REBUT** (R at position 1, E at position 2, and no forbidden letters).

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two rounds of feedback:

1. **crane** → C (x), R (-), A (x), N (x), E (-)  
   - Letters **C, A, N** are not in the word.  
   - **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 5.

2. **rebut** → R (-), E (-), B (x), U (x), T (x)  
   - **B, U, T** are not in the word.  
   - **R** is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 2.

So far the only confirmed letters are **R** and **E**.  
Excluded letters: C, A, N, B, U, T.  

Position constraints:
- **R** cannot be at positions 1 or 2 → possible positions: 3, 4, 5.  
- **E** cannot be at positions 2 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

We need a 5‑letter word containing R and E (in allowed spots) and three other letters that are not among the excluded set.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is **SKIER**:
- S (1) – allowed  
- K (2) – allowed  
- I (3) – allowed  
- **E** (4) – E is allowed at position 4  
- **R** (5) – R is allowed at position 5  

No prohibited letters appear, and the placement of R and E respects the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
