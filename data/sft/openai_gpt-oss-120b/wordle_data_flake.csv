### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter English word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter in word‑guessing games because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good chance of hitting some letters of the secret word.

From the first guess I know:
- Position 3 is A (✓)
- Position 5 is E (✓)
- Letters C, R, N are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word fits the pattern __A_E and must avoid C, R, N. I’ll choose a word that introduces new letters while respecting this pattern. “FLAME” fits (__A_E), uses new letters F, L, M and doesn’t contain any prohibited letters.

The feedback tells us:
- Positions 1,2,3,5 are correct: F L A _ E
- Letter M is not in the word, nor are C, R, N from the first guess.
We need a common word matching FLA_E with a new fourth letter not among {M, C, R, N}. “FLAKE” fits this pattern and introduces K, which hasn't been ruled out.
