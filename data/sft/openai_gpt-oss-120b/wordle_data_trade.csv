### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Pattern is _ R A _ E (R at position 2, A at position 3, E at position 5).
- Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, N, B, V, G, P, I.
- Letter T received a “-” at position 4, meaning T is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 2, 3, and 5 are already occupied, T must be in position 1.
- Therefore the word pattern is T R A _ E.
- The fourth letter cannot be T (already used), nor any excluded letters (C, N, B, V, G, P, I). Common possibilities include D, L, M, O, S, Y, H, etc.
- “TRADE” (T R A D E) fits the pattern, uses a new, plausible fourth letter, and is a common English word.

Thus the next logical guess is TRADE.
