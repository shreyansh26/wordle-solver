### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with C that also contains R, A, and E, placing them in positions different from those ruled out.  
The word **CAPER** satisfies all conditions:
- C ✓ (position 1)
- A moves to position 2 (allowed, not position 3)
- P is a new filler letter
- E moves to position 4 (allowed, not position 5)
- R moves to position 5 (allowed, not position 2)

Thus “caper” is a valid next guess.

We have fixed letters:
- Position 1 = C (confirmed)
- Position 5 = R (confirmed)

From feedback:
- A is not in positions 2 or 3, and also not position 3 from first guess, so the only remaining slot is position 4 → A must be at position 4.
- E is not in positions 4 or 5, so it must be at position 2 or 3.

Thus the pattern is: C _ _ A R, with E occupying either the 2nd or 3rd spot.  
A common English word that fits this pattern and includes E is **CEDAR** (C E D A R). It respects all known constraints and uses a new letter D that hasn't been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “cedar”.
