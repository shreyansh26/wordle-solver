### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word‑guessing game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and both a vowel (A) and a frequently used ending (E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct at position 2.
- A is correct at position 3.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word looks like: _ R A _ _.  
Since N is not at position 4 and cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (occupied by R and A), the only remaining spots for N are position 1 or 5. Position 1 cannot be C (already ruled out), so the most likely placement is N at position 5, giving the pattern _ R A _ N.

We need a common five‑letter word fitting that pattern and introducing new letters. “BRAIN” (B R A I N) matches perfectly: it keeps R and A in the known spots, puts N at the end, and adds B and I to test.

So the next guess will be BRAIN.
