### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter starter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good choice because it covers the vowels A and E and common consonants C, R, N. I’ll use that as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

I need a new 5‑letter word that does not contain C, A, N, E, and includes R in a different spot. Choosing “ROUST” gives R in position 1 and adds new letters O, U, S, T, which we haven’t tested yet.

We know the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, and T, each in a different position than they appeared in the previous guesses. The forbidden positions are:
- R cannot be 1 or 2.
- O cannot be 2.
- S cannot be 4.
- T cannot be 5.
All other letters seen (C, A, N, E, U) are not in the word.

A common English word that satisfies these constraints and includes a fifth letter not yet excluded is **STORM**:
- S (position 1) – allowed.
- T (position 2) – allowed.
- O (position 3) – allowed.
- R (position 4) – allowed.
- M (position 5) – a new letter, not excluded.

Thus ""STORM"" is a valid next guess.
