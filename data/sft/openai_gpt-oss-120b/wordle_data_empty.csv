### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word contains **E** and **T**, both somewhere in positions 1‑4 (E cannot be 2 or 5; T cannot be 5). All other guessed letters (C,R,A,N,H,I,S) are excluded.

We need three more letters that are not among the excluded set. Choosing common, allowed letters gives the word **MUTED**:
- Letters: M, U, T, E, D – all allowed.
- T is in position 3 (not 5), E is in position 4 (not 2 or 5), satisfying the placement clues.

So the next guess is “MUTED”.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is present but not in position 5.
- From HEIST: H, I, S are not in the word; E is also not in position 2; T is present but not in position 5.
- From MUTED: M is present but not in position 1; U and D are not in the word; T is present but not in position 3; E is present but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **E**, **T**, and **M**.

Position restrictions:
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5 → possible positions 1 or 3.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2, 4.
- M cannot be in position 1 → possible positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **EMPTY**:
- E is in position 1 (allowed),
- M is in position 2 (allowed, not position 1),
- T is in position 4 (allowed, not positions 3 or 5),
- P and Y are new letters not previously ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be “EMPTY”.
