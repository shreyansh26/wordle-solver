2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = R (from CRANE)
- Position 3 = O (from PROUD, ✓)
- Position 5 = D (from PROUD, ✓)

Letters known NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, P, U, plus also we know P is not in the word (from PROUD). 

So the secret word fits the pattern _ R O _ D.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word using those fixed letters and avoiding the excluded ones.  
“BROOD” matches: B R O O D → fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and is a common word.  

Thus the next guess should be BROOD.
