I need to start the game with a first guess. I’ll pick a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter word.

We know the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position (as indicated by '-'). The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all. To get more info, we should guess a word that includes A in a different position and uses new letters, while avoiding the forbidden letters. “BALMY” places A in the 2nd spot and introduces B, L, M, Y, none of which have been ruled out yet.

From the feedback:
- B is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 → must be position 4.
- Y is correct in position 5.
Thus the pattern is B A _ L Y. The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""BADLY"".
