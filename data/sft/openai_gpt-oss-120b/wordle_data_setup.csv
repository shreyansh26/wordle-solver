### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:

We know from the feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T are NOT in the secret word.
- The letter E is correct in position 2 (E is green at the second slot).

Therefore the secret word has the form _ E _ _ _, and cannot contain any of the eliminated letters listed above. To get more information, I’ll choose a word that keeps E in the second spot and introduces several new letters that haven’t been tested yet. “FELIX” fits:
- Keeps E in position 2.
- Adds new letters F, L, I, X, none of which have been ruled out.
- Is a valid English 5‑letter word.

Thus the next guess is “FELIX”.

Current knowledge:
- E is confirmed at position 2 (✓).
- U is confirmed at position 4 (✓).
- Letters P and T are present in the word but in wrong positions: P is not at position 3; T is not at position 5.
- All other letters tried (C,R,A,N,D,O,F,L,I,X,B,G,M) are absent.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ E _ U _ containing P and T (in allowed spots) and using only letters not eliminated.

A word that satisfies all constraints is **SETUP**:
- Pattern S E T U P matches _E_U_.
- T is at position 3 (allowed, since T only cannot be position 5).
- P is at position 5 (allowed, since P only cannot be position 3).
- All letters (S, E, T, U, P) are either confirmed present or not previously eliminated.

Thus ""SETUP"" fits the feedback perfectly and is a common English word.
