# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes C and E in different positions while respecting those constraints. “PECKS” places E in position 2 and C in position 3, both allowed, and introduces new letters (P, K, S) that we haven’t tested yet.

We have determined the secret word must contain the letters C and E, and none of the letters R, A, N, P, K, S.  

Feedback constraints:
- C is NOT in positions 1 or 3, so C can be in 2, 4, or 5.
- E is NOT in positions 2 or 5, so E can be in 1, 3, or 4.

A word that fits these placements is **OCTET**:
- C is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- The other letters O, T, T have not been ruled out yet.

Thus OCTET is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:
- The secret word contains **C** and **E**.
- **C** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → C must be in position 4 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 3.
All other letters tried (R, A, N, P, K, S, O, T) are not in the word.

A useful next guess should keep C and E in allowed spots and introduce new letters to test their positions.  
The word **ELECT** places:
- E at positions 1 and 3 (both allowed for E)
- C at position 4 (allowed for C)
- Adds new letters L and also repeats an excluded letter T (which will simply be marked as absent).

Thus **ELECT** satisfies all known constraints and will give us more information about the exact locations of C and E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters C and E, but:
- C is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.
Letters R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes C and E in different positions while respecting those constraints. “PECKS” places E in position 2 and C in position 3, both allowed, and introduces new letters (P, K, S) that we haven’t tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PECKS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) C(-) K(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the secret word must contain the letters C and E, and none of the letters R, A, N, P, K, S.  

Feedback constraints:
- C is NOT in positions 1 or 3, so C can be in 2, 4, or 5.
- E is NOT in positions 2 or 5, so E can be in 1, 3, or 4.

A word that fits these placements is **OCTET**:
- C is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- The other letters O, T, T have not been ruled out yet.

Thus OCTET is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PECKS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) C(-) K(x) S(x)
Guess 3: OCTET -> FEEDBACK: O(x) C(-) T(-) E(-) T(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback so far:
- The secret word contains **C** and **E**.
- **C** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → C must be in position 4 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 3.
All other letters tried (R, A, N, P, K, S, O, T) are not in the word.

A useful next guess should keep C and E in allowed spots and introduce new letters to test their positions.  
The word **ELECT** places:
- E at positions 1 and 3 (both allowed for E)
- C at position 4 (allowed for C)
- Adds new letters L and also repeats an excluded letter T (which will simply be marked as absent).

Thus **ELECT** satisfies all known constraints and will give us more information about the exact locations of C and E.

We have determined:
- E is confirmed at position 1 (E✓).
- C is confirmed in the word but cannot be in positions 1‑4, leaving position 5.
- Letters ruled out: R, A, N, P, K, S, O, L, and (likely) T from the last feedback, though earlier feedback suggested T might be present. To stay safe we avoid the definitely excluded letters.
- The pattern is therefore **E _ _ _ C**.

A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet eliminated is **ETHIC** (E T H I C). This will test the remaining possible letters while respecting all known constraints.
