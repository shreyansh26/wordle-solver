### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:
- From guess 1: C,R,A,N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2: Position 3 is E (✓). The second E in the guess (position 4) got “-”, so the word contains another E, but not at position 4. H is in the word but not at position 2 (‑). Letters S,P are not in the word.

Thus the secret word has at least two E’s: one fixed at position 3, another at position 1 or 2 (cannot be 4 or 5). H is somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.

We need a new guess that respects known constraints and tests new letters.  
Choosing **DEEDY** gives:
- Pattern D E E D Y → position 3 is E (matches known ✓).
- The second E is at position 2, allowing us to check if the other E belongs at 2 (would give ✓) or elsewhere (‑).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (D, Y are new; no C,R,A,N,S,P).
- No H, but that’s fine; we can locate the extra E first and later place H.

So we guess DEEDY.
