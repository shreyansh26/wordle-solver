### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it got a “-” in the fifth slot of CRANE). Our next guess should therefore:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include an E, placed somewhere other than the fifth position.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **BLEED**:
- It contains two E’s (both not in position 5).
- It uses new letters B, L, D, which we haven’t tested yet.
- It obeys all the constraints from the previous feedback.

Thus the next guess will be BLEED.

""CRANE"" is a frequently used starter in word‑guessing games because it contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it got a “-” in the fifth slot of CRANE). Our next guess should therefore:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include an E, placed somewhere other than the fifth position.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **BLEED**:
- It contains two E’s (both not in position 5).
- It uses new letters B, L, D, which we haven’t tested yet.
- It obeys all the constraints from the previous feedback.

Thus the next guess will be BLEED.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BLEED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) E(✓) E(-) D(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (BLEED): B,L,D are not in the word; the first E (position 3) is correct (✓); the second E (position 4) is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Thus:
- Position 3 is definitely **E**.
- There is at least one more **E** somewhere else, but not in positions 4 or 5 (and not position 3 again). So the second E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, B, L, D, plus any other letters already marked x.
- Allowed letters: any not yet ruled out.

We need a 5‑letter word with E at position 3 and another E at position 1 or 2, using only allowed letters. A good candidate is **SEEKS** (S E E K S):
- Position 1 = S (allowed)
- Position 2 = E (second required E, not in 4 or 5)
- Position 3 = E (confirmed)
- Position 4 = K (allowed)
- Position 5 = S (allowed)

All letters are permissible, and the pattern fits the constraints.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have:

Letters ruled out completely: C, R, A, N, B, L, D, K (all got “x”).  
Letter E is present (✓ at position 3) and not at positions 2, 4, 5.

We need a word of the form **S ? E ? ?**, using only letters not ruled out, and we can include a repeated E to test whether there is more than one E. A good candidate is **SHEEP** (S H E E P): it respects the known positions, introduces new letters H and P, and checks if a second E exists.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 1 is S (✓ from multiple guesses).
- Position 3 is E (✓ from BLEED and SHEEP).
- The word contains at least one more E, and the only remaining slot that hasn't been ruled out for a second E is position 5 (positions 2 and 4 gave “-” for E, and position 5 hasn't been tried with E yet).

Thus the pattern is **S _ E _ E**.

We need a common English word matching that pattern using only letters not excluded (C, R, A, N, B, L, D, K, H, P are all out).  
**SIEVE** fits perfectly:
- S at position 1 (already confirmed).
- I at position 2 – a new, allowed letter.
- E at position 3 (confirmed).
- V at position 4 – new and allowed.
- E at position 5 – supplies the second required E.

Therefore, the next guess should be “SIEVE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)

All letters that received an “x” are not in the word: A, B, C, D, H, I, K, L, N, P, R, V.

The remaining possible letters are: F, G, J, M, O, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and S, E already used).

Thus the word must fit the pattern **S _ E _ _** using only the allowed letters.  
A common word that satisfies all constraints is **STEWY** (S‑T‑E‑W‑Y), where T, W, Y have not been eliminated.

So the next guess is:
