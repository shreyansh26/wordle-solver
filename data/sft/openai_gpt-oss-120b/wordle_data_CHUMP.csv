### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have these constraints:

- Letters R, A, N, E, L, O, T, B, I are not in the word.
- U is in the word but not in positions 2, 4 (from the “-” feedback on guesses 2 and 3). So U can be in position 3 or 5.
- No other letters are ruled out, and the second C in guess 3 only tells us C appears elsewhere (it does at position 1), so we don’t need a second C.

We need a common 5‑letter word starting with C, containing U at position 3 or 5, and using only allowed letters.  
The word **CHUMP** fits:
- C H U M P
- C is correct at position 1.
- U is at position 3 (allowed).
- H, M, P are not among the excluded letters.

Thus CHUMP is a valid next guess.
