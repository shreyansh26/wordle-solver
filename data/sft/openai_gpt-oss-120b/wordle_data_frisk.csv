### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good starter word includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information quickly. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening choice because it contains the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know from the first guess:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is correct and in the second position.

Thus the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _. We should pick a new word that keeps R in the second spot and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good choice is “PROUD” (P‑R‑O‑U‑D), which tests several new common letters while respecting the known position of R.

We know from previous feedback:
- R is correct in the second position.
- Letters C, A, N, E, P, O, U, D are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R _ _ _. We need a new guess with R as the second letter and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. Choosing “FRISK” (F‑R‑I‑S‑K) fits the pattern and introduces several new letters (F, I, S, K) that are still possible.
