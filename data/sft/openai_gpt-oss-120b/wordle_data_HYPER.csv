### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the next guess must include R and E in different positions, avoid C, A, N, and place R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

A good candidate word is **BERTH**:
- Contains R (position 4) and E (position 1), satisfying the placement constraints.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (B, T, H).
- Is a valid common 5‑letter English word.

Thus I will submit “BERTH” as the next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- Letters C, A, N, B, T are not in the word.
- Letters R, E, H are in the word but not in the positions they appeared:
  * R is not in positions 2 or 3.
  * E is not in positions 2 or 5.
  * H is not in position 5.
- We need a five‑letter word containing R, E, H (each once) and two other letters that are not excluded.

Considering the constraints, the word **RHEUM** (R‑H‑E‑U‑M) fits:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- H is in position 2 (allowed, not 5).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, not 2 or 5).
- U and M are new letters not ruled out.
Thus it satisfies all known information.

- Letters not in the word (x): C, A, N, B, T, U, M.
- Letters in the word but wrong positions (-):
  * R is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 → R can be position 4 or 5.
  * E is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 → E can be position 1 or 4.
  * H is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 5 → H can be position 1, 3, or 4.
- Position 2 cannot be R, E, or H, so it must be a different letter.

We need a 5‑letter word containing R, E, H plus two other letters (not any of the eliminated ones).  
Trying to satisfy the positional constraints, the word **HOVER** works:

- H at position 1 (allowed).
- O at position 2 (new letter, allowed).
- V at position 3 (new letter, allowed).
- E at position 4 (E allowed here).

We have confirmed letters:

- R is correct at position 5 (✓).

So the secret word matches the pattern **H _ _ E R**.

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (marked x) are: C, A, N, B, T, U, M, O, V.

We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not any of those excluded letters and also not H, E, R (already placed). Viable candidates include I, K, L, P, S, Y, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern H _ _ E R is **HIKER** (H I K E R), using I and K which have not been excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

So the next guess must include R and E in different positions, avoid C, A, N, and place R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

A good candidate word is **BERTH**:
- Contains R (position 4) and E (position 1), satisfying the placement constraints.
