### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters C, N, E, T, P, S.  
We know the secret word contains **A** and **R**, but neither can be in positions 2 or 3.  
Thus A and R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

A good next guess should place A and R in allowed slots while introducing new letters to test.  
Choosing a word with A in position 1 and R in position 5 satisfies the constraints and adds fresh letters M, O, U for more information.

The word **AMOUR** fits:  
- A (pos 1) – allowed  
- R (pos 5) – allowed  
- No forbidden letters (C,N,E,T,P,S) are present.

2. R at 1, A at 5
3. R at 4, A at 5

We need a guess that respects one of these patterns and introduces three new letters to test. The word **LIBRA** fits pattern R at 4, A at 5 (L I B R A). L, I, B have not been tried and are not among excluded letters. This will give us new information about three fresh letters while keeping A and R in allowed spots.

We have determined the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Position 1: R (must be here)
- Position 2: I (confirmed)
- Position 4: A (must be here)
- Position 3 and 5 are unknown, but one of them must be L (since L is in the word but not in position 1).
- All other letters tried (C, N, E, T, P, S, M, O, U, B) are not in the word.

A common English word that satisfies these constraints is **RIVAL** (R I V A L): it places R, I, A correctly, puts L in position 5, and introduces a new letter V in position 3.

Thus the next guess should be RIVAL.
