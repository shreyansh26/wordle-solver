### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I'll pick a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 2 is A (✓ from SAINT).
- Position 4 is N (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, E, S, I, T are not in the word (all marked x).
So the word looks like _ A _ N _.  
We need a common English word using only the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) besides the known A and N.

A suitable candidate fitting the pattern is **FANNY**:
- F (allowed)
- A (✓ in position 2)
- N (position 3, also allowed)
- N (position 4, matches the known N)
- Y (allowed)

This word respects all constraints and introduces new letters F and Y for further clues.
