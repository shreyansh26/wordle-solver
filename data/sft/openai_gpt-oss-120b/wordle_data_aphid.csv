### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next guess must contain A in a different position (1,2,4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 1 is A (confirmed).
- Position 4 is I (confirmed).
- Position 5 is D (confirmed).
- Letter P is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4; the only remaining slot is position 2, so P must be at position 2.
Thus the word pattern is A P _ I D.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern, using only letters not ruled out by previous “x” feedback. The letters eliminated are C, R, N, E, L, B, U, M, O, T, S, and others from earlier guesses. The letter H has not been eliminated and forms the common word **APHID** (a type of insect).

Therefore the next guess should be ""APHID"".
