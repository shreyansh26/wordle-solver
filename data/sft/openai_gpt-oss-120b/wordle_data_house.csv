### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 5 = E (from CRANE and SLIDE).
- Letters C, R, A, N, L, I, D are not in the word.
- Letter S is in the word but not in position 1 (from SLIDE's first slot marked ""-"").

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing S somewhere other than the first position, and avoiding the forbidden letters. “MOUSE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- Contains S in position 4 (not first).
- Uses only letters M, O, U, S, E, none of which have been excluded.

Thus “MOUSE” is a good next guess.

- Position 5 is definitely **E** (from all guesses).
- Position 2 is **O**, Position 3 is **U**, Position 4 is **S** (from guess MOUSE where those were marked ✓).
- Position 1 is still unknown. Letters that are ruled out for the whole word are C, R, A, N, L, I, D, M. The letter S cannot be in position 1 (from earlier feedback). 
- The only viable pattern is **?OUSE**. The common English word that fits is **HOUSE**, with H not among the excluded letters.

Thus the next logical guess is ""HOUSE"".
