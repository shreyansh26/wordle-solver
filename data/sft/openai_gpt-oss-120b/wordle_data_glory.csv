### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. “CRANE” is a widely used starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know:
- Letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a new guess that includes R in a different position and introduces new letters to test. Choose a word without the excluded letters and place R somewhere else, e.g., position 3.

Word ""WORLD"" fits: W O R L D (no C, A, N, E) and puts R at position 3.

We have eliminated letters C, A, N, E, W, D. The letters O, R, and L are known to be in the secret word but placed incorrectly in previous guesses: O is not in position 2, R is not in positions 2 or 3, and L is not in position 4.  
We need a new word that includes O, R, L in different positions while avoiding the excluded letters. “GLORY” (G‑L‑O‑R‑Y) satisfies all constraints: L is at position 2 (allowed), O at position 3 (allowed), R at position 4 (allowed), and the other letters G and Y are new tests.  
Thus the next guess is:
