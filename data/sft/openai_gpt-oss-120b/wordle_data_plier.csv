### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, A, N are not in the word (x).
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared: R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains R and E, places them elsewhere, and avoids C, A, N. “ROVER” fits:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from the feedback:

- Letters **C, A, N, O, V** are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letter **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (first R got ‘-’).  
  We also know **R** is correct at position 5 (✓).
- Letter **E** is correct at position 4 (✓).

Thus the secret word looks like: _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters unknown and none of them can be C, A, N, O, V, and position 1 cannot be R.

We need a new guess that respects the known placements and introduces new letters to test. A good candidate is **TIMER** (T I M E R), which fits the pattern ___ER, avoids all eliminated letters, and adds three fresh letters (T, I, M) for more information.

So the next guess will be “TIMER”.

So the secret pattern is ___ER, with I somewhere other than position 2. That leaves I at position 1 or 3.  
A good word that fits the pattern, keeps I at position 1, and introduces two new letters (D and L) is **IDLER**.

This guess will confirm whether the word starts with I and test D and L while respecting all known constraints.

Current confirmed letters:
- Position 4 = E (green)
- Position 5 = R (green)
- I is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 ⇒ must be position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 ⇒ can be position 1 or 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ I E R, with L occupying either the first or second slot.

Possible words fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out include **FLIER**, **SLIER**, **PLIER**, etc.  
Choosing **PLIER** tests a new first‑letter (P) while keeping L in position 2, which is consistent with the known clues.

Therefore the next guess is:
