### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

The feedback tells me that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all, while E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since it was marked “-”).  
I need a new five‑letter guess that:
- Does **not** contain C, R, A, or N.
- Includes the letter E, but not in the fifth slot.

A good candidate is **DEMIT**:
- It contains E in the second position (not fifth).

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 2 (DEMIT): D, M, T are not in the word (x). E is again marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. I is marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letters **E** and **I**.
- Not contain any of C, R, A, N, D, M, T.
- Place **E** somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Place **I** somewhere other than position 4.

A valid English word meeting all those constraints is **PIXEL**:

- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since only position 4 is forbidden for I).
