### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which will give useful information about the secret word.

Given the feedback, the secret word has A in the third position, and does not contain C, R, N, or E anywhere. I need a new 5‑letter word with A at position 3 and avoiding those letters. “BLAST” fits: B L A S T, with A correctly placed and no C, R, N, or E.

We know:
- A is correct at position 3.
- S is correct at position 4.
- T is in the word but not at position 5 (so it must be position 1 or 2).
- Letters C, R, N, E, B, L are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word matching the pattern _ _ A S _.  
If T is in position 2, a valid word is **STASH** (S T A S H):
- Position 2 gives T (allowed).
- Position 3 A and position 4 S match the confirmed letters.
- No forbidden letters appear, and T is not at position 5.

Thus STASH is a logical next guess.
