### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C and R are not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- A and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (A not at 3, E not at 5).

For the next guess we must keep N at the fourth position and avoid C and R.  
A and E can be placed elsewhere later, but this guess will test new letters while preserving the known N position.

I’ll choose a word that:
- Has N in the fourth slot.
- Contains no C or R.
- Does not place E at the fifth slot.

We have the following feedback:

- N is correct at position 4 (✓ from all guesses).
- E is correct at position 3 (✓ from AGENT).
- A is in the word but not at position 1 (AGENT gave A‑) and also not at position 3 (CRANE gave A‑). Therefore A can be at position 2 or 5.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, P, L, U, K, G, T.
- Remaining possible letters include H, Y, etc.

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern: _ _ E N _.  
It must contain A at position 2 or 5, and the remaining two letters must not be any eliminated letters.

Looking for a common English word that satisfies these constraints, **HYENA** fits perfectly:
- H Y E N A → positions: H(1), Y(2), E(3), N(4), A(5)
- E is at position 3, N at position 4 as required.
- A is at position 5, which is allowed (not at 1 or 3).
- Letters H and Y have not been ruled out.
