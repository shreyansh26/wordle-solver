I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and different positions, to gather useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E, covering a broad set of common letters.

We know:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letters C and A are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.

We need a new guess that keeps E at the end, includes R and N in allowed positions, and introduces new letters to test further. The word **RINSE** fits:
- R at position 1 (allowed)
- I at position 2 (new)
- N at position 3 (allowed)
- S at position 4 (new)
- E at position 5 (confirmed)

Thus, RINSE is a logical second guess.
