### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but cannot be in the third position (the position it occupied in ""CRANE"").

Our next guess should:
- Include the letter A (but not in position 3).
- Avoid the letters C, R, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **FATAL**:
- Contains A in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).
- Uses only letters F, T, L besides A, none of which have been ruled out yet.
- Provides a chance to test A's placement and reveal new letters.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, N, E, F, T are not in the word.
- A is in the word, not in position 3 (from “CRANE”) and is correct in position 2 (from “FATAL”). The second A in “FATAL” got a “-”, meaning another A exists elsewhere but not at position 4, so the extra A must be at position 1 or 5.
- L is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the pattern must contain:
- A at position 2,
- Another A at position 1 or 5,
- L somewhere in positions 1‑4 (but not 5),
- No letters C,R,N,E,F,T.

A word that fits is **SALVA** (S A L V A): A at 2 and 5, L at 3 (not 5), and uses only allowed letters. This will test the remaining unknown letters S and V while satisfying all constraints.

Guess 2: FATAL -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) T(x) A(-) L(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, N, E, F, T are not in the word.
- A is in the word, not in position 3 (from “CRANE”) and is correct in position 2 (from “FATAL”). The second A in “FATAL” got a “-”, meaning another A exists elsewhere but not at position 4, so the extra A must be at position 1 or 5.
- L is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the pattern must contain:
- A at position 2,
- Another A at position 1 or 5,
- L somewhere in positions 1‑4 (but not 5),
- No letters C,R,N,E,F,T.

A word that fits is **SALVA** (S A L V A): A at 2 and 5, L at 3 (not 5), and uses only allowed letters. This will test the remaining unknown letters S and V while satisfying all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FATAL -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) T(x) A(-) L(-)
Guess 3: SALVA -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(-) V(x) A(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have deduced the following constraints from the feedback:
- The secret word contains the letter **A** in position 2 (✓).
- A second **A** is present, but it cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5, so it must be in position 1.
- The letter **L** is present, but not in positions 3 or 5; the only remaining slot is position 4.
- Letters **C, R, N, E, F, T, S, V** are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is **A A _ L _**.  
We need to test possible letters for positions 3 and 5. A plausible word that fits the known letters is **AARLY**, which will also check whether **R** (currently thought to be excluded) might actually be present.

I'll guess ""AARLY"".
