### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 of “CRANE”). For the next guess we should avoid the excluded letters and place E in a different slot to test its exact position. A good candidate is “HEIST”: it contains E at position 2, and uses new letters H, I, S, T that haven’t been ruled out.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- The word contains **E** and **S**, but:
  * E is not in position 2 (from guess HEIST) and not in position 5 (from guess CRANE). So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  * S is not in position 4 (from guess HEIST). So S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that uses only allowed letters (the alphabet minus the excluded ones) and places E and S in positions that satisfy the above constraints.

The word **SKEWS** meets all conditions:
- Uses only allowed letters: S, K, E, W, S (K and W are not excluded).
- Contains E at position 3 (allowed) and S at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed, and S is not at position 4).

  * S is not in position 4 (from guess HEIST). So S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that uses only allowed letters (the alphabet minus the excluded ones) and places E and S in positions that satisfy the above constraints.

The word **SKEWS** meets all conditions:
- Uses only allowed letters: S, K, E, W, S (K and W are not excluded).
- Contains E at position 3 (allowed) and S at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed, and S is not at position 4).

Thus “SKEWS” is a suitable next guess.

- Excluded letters (gray): C, R, A, N, H, I, T, K, W.
All other letters are still possible.

We need a word of the form S _ E _ _. A good candidate that uses only allowed letters and respects the position constraints is **SPEED**:
- Position 1 = S (matches green).
- Position 2 = P (still unknown, allowed).
- Position 3 = E (matches green).
- Position 4 = E (E is allowed here; we only know it’s not in positions 2 or 5).
- Position 5 = D (still unknown, allowed and not excluded).

Thus “SPEED” satisfies all current constraints and introduces new letters P and D for testing.

We have the following constraints from the feedback so far:

- Position 1 is **S** (green).
- Position 3 is **E** (green).
- Position 4 is **E** (green).
- Letter **P** is in the word but not in position 2 (yellow from “SPEED”), so it must be in position 5.
- Letter **E** is not in position 5 (from the first guess), which is already satisfied.
- No letters C, R, A, N, H, I, T, K, W, D are in the word.

Thus the pattern is: **S _ E E P**.  
The only common English word fitting this pattern is **SLEEP** (the unknown second letter is L). This also introduces a new letter L to test.

So the next guess should be:
