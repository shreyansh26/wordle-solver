### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain R and E, with R not at position 2 and E not at position 5. It must not contain C, A, or N.

I need a new five‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and introduces new letters to gather more information. “relit” (R‑E‑L‑I‑T) satisfies these constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: relit -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E, I.
- R is not in positions 1 (from guess 2) or 2 (from guess 1). So R can be 3,4,5.
- E is not in positions 2 (from guess 1) or 5 (from guess 1). So E can be 1,3,4.
- I is not in position 4 (from guess 2). So I can be 1,2,3,5.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, T.
- Need two more letters that are not excluded.

The word **HIDER** contains the required letters R, E, I and adds H and D (both allowed). Its positions are:
1 H, 2 I, 3 D, 4 E, 5 R.

All positions satisfy the constraints:
- R at position 5 (allowed),
- E at position 4 (allowed),
- I at position 2 (allowed),
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus ""HIDER"" is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (crane): C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are present but in wrong spots.
- From guess 2 (relit): L and T are not in the word; R, E, I are present but in wrong spots.
- From guess 3 (hider): H and D are not in the word; I is correct at position 2; E and R are present but in wrong spots.

So the secret word must contain **I, R, E**.  
I is fixed at position 2.  
R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 → R can be 3 or 4.  
E cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5 → E can be 1 or 3.

We need two more letters that are not among the excluded set {C, A, N, L, T, H, D}.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **BIERS**:
- B I E R S
- I is at position 2 (✓).
- E is at position 3 (allowed).
- R is at position 4 (allowed).
- B and S are new letters not excluded.

Thus “biers” is a valid next guess.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 2 is I (I ✓).
- Position 3 is E (E ✓).
- Position 4 is R (R ✓).
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: C, A, N, L, T, H, D, B, S, plus any other letters marked “x”.
- The remaining unknown letters are at positions 1 and 5, and they must be letters that have not been ruled out.

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ I E R _** and uses only allowable letters is **FIERY** (F I E R Y).  
- F is not among the excluded letters.  
- Y is also not excluded.  

Thus “fiery” satisfies all constraints and is a good next guess.
