### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- R is correct at position 1.
- There is at least one more R somewhere else (second R got “-”).
- E is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses), so E can be at position 2 or 3.
- Letters C, A, N, I, D are not in the word.

We need a new word that keeps R in position 1, places E in a possible spot (2 or 3), includes another R to test the duplicate, and introduces fresh letters.

“RETRO” fits:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- Contains a second R in position 4 (tests the duplicate)
- Introduces T and O (new letters)
- Uses no excluded letters.

Thus “RETRO” is a strong next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed:
- R is correct at position 1.
- There is at least one more R somewhere else (second R got “-”).
- E is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses), so E can be at position 2 or 3.
- Letters C, A, N, I, D are not in the word.

We need a new word that keeps R in position 1, places E in a possible spot (2 or 3), includes another R to test the duplicate, and introduces fresh letters.

“RETRO” fits:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- Contains a second R in position 4 (tests the duplicate)
- Introduces T and O (new letters)
- Uses no excluded letters.

Thus “RETRO” is a strong next guess.

We have confirmed:

- Position 2 is **E** (green from Retro).
- Letters **C, A, N, I, D, T, O, B** are not in the word (all got x).
- **L** is in the word but not at position 5 (L at position 5 got “-” in Rebel), so L must be at position 3 or 4.
- The second R received “-” in Rider (pos5) and Retro (pos4), indicating any additional R is not at those spots; it could be at position 3, but we can also consider that there is only one R (the duplicate “-” just signals the letter exists elsewhere, i.e., position 1).

Given the confirmed letters **R** and **E** at the start, a plausible pattern is **R E _ L _** (L at position 4) or **R E L _ _** (L at position 3).  

A common English word that fits the known pattern, respects all exclusions, and places L at position 4 is **REELS** (R E E L S). This word also introduces a new letter **S** and repeats **E** to check any duplicate‑E behavior.

Thus the next guess should be “REELS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good candidate is **RIDER**:

We have confirmed the first two letters: R in position 1 and E in position 2.  
From guess 5 (REELS) we learned that L is correct in position 4, while the third E is only a duplicate (marked “-”), meaning the word contains only the one E already placed at position 2.  

Letters that have received an “x” and are therefore not in the secret word: C, A, N, I, D, T, O, B, S.  

Thus the pattern is:

1 R 2 E 3 ? 4 L 5 ?

We need a common English word fitting **R E _ L _** that uses none of the excluded letters.  
“REPLY” (R‑E‑P‑L‑Y) satisfies the pattern, introduces two new letters P and Y (which have not been ruled out), and avoids all eliminated letters.

Therefore the next guess should be **REPLY**.
