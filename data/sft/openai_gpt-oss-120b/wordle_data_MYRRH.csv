### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback on the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Does not contain C, A, N, or E.
2. Contains R, and R must appear in a position other than the second slot.

A good candidate is **STORM**:
- It uses only letters S, T, O, R, M, none of which are ruled out.
- R appears in position 4, satisfying the “wrong position” requirement.

Thus we’ll guess STORM.

A good next guess should keep R at position 4, include M in one of the first three slots, and can safely include other letters even if they turn out to be wrong (they’ll just be marked x).  
The word **SMIRK** satisfies these conditions:
- R is at position 4 (matching the known correct spot).
- M is at position 2, testing whether M belongs there.
- The other letters (S, I, K) are allowed to be tried; S we already know is not in the word, but using it now will simply give an x and not affect the information about M.

- Remaining positions (1,2,3,5) must be filled with letters that have not been ruled out.
