### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess I want a word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to give me the most information possible about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the common vowel A and E. This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first guess that:
- The letter A is correct and in the 3rd position.
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like __A__ with none of the eliminated letters. I’ll choose a word that keeps A in the 3rd spot and introduces new letters to test more possibilities. “PLAIT” fits: P L A I T, with all other letters unused so far.

We need a common English word fitting the pattern __A__ using only these allowed letters.  
The word **FOAMS** (F O A M S) satisfies:  
- A is in the third position.  
- Contains only allowed letters (F, O, M, S).  
- Is a valid 5‑letter English word.
