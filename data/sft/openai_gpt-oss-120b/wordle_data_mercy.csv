### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (positions 1,2,5 respectively).
- A and N are not in the word at all.

So:
- C cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new word that includes C, R, and E in other positions, and introduces new letters to test further. The word **MERCH** fits these constraints:
- Contains C, R, and E.
- Places them in positions 4 (C), 3 (R), and 2 (E), none of which were their original positions.
- Adds new letters M and H, giving us more information.

Thus MERCH is a logical second guess.

From the second guess MERCH we learned:
- M, E, R, C are all correct and in the right positions.
- H is not in the word.

Thus the secret word is M E R C _ .
The only unknown is the fifth letter. It cannot be A, N, H (already ruled out). A common English word that fits the pattern is **MERCY**. The fifth letter Y hasn't been tried yet, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.
