### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since there is no prior information, I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters. ""ARISE"" includes A, R, I, S, and E, which are common and will give useful feedback.

We have feedback from first guess ARISE:
- A is not in the word.
- R is correct and in position 2.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S and E are not in the word.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains R at the second letter.
- Contains I, but not at the third position.
- Does not contain A, S, E.

We need a five‑letter word with R in the second slot, includes I elsewhere (positions 1,4,or5), and avoids A, S, E. A good candidate is **IRONY**: I‑R‑O‑N‑Y. It satisfies all constraints (I is first, R second, no prohibited letters).

From the first guess ARISE we know:
- R is correct in position 2.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.

From the second guess IRONY we learn:
- I is not in position 1 (still in the word).
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and Y are not in the word.

So far:
- Position 2 = R.
- I must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).
- O must be somewhere other than position 3 (could be 1, 4, or 5, but not overlapping I).

A word that fits all these constraints is **ORBIT**:
- O is in position 1 (not position 3).
- R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- B is a new letter.
- I is in position 4 (allowed).
- T is a new letter.

All letters are allowed (none of A, S, E, N, Y are present). This guess will test the remaining unknown letters B and T while keeping the known constraints.
