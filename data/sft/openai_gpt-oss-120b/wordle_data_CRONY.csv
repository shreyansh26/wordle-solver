### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that the secret word has C in position 1, R in position 2, and N in position 4. Letters A and E are not present anywhere. So the pattern is C R _ N _. We need a valid English word matching this pattern. “CRUNK” (a slang term meaning energetic) fits: C‑R‑U‑N‑K, placing unknown letters U and K in positions 3 and 5. Neither U nor K have been ruled out, so this is a good next guess.

We have fixed letters from feedback:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)

Letters ruled out: A, E, U, K (all marked x).

Thus the secret word pattern is C R _ N _. The remaining unknown letters (positions 3 and 5) must be letters not yet eliminated. A good candidate is **CRONY** (C‑R‑O‑N‑Y), which fits the pattern and uses letters O and Y that have not been excluded.
