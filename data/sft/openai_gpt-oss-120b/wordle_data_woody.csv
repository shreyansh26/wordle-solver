### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, H, U, T are not in the secret word.
- The letter O is correct and in the exact third position (✓).

So the secret word looks like __O__ and must avoid the excluded letters.
Choosing a word that fits this pattern and introduces new possible letters while staying clear of the eliminated ones, “BLOOM” works:
- Pattern B L O O M matches O at position 3.
- Letters B, L, M have not been tested yet and are not among the excluded letters.
- The extra O at position 4 will help confirm whether there is a second O in the word.

Thus “BLOOM” is a valid next guess.

All letters that have received an “x” are not in the secret word:
C, R, A, N, E, S, H, U, T, B, L, M.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 2 = O (✓ from DOOZY)
- Position 3 = O (✓ from both SHOUT and DOOZY)
- Position 5 = Y (✓ from DOOZY)

All letters marked (x) are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, H, U, T, B, L, M, D, Z, plus any other previously ruled‑out letters.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are those not eliminated, such as G, F, P, Q, V, W, X, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern _ O O _ Y and using only allowed letters is **GOOFY** (G O O F Y). This will test the remaining unknown letters G and F while keeping the known correct letters in place.

Thus the next guess should be “GOOFY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, H, U, T are not in the secret word.
- The letter O is correct and in the exact third position (✓).

So the secret word looks like __O__ and must avoid the excluded letters.
Choosing a word that fits this pattern and introduces new possible letters while staying clear of the eliminated ones, “BLOOM” works:
- Pattern B L O O M matches O at position 3.
- Letters B, L, M have not been tested yet and are not among the excluded letters.
- The extra O at position 4 will help confirm whether there is a second O in the word.

Thus “BLOOM” is a valid next guess.

All letters that have received an “x” are not in the secret word:
C, R, A, N, E, S, H, U, T, B, L, M.

We need a new word with O at the third spot, another O in a different allowed position, and only using letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
A good candidate is **DOOZY**:
- Pattern D O O Z Y fits the required O at position 3 and adds a second O at position 2.
- Letters D, Z, Y have not been eliminated yet.
- This guess will test the remaining possible locations for the second O and introduce three new letters.
