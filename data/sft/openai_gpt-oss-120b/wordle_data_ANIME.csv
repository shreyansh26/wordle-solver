### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters **C** and **R** are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Contains **A** and **N** in different positions (not position 3 for A, not position 4 for N).

- E (position 5) – matches known correct position.

Thus “ANODE” is a valid next guess.

Thus the secret word is of the form **A N _ _ E**, with the two middle letters not being C, R, O, D, A, N, or E.

We need a common English word that fits this pattern. “ANGLE” (A N G L E) uses G and L, which are not excluded, and is a valid 5‑letter word.

Therefore the next guess should be **ANGLE**.

We have deduced the secret word pattern from the feedback:

- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: unknown, but cannot be S (since S was marked x in ANISE). Also cannot be any letters previously marked x: C, R, G, L, O, D, S.
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the word is **A N I _ E**. A common English word fitting this pattern and using a new, untested letter is **ANIME** (A‑N‑I‑M‑E). The letter M has not been tried yet and is allowed.

Therefore the next guess should be “ANIME”.
