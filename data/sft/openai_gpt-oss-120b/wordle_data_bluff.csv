### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both consonants and the common vowel ‘A’ plus another vowel ‘E’.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely. Choosing a common word with different letters will give the most useful information. “SOLID” uses S, O, L, I, D, none of which were eliminated, so it’s a good next guess.

- L is in the word and is correctly placed at position 2.
- U is in the word and is correctly placed at position 3.
- B is in the word but is not at position 5, so B must be at position 1 or 4.

Thus the pattern is either **B L U _ _** or **_ L U B _**.  
A common English word fitting the first pattern and using only as‑yet‑untested letters is **BLUFF** (B L U F F). It respects all constraints:
- B at position 1 (not position 5),
- L at position 2 (✓),
- U at position 3 (✓),
- F has not been guessed yet, so it provides new information.

Therefore the next guess should be “BLUFF”.
