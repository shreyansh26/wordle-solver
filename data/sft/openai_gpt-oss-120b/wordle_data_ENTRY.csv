### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RINKS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) N(-) K(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, E, I, K, S.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (and also not in positions 2 from the first guess, so N cannot be 2,3,4).

Thus possible positions:
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **NORTH**:
- N is at position 1 (allowed).
- R is at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2).
- The other letters O, T, H have not been ruled out.

So the next guess should be “NORTH”.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: A, C, E, I, K, O, S, H.
- The word must contain the letters N, R, and T.

- R can only be in positions 4 or 5 (ruled out from positions 1,2,3).
- T is present but cannot be in position 4.

Trying all position combinations, the arrangement N at position 5 and R at position 4 satisfies the positional rules.  
A word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **UTURN** (U T U R N):
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- R is at position 4 (allowed).
- T is at position 2 (allowed, not position 4).
- All other letters (U) have not been ruled out.

Thus “UTURN” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and places R and N in positions different from those ruled out.  
""RINKS"" satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R (position 1, allowed) and N (position 3, allowed).

- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus ""RINKS"" is a good next guess.
