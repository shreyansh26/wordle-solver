### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with my first guess. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter.

From the feedback:
- Position 2: U is correct.
- Position 3: N is correct.
- Position 4: C is correct.
- Position 5: H is correct.
- Position 1 is not L, and letters R, A, E are not in the word.
Thus the word must be ?UNCH. Possible options are BUNCH, MUNCH, PUNCH, HUNCH (LUNCH is ruled out because L is not in the word). None of these conflict with known exclusions. I’ll try “BUNCH” as the next guess.
