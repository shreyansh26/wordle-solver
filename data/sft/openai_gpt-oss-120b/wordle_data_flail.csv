### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that only the letter A is correct and it is in the third position. All other letters (C, R, N, E) are not in the secret word at all. So the pattern is __A__ and I must avoid using C, R, N, E in the new guess. I’ll pick a common word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not ruled out. “SHALT” (S‑H‑A‑L‑T) satisfies these constraints.

We know:

- Letters C, R, N, E, S, H, T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with A third, containing L in a allowed spot, and using none of the excluded letters.  
“FLAKY” fits perfectly:
