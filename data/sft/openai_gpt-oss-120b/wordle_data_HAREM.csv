### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on SLATE:

A good candidate is **CAGED**:

We have determined the letters and positions:
- Position 1: H (confirmed by HAVEN)
- Position 2: A (confirmed by CAGED and MAKER)
- Position 4: E (confirmed by CAGED and MAKER and HAVEN)

From earlier feedback, letters M and R are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses:
- M was guessed at position 1 in MAKER and got “-”, meaning M is elsewhere.
- R was guessed at position 5 in MAKER and got “-”, meaning R is elsewhere (cannot be position 5).

Since positions 3 and 5 are still unknown, the only way to place M and R while respecting the constraints is:
- Position 3: R (R cannot be position 5)
- Position 5: M

Thus the word fits the pattern H A R E M, which satisfies all prior feedback and uses only allowed letters.

The next guess should be “HAREM”.
