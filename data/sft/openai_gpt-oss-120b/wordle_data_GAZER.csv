### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”.
  * R cannot be in the 2nd position.
  * A cannot be in the 3rd position.
  * E cannot be in the 5th position.

We need a new word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N. “EARTH” fits:
- Contains E, A, R.
- Positions: E (1st), A (2nd), R (3rd) – all different from the banned spots.
- Uses new letters T, H for the remaining slots, which we have no information about yet.

We have the following constraints from the feedback:

1. Letter **A** is correct in position 2.
2. Letters **R** and **E** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in the guesses:
   - **R** cannot be in positions 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from EARTH). It may be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - **E** cannot be in positions 1 (from EARTH) or 5 (from CRANE). It may be in positions 3 or 4.
3. Letters **C**, **N**, **T**, and **H** are not in the word.
4. We still need two more letters that are not among the excluded ones.

A word that satisfies all these conditions is **MAKER**:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Contains **R** (position 5) and **E** (position 4), both allowed.
- Uses new letters **M** and **K**, which we have no information about yet.
- Avoids the prohibited letters C, N, T, H.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”.
  * R cannot be in the 2nd position.
  * A cannot be in the 3rd position.
  * E cannot be in the 5th position.

We need a new word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N. “EARTH” fits:
- Contains E, A, R.
- Positions: E (1st), A (2nd), R (3rd) – all different from the banned spots.
- Uses new letters T, H for the remaining slots, which we have no information about yet.
Thus “EARTH” is a logical next guess.

Guess 2: EARTH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) T(x) H(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:

1. Letter **A** is correct in position 2.
2. Letters **R** and **E** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in the guesses:
   - **R** cannot be in positions 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from EARTH). It may be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - **E** cannot be in positions 1 (from EARTH) or 5 (from CRANE). It may be in positions 3 or 4.
3. Letters **C**, **N**, **T**, and **H** are not in the word.
4. We still need two more letters that are not among the excluded ones.

A word that satisfies all these conditions is **MAKER**:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Contains **R** (position 5) and **E** (position 4), both allowed.
- Uses new letters **M** and **K**, which we have no information about yet.
- Avoids the prohibited letters C, N, T, H.

Thus “MAKER” is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have identified the secret word's pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by guess 2 and 3).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed by guess 3).
- Position 5 is R (confirmed by guess 3).
Thus the word looks like: _ A _ E R.

All letters C, N, T, H, M, K are ruled out. The remaining letters must fill positions 1 and 3 without violating any earlier “wrong position” clues. The word **LASER** fits perfectly:
- L (new, not excluded) at position 1.
- A at position 2 (correct).
- S (new, not excluded) at position 3.
- E at position 4 (correct).
- R at position 5 (correct).

Therefore, the next guess should be “LASER”.

We have determined the secret word pattern is **_ A _ E R**.

Excluded letters (based on x feedback): C, N, L, S, M, K, T, H, and also any letters marked x in their specific positions (but they are not in the word at all).  
Remaining possible letters for the first and third positions are any letters not in the excluded list.

A common English word fitting the pattern and using only allowed letters is **PAGER** (P A G E R).  
It respects all previous “‑” clues (R and E are placed away from their previously guessed spots) and introduces new letters P and G, which have not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “PAGER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is **A** (✓).
- Position 4 is **E** (✓).
- Position 5 is **R** (✓).

From the last guess (PAGER) we learned that **G** is in the word but not in position 3, so G must be in position 1.  
Thus the word looks like **G A _ E R**.

All letters marked “x” are excluded: C, N, L, S, M, K, P, T, H, etc.  
The remaining unknown third letter must be a letter not yet eliminated and that forms a valid English word.

A common word fitting the pattern is **GAZER** (G A Z E R), where Z is a new, allowed letter.

So the next guess should be “GAZER”.
