### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good choice because it includes the vowel “A” and common consonants “C”, “R”, “N”, and “E”.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct in position 1).  
Letters R, A, N are not in the word at all.  
E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in one of the middle slots (2‑4).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Has C as the first letter.
- Contains E somewhere other than the last position.
- Does not use R, A, or N.

A good candidate is **COMET**:
- Starts with C.
- Places E in the fourth position (allowed).
- Uses letters O, M, T which we have no information about yet, and avoids the excluded letters.

Thus we will guess COMET.
