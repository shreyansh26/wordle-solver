### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. It does contain the letter N, but N is NOT in the 4th position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

We have the following information:

So the disallowed letters are {A, B, C, D, E, I, R, S, T, U, X? actually X not used, but not disallowed}. The allowed letters we haven’t tested yet include: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N (already used), O (fixed), P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- The secret word must fit the pattern ***ON, with O at the 4th position and N at the 5th.

We need a real 5‑letter English word of the form ___ON using only letters that haven’t been excluded. Viable candidates are:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:

- From guess 3 (BISON) we got O(✓) and N(✓). This means O is correct in position 4 and N is correct in position 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: C, R, A, E, D, U, T, B, I, S, plus any letters that appeared with an ‘x’ in earlier guesses (C, R, A, E, D, U, T, B, I, S, plus from “DONUT”: D, U, T, plus from “CRANE”: C, R, A, E). So the disallowed letters are {A, B, C, D, E, I, R, S, T, U, X? actually X not used, but not disallowed}. The allowed letters we haven’t tested yet include: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N (already used), O (fixed), P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- The secret word must fit the pattern ***ON, with O at the 4th position and N at the 5th.

We need a real 5‑letter English word of the form ___ON using only letters that haven’t been excluded. Viable candidates are:
- PYLON (P Y L O N) – all letters are untested.
- M L O N? “MELON” uses E which is excluded.
- “CLOWN” uses C, excluded.
- “GROWN” uses R, excluded.
- “WAGON” uses A, excluded.

Thus **PYLON** satisfies all constraints and introduces three new letters (P, Y, L) for further information.
