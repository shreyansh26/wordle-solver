### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter.

All five letters from the previous guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent from the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that does not contain any of those letters. I’ll choose a common word with different letters to gather fresh information. “SLOTH” uses S, L, O, T, H – none of which appeared in the first guess, so it’s a valid next attempt.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
- From guess 2 (SLOTH): O is correct in position 3.  
  S, T, H are present but in wrong positions.  
  L is absent.

So the secret word must contain O at the third slot, and also contain S, T, and H in positions other than where they appeared in SLOTH (i.e., S not in position 1, T not in position 4, H not in position 5).  

Looking for a real English word that satisfies these constraints, “GHOST” fits perfectly:
- G H O S T → O is third.
- S is fourth (not first).
- T is fifth (not fourth).
- H is second (not fifth).
- None of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, L) appear.

Thus the next guess is **GHOST**.
