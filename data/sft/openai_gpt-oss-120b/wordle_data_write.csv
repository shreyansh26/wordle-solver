### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 2 = R (✓ from both guesses)
- Position 3 = I (✓ from guess 2)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from guess 1)

Letters known not in the word: C, A, N, P, D.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R I _ E, with position 1 and 4 unknown, and cannot be any of the excluded letters.

We need a valid English 5‑letter word matching that pattern and avoiding the excluded letters. Candidates include:
- ""TRITE"" (T R I T E) – uses T in positions 1 and 4, none of the excluded letters.
- ""GRIME"" (G R I M E) – uses M in position 4, also fits.
- ""BRI...?"" ""BRITE"" (B R I T E) – also fits.

Any of these are acceptable; I’ll choose ""TRITE"" as the next guess.
