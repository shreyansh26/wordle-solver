### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, K, and also letters from guesses that got an “x”.
- Remaining possible letters for the other positions are any not yet excluded.

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ U _.  
M must be in position 1 or 3, and L must be in a position other than 1 (so 3 or 5).  
A plausible word that fits the pattern and the known letters is **MOLUS** (M O L U S). It uses only allowed letters, places M at position 1, L at position 3, and respects the fixed O and U.

Looking for a real English word that satisfies these constraints, “LOKUM” fits:
- L O K U M
- Position 2 is O (✓).
- L is at position 1 (not position 4), satisfying the “‑” for L.
- U is at position 4 (not position 3), satisfying the “‑” for U.
- Uses only allowed letters (L, O, K, U, M) and avoids all excluded letters.

So the next logical guess is **LOKUM**.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 2 is **O** (✓).
- Position 4 is **U** (✓).
- The word contains **L** (but not at position 1).

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, K, and also letters from guesses that got an “x”.
- Remaining possible letters for the other positions are any not yet excluded.

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ U _.  
M must be in position 1 or 3, and L must be in a position other than 1 (so 3 or 5).  
A plausible word that fits the pattern and the known letters is **MOLUS** (M O L U S). It uses only allowed letters, places M at position 1, L at position 3, and respects the fixed O and U.

I’ll submit this guess to receive the next feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
