### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that will give a lot of information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a frequent choice because it contains common letters C, R, A, N, and E in varied positions.

From the feedback: C and R are not in the word, E is not in the word, A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is correct at position 4.  
So the secret word has the form _ _ _ N _. It must contain an A somewhere other than position 3, and cannot contain C, R, or E.  
A good candidate that fits these constraints is **AGONY** (A at position 1, N at position 4, no forbidden letters).

We have the following confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: A (✓ from AGONY)
- Position 3: O (✓ from AGONY)
- Position 4: N (✓ from both guesses)
- Letter G is in the word but not in position 2 (‑ from AGONY). The only remaining slot is position 5, so G must be at position 5.

Thus the word pattern is **A _ O N G**. The common English word that fits is **ALONG**.

This word respects all previous feedback (does not use excluded letters C, R, E, Y, etc.) and places G at position 5.
