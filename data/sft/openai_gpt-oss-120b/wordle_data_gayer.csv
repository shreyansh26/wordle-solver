### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know letters C and N are not in the secret word. Letters R, A, and E are present but each is in a different position than in the first guess (CRANE). In CRANE: R was in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 5. So in the next guess we must place R, A, and E in positions other than 2, 3, 5 respectively.

A good candidate is **RAVEL**:
- R is moved to position 1 (not 2)

- A is correct at position 2.
- E is correct at position 4.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from earlier guesses). Thus R must be at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
_ A _ E _ with R occupying either position 3 or 5.

We need to test the remaining unknown letters. Choosing a word that places R at position 3 will tell us if that is correct, while also introducing two new letters to evaluate. “BARED” fits the pattern (B A R E D), uses new letters B and D, and puts R at position 3.

So the next guess is BARED.

- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from earlier guesses). Thus R must be at position 5.

So the structure is: _ A _ E R.

We need to choose letters for positions 1 and 3 that have not been ruled out. A common word fitting this pattern is **WATER** (W at position 1, T at position 3). Both letters are new and valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
