### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that S, L, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter T is in the word but not in the fourth position. Therefore the next guess should contain T in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5) and avoid using S, L, A, and E. A good candidate is “TRICK,” which places T at the first position and includes only new letters.

We need a new guess respecting the constraints we have so far:
- Letters S, L, A, E, I, C, K are not in the secret word.
- The secret word contains T and R.
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from previous feedback), so T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- R cannot be in position 2.

A good next guess should test new letters while still obeying the known exclusions. The word **ROUND** uses allowed letters (R, O, U, N, D), includes R in position 1 (allowed), and introduces O, U, N, D for further clues. It does not place T, which is fine; we can still gather information about the other letters.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Excluded letters: S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, N, D.
- Letters that must be in the word: T, R, O.
- O is confirmed at position 2 (O✓).
- T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (from SLATE and TRICK). Hence T can be in positions 2,3,5; position 2 is already O, so T can be 3 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from TRICK and ROUND). Hence R can be in positions 3,4,5.

We need a 5‑letter English word with O in the second slot, containing both T and R, respecting those position constraints, and using only letters not excluded.  

The word **MOTOR** fits:
- Pattern: M O T O R
- O is at position 2 (✓).
- T is at position 3 (allowed).
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- All other letters (M, O) are not excluded.
