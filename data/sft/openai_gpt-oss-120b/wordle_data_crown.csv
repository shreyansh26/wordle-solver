We know from the feedback:
- C is correct and in the first position.
- R is correct and in the second position.
- A and E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.

Therefore the secret word looks like: C R _ _ _.  
N must be in either the third or fifth position.  
We need a word that keeps C and R correct, puts N in a new position, and introduces new letters to test.

The word **CROWN** fits:
- C (1) and R (2) stay correct.
- N moves to the fifth position (different from the previous fourth‑position placement).
- O and W are new letters to test.

So the next guess will be “crown”.
