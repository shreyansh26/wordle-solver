### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that uses a variety of common letters to give me the most information about the secret word.  
A good starter is **CRANE** because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

The feedback tells me that the secret word has A in the third position, and none of the letters C, R, N, or E appear anywhere. I need a new five‑letter word with A as the third letter and without using C, R, N, or E. “SHALT” fits these constraints (S‑H‑A‑L‑T) and introduces several new letters to test.

We know from feedback:
- A is correct at position 3.
- T is correct at position 5.
- Letters C, R, N, E, S, H, L are not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ T, using only letters not in the excluded list. We need to test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4. The word “ADAPT” fits the pattern (A D A P T): it keeps A at position 3, places T at position 5, and introduces two new letters D and P while avoiding all excluded letters. It also repeats A in position 1, which is allowed because we have no information that forbids it.

Therefore, the next guess will be ADAPT.
