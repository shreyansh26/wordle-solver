### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters, so the feedback will give me useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter: it includes a common vowel (A, E) and several consonants (C, R, N) that often appear in English words. This will help identify correct letters and positions early on.

We know from the feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3 in ""CRANE"").

So the secret word must contain R and A somewhere else. We need a new guess that:
1. Includes R and A in different positions than before.
2. Avoids the excluded letters C, N, E.
3. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

""RADIO"" fits these criteria:
- R is at position 1 (different from previous position 2).
- A is at position 2 (different from previous position 3).
- It adds D, I, O as new letters.
- It does not contain C, N, or E.

Thus, ""RADIO"" is a good next guess.

- The fifth letter is not O, and also not any of the letters C, N, E which were already ruled out.
We need a word that keeps R A D I in the first four spots and introduces a plausible new fifth letter. “RADAR” fits this pattern and uses a common letter (R) that hasn’t been ruled out, allowing us to see if the secret word ends with R.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the first four letters are definitely R A D I from the perfect matches in Guess 2.  
Guess 3 (RADAR) tells us the 5th letter is not R (it’s marked “-”), and also confirms that A is not in position 4.  
Therefore the secret word is of the form **R A D I _** where the final letter is not O, R, A, D, I, C, N, or E.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **RADIX**, introducing the new letter X.

We have determined the secret word has the pattern R A D I _. The first four letters are confirmed from Guess 2 (RADIO) as correct. All other letters guessed (C, N, E, O, X) are not in the word. The only plausible 5‑letter English word that fits “RADI?” and uses only allowed letters is **RADII**, where the final letter is another I. This introduces no new disallowed letters and matches all feedback so far.
