### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and N in different positions from those used in CRANE, and cannot contain C, R, or E. I need a new word that includes A and N and avoids the excluded letters while giving new letters to test. “BANJO” satisfies these constraints (B A N J O) – it has A (pos2) and N (pos3), no C/R/E, and introduces B, J, O for more information.

We have the pattern _ A N D Y with positions 2-5 fixed as A, N, D, Y respectively. The first letter cannot be any of the letters marked absent: C, R, E, B, J, O, M, L, S. Viable common letters include H, G, P, T, etc. The word ""HANDY"" fits the pattern, uses H which hasn't been ruled out, and is a common English word. This guess will test the first letter.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and N in different positions from those used in CRANE, and cannot contain C, R, or E. I need a new word that includes A and N and avoids the excluded letters while giving new letters to test. “BANJO” satisfies these constraints (B A N J O) – it has A (pos2) and N (pos3), no C/R/E, and introduces B, J, O for more information.

Thus the word pattern is _ A N _ _. Positions 1, 4, and 5 need new letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good guess that tests three fresh, common letters is **MANLY** (M A N L Y), which respects the known A and N placements and introduces M, L, and Y.
