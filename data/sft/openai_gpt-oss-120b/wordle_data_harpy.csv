### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Word “HARDY” fits: H A R D Y.
- A is at position 2 (correct).
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- H, D, Y are all still untested and not excluded.

Thus “HARDY” is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed the following from feedback:
- Position 1 = H (✓)
- Position 2 = A (✓)
- Position 3 = R (✓)
- Position 5 = Y (✓)
- Position 4 is still unknown.
Letters eliminated (x) are: C, N, E, I, L, S, M, J, O, D.
Thus the secret word fits the pattern **H A R _ Y** with a fourth letter that is not any of the eliminated letters. The common word that matches this pattern is **HARPY** (P is a new, allowed letter). This will test the remaining unknown slot.
