### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that the secret word must contain the letters C, A, and N, but not R or E. Additionally:
- C cannot be in position 1 (the first letter of CRANE).
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a five‑letter word that includes C, A, N, respects those position restrictions, and uses two other letters that are not R or E.

The word **ANTIC** works:
- Contains A, N, and C.
- Positions: A (1), N (2), T (3), I (4), C (5).
- C is not in position 1, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.
- No R or E appear.

Thus “ANTIC” is a valid next guess.

We have deduced the following constraints from the feedback:

- The secret word ends with **I C** (positions 4 and 5 are I and C respectively).
- It contains the letters **A** and **N** somewhere else.
- **A** cannot be in position 1 (from “ANTIC”) and cannot be in position 3 (from “CRANE”), so A must be in position 2.
- **N** cannot be in position 2 (from “ANTIC”) and cannot be in position 4 (from “CRANE”), so N must be either in position 1 or 3.
- Positions 4 and 5 are fixed as I and C.

Thus the word pattern is **_ A _ I C**, with N occupying either the first or third slot.

A common English word that fits this pattern and places N in the third position is **MANIC** (M A N I C).

We’ll guess “MANIC” to test the remaining unknown letters.
