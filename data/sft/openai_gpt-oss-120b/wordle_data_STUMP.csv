### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have excluded letters from previous feedback: C, R, A, N, E, L, I, G, H. So far the only known letter is T, which is present but not in position 5 (since in LIGHT it was at position 5 and got a minus). Therefore T must be somewhere in positions 1‑4.

We need a new word that:
- Contains T in a position 1‑4.
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- Introduces new letters to test.

Considering remaining alphabet (B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), a good candidate is **SMUTS**:
- T is at position 4 (valid).
- Other letters (S, M, U) are not yet ruled out.
- No excluded letters appear.

Thus we will guess SMUTS.

  * M is absent.
  * U at position 3 is correct (✓).
  * T at position 4 is present but in the wrong spot (‑), and from LIGHT we know T is also not at position 5. The only remaining position for T is position 2.
  * The second S (position 5) is absent, confirming that there is only one S, already fixed at position 1.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **S T U _ _** with the last two letters not yet identified. Eliminated letters are C, R, A, N, E, L, I, G, H, M. Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word that fits the pattern is **STUFF** (S‑T‑U‑F‑F), using only letters that have not been ruled out.

I will guess that word.

We have determined the secret word pattern is S T U _ _. The letters S, T, and U are confirmed in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Letters F, C, R, A, N, E, L, I, G, H, M have been ruled out, and there is only one S (the second S in SMUTS was marked absent). The remaining two positions need letters not yet eliminated. A common English word fitting the pattern is **STUDY** (S‑T‑U‑D‑Y), using D and Y, which have not been tried and are not among the excluded letters. This guess will test those letters and potentially solve the puzzle.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
