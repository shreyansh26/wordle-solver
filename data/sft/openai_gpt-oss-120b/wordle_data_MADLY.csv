### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, N, or E. It DOES contain the letter A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position (where it was in CRANE). Therefore the next guess must:
- Include the letter A in a different position (1,2,4, or 5).
- Exclude C, R, N, and E entirely.
Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints will give us new information about the remaining letters. “BALMY” is a valid 5‑letter word, contains A in the 2nd position, and avoids C, R, N, and E.

- From ""BALMY"": B is not in the word; A is correct at position 2; L and M are in the word but in different positions than guessed; Y is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y, with the letters L and M somewhere in the remaining slots, where L cannot be at position 3 and M cannot be at position 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **MAILY**:
- M at position 1 (allowed, M cannot be in position 4).

- I at position 3 (unknown but allowed).
- L at position 4 (allowed, L is not at position 3).
