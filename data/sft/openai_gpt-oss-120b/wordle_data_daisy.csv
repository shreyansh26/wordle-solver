### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Thus we need a new word that includes A in a different position (1,2,4,or5) and avoids the excluded letters. Choosing ""BALMY"":
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces four new letters B, L, M, Y to gather more info.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Letter S is known to be in the word but not in position 3 (feedback showed S(-) at position 3 in TASTY). Therefore S must be at position 1 or 4.

All letters that received an “x” are not in the secret word: C, R, N, E, B, L, M, H, P, G, W, K, T.

Remaining possible letters are D, F, I, J, O, Q, S, U, V, X, Z, etc.

A fitting common word is **SAVVY** (S A V V Y):

- Introduces new letters V that have not been ruled out.
- Meets the pattern _ A _ _ Y.
