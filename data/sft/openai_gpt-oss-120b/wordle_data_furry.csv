### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the confirmed positions:
- 2nd letter U (✓)
- 3rd letter R (✓)
- 5th letter Y (✓)

The 4th letter is not K (excluded) and not U. The 1st letter is still unknown. Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, E, W, O, L, D, S, H, B, M, K, plus any letters that got an ""x"" in previous guesses.

So the pattern is _ U R _ Y.

Possible common English words fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters are:
- FURRY (F U R R Y)
- PURRY (P U R R Y)

Both introduce a new first letter (F or P) and keep R in the fourth position, which we have not yet tested. Choosing one will let us confirm the first letter and also verify whether the fourth position is indeed R.

I will guess **FURRY**.
