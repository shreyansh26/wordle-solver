### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to give useful information for later guesses. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in these word games because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two frequent vowels (A, E) and three common consonants. This should provide a good spread of information for the next steps.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, N, and E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and A in different positions from those ruled out, and avoids C, N, E.  
Choosing “RAILS” places R at position 1 (allowed) and A at position 2 (allowed). The remaining letters I, L, S give us new information without using any excluded letters.

From previous feedback:
- C, N, E, I, L, S are not in the word.
- A is correct at position 2.
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (guess 2) and not at position 2 (occupied by A). So R can be at positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need a new word with A in the second slot and R somewhere else, while avoiding the excluded letters. “PARTY” fits: P A R T Y.
- Keeps A at position 2.
- Places R at position 3 (one of the possible spots).
- Introduces three new letters (P, T, Y) that haven’t been ruled out.

Thus “PARTY” is a logical next guess.
