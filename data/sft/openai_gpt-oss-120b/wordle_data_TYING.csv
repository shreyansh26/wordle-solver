### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that only the letter N is correct and it is in the 4th position of the secret word. All other letters from CRANE (C, R, A, E) are not in the word at any position. Therefore we need a new 5‑letter word with N as the fourth letter and none of C, R, A, E anywhere else.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 2: unknown, cannot be any letters marked x: C,R,A,E,S,W,F,L,H.
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- Position 5: G (✓)

Thus the word is T _ I N G. The only common 5‑letter English word fitting this pattern and using a new letter for position 2 is **TYING** (T‑Y‑I‑N‑G). The letter Y has not been tried and is not excluded.
