### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from previous feedback:
- Position 1 is R (✓).
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- D, C, N, E are not in the word.
- The second A (position 4 in “RADAR”) got a “-”, meaning there is another A elsewhere (not at position 4).
- The second R (position 5 in “RADAR”) got a “-”, meaning there is another R elsewhere (not at position 5).

Thus the secret word starts with **RA** and contains at least one more A (not in position 4) and at least one more R (not in position 5).  
We need a new valid 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints and introduces fresh letters to gather more information.  
“RAILS” satisfies all known restrictions:
- Begins with R A.
- Uses none of the excluded letters (C, N, E, D).
- Places new letters I, L, S in positions 3‑5, letting us test those slots without violating the known “‑” clues (A not at 4, R not at 5).

So the next guess will be “RAILS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
