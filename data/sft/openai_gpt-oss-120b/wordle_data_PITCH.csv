### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I want to start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to give me useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it covers two vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N). This should help identify many possible letters early.

From the first guess, the feedback tells me:

- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain a C somewhere in positions 2‑5, and must avoid R, A, N, E. I’ll choose a word that places C in a new position and uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. “SCOUT” puts C in the second slot and introduces S, O, U, T, all of which are still possible.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → C is in the word but not in position 1.

- Guess 3: THICK → C is correct in position 4; T, H, I are in the word but each is in the wrong position; K is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have **C** at position 4.
- Contain **T**, **H**, **I** somewhere else.
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (wrong in THICK and SCOUT), so T must be at 2 or 3.
- H cannot be in position 2 (wrong in THICK), so H can be 1, 3, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3 (wrong in THICK), so I can be 1, 2, or 5.
- No letters R, A, N, E, S, O, U, K are allowed.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **HITCH**:
- Pattern H I T C H → C is fourth.
- T is third (allowed), H is first and fifth (allowed), I is second (allowed).
- Uses only the allowed letters H, I, T, C.

Therefore the next logical guess is “HITCH”.

Guess 2: SCOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) U(x) T(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters C and T are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed. From the feedback:
- C is not in positions 1 or 2.
- T is not in position 5.
All other letters guessed (R, A, N, E, S, O, U) are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C and T, with C in position 3‑5 (but not 1‑2) and T not in position 5. All other letters must be from the remaining unused alphabet.

The word **THICK** satisfies:
- Contains C (position 4) and T (position 1).
- No banned letters (R, A, N, E, S, O, U) appear.
- C is not in positions 1 or 2, and T is not in position 5.

Thus THICK is a consistent next guess.

Guess 3: THICK -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(-) I(-) C(✓) K(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → C is in the word but not in position 1.
- Guess 2: SCOUT → C is still in the word but not in position 2; T is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 3: THICK → C is correct in position 4; T, H, I are in the word but each is in the wrong position; K is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have **C** at position 4.
- Contain **T**, **H**, **I** somewhere else.
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (wrong in THICK and SCOUT), so T must be at 2 or 3.
- H cannot be in position 2 (wrong in THICK), so H can be 1, 3, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3 (wrong in THICK), so I can be 1, 2, or 5.
- No letters R, A, N, E, S, O, U, K are allowed.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **HITCH**:
- Pattern H I T C H → C is fourth.
- T is third (allowed), H is first and fifth (allowed), I is second (allowed).
- Uses only the allowed letters H, I, T, C.

Therefore the next logical guess is “HITCH”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
