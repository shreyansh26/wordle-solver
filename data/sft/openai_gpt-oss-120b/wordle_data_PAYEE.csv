### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E**, contains **A** somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and does not contain C, R, or N.

I’ll choose a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters: **PAUSE** (A is in position 2, E is position 5, and P, U, S are new letters).

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: P (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, U, S.

Thus the secret pattern is **P A _ _ E** with the 3rd and 4th letters being any letters except the excluded ones (and could include duplicates of P, A, or E). 

A common English word fitting this pattern and respecting the exclusions is **PAYEE** (P A Y E E). It introduces a new letter Y and uses E again in position 4, which is still possible.

I'll guess PAYEE.
