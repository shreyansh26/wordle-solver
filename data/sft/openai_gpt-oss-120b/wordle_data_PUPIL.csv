### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have eliminated letters C,R,A,N,E,S,H,O,T from the secret word. The only known letter is U, which is present but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in guess ""SHOUT""). Therefore U must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains U in one of those allowed positions.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

Considering the remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), a good candidate is **PLUMB**:
- Positions: P(1) L(2) U(3) M(4) B(5)
- U is in position 3, satisfying the “not 4” condition.
- All letters (P, L, U, M, B) are currently untested and not excluded.

Thus PLUMB is a strategic next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have:
- Position 1 is definitely **P** (P was a green check).
- **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (L got a yellow in PLUMB).
- **U** is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (U got a yellow in both SHOUT and PLUMB), so U can only be in position 2 or 5.
- Eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,H,O,M,B,T plus any others already marked x.

We need a new five‑letter word starting with P, containing L and U in allowed spots, and introducing fresh letters to test further.  
**PULPY** fits:
- P (1) matches the known placement.
- U (2) puts U in an allowed position (2, not 3‑4).
- L (3) puts L in an allowed position (not 2).
- Y (5) is a new letter to test, and the second P repeats the known P but is harmless.

Thus the guess respects all constraints and gives us more information.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1 = P (green from PLUMB and PULPY).
- Position 2 = U (green from PULPY).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (yellow in PLUMB and PULPY), so L can be at position 4 or 5.
- The second P is present (yellow at position 4 in PULPY), so there is at least one more P somewhere other than position 1 and not at position 4. That leaves positions 3 or 5 for the extra P.
- Eliminated letters (gray): C, R, A, N, E, S, H, O, T, M, B, Y, plus any other letters not yet tried.

We need a guess that respects the known greens, includes L and a possible second P in allowed spots, and adds a new letter to test further.  
The word **PUPIL** fits:
- P (1) green ✅
- U (2) green ✅
- P (3) tests the second P possibility.
- I (4) introduces a fresh letter not yet ruled out.
- L (5) places L in one of its allowed positions.

Thus “PUPIL” is a logical next guess.
