### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that only the second letter L is correct. The letters S, A, T, and E are not in the word at any position. Therefore the next guess must have L in the second slot and avoid using S, A, T, or E elsewhere. A suitable word fitting these constraints is **CLING** (C L I N G), which uses none of the excluded letters.

We have:
- Position 2 is confirmed as L.
- Letters S, A, T, E, C, N, G are not in the word.
- Letter I is in the word but not at position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word with L in the second slot, containing I somewhere other than the third slot, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **PLOID** fits:
- Pattern: P L O I D (L is second).
- Contains I at the fourth position (so it’s not in position 3).
- Uses only allowed letters (P, L, O, I, D) and none of the forbidden letters.

Thus the next guess is “PLOID”.
