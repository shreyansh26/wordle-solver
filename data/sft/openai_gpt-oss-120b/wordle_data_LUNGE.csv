2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good starter word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give informative feedback. 
“CRANE” includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, E and covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. This should provide a solid base for the next steps.

We know:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (‑). So N could be 1,2,3, or 5, but 5 is already E, so N is 1,2, or 3.
- Letters C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).

We need a new 5‑letter word containing N (not at position 4) and ending with E, while avoiding C, R, A. A good candidate is **LUNGE**:
- Contains N at position 3 (acceptable).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only new letters L, U, G besides the known N and E.
- No prohibited letters.

Thus we will guess LUNGE.
