### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A. It does contain N and E, but N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5 (their positions in CRANE).

Thus **UNMET** is a valid next guess.

- M is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.

Letter N is present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it appeared in those spots in previous guesses). Thus N must be in position 1 or 5.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, D, S, U, T.

We need a word of the form _ _ M E _. Placing N at position 1 gives pattern N _ M E _. The remaining letters must be unused and not excluded. “NOMEN” fits:
- N at 1 (allowed),
- O (new),
- M at 3 (correct),
- E at 4 (correct),
- N at 5 (allowed, N can also occupy 5).

All letters are permissible, so “NOMEN” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:

- Position 2: O is correct (✓).
- Position 3: M is correct (✓).
- Position 4: E is correct (✓).
- Position 5: N is correct (✓).
- Position 1: N is marked as present but not in this position, meaning the secret word contains N (already satisfied at position 5) and the first letter cannot be N. It must also avoid any letters previously marked as absent: C, R, A, D, S, U, T, etc.

So the word format is _ O M E N, with the first letter being a new, unused letter that isn’t excluded. “WOMEN” fits perfectly and uses a valid, common English word.

Thus the next guess is WOMEN.
