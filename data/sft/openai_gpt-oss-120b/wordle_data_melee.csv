### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: only E at position 5 is correct. Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- From SLIDE: S, I, D are not in the word. L is present but not in position 2. E is again confirmed at position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains the letter **L** somewhere other than position 2, and must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, S, I, D.  

We need a 5‑letter English word ending in E, with L in position 1, 3, or 4.  
A suitable candidate is **BELLE** (B E L L E): it ends with E, places L at positions 3 and 4, and uses only new letters B and the already‑known E. No forbidden letters appear.

So the next guess will be BELLE.

We have the following feedback:

2. SLIDE → E is correct at position 5, L is in the word but not in position 2. S, I, D are absent.
3. BELLE → B is absent. E is correct at position 2 and at position 5. L is correct at position 3, and the L in position 4 is present elsewhere (so the word contains an L, just not at position 4).

From this we know:
- Position 2 = E
- Position 3 = L
