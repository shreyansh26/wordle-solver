### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me:
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, and T are not in the word at all.

So the secret pattern is _ _ _ _ E, with S somewhere other than the first slot. I’ll choose a word that ends with E, includes an S not at the start, and avoids L, A, and T. “ROUSE” fits: R O U S E, with S in position 4 and E correctly placed.

A good candidate that fits all constraints and introduces new letters is **CHOSE**:
