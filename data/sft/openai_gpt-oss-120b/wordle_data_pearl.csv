### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess SLATE:
- S is not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must have A at the third slot, contain both L and E (with L not in slot 2 and E not in slot 5), and must not contain S or T.

Looking for a common 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints, “REALM” fits:
- R E A L M
- A is at position 3 (correct).
- L is at position 4 (not position 2) – good.
- E is at position 2 (not position 5) – good.
- No S or T present.

Thus “REALM” is a valid next guess.

L is known to be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from SLATE, REALM, LEARN). The only remaining slot for L is position 5.

Thus the word pattern is _ E A R L.

A common English word matching this pattern is **PEARL** (P‑E‑A‑R‑L), which also introduces a new letter P that hasn't been ruled out.
