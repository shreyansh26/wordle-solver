### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- I is correct at position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not at positions 1, 2, 4 → must be position 3.
- N is in the word but not at positions 1, 3, 4 → must be position 5.
Thus the pattern is _ I R _ N.

Letters proven absent: C, A, E, G, S, T, O.  
Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are any not excluded.

A common word fitting the pattern is **MIRIN** (a Japanese seasoning). It uses only letters not ruled out and satisfies the known placements:
- M at position 1,
- I at position 2 (✓),
- R at position 3,
- I at position 4,

We have confirmed letters from previous feedback:
- I is correct at position 2 (✓).
- R is correct at position 3 (✓).
- N is correct at position 5 (✓).
- Position 4 cannot be I (the second I in MIRIN was marked ‘-’), and letters C, A, E, G, S, T, O, M are ruled out.

Thus the current pattern is _ I R _ N.  
We need a common 5‑letter word that matches this pattern using only letters not yet eliminated.  
“PIRIN” fits perfectly:
- P (new letter, not excluded) at position 1,

- R at position 3 (✓),
- I at position 4, which is allowed to be marked ‘-’ because I already appears elsewhere,

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
