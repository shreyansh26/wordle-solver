### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- CRANE: all letters absent.
- GHOST: all letters absent.
- BLIMP: B absent, L present but wrong position (position 2), I absent, M absent, P present but wrong position (position 5).

Thus the secret word contains L and P, but L is not in slot 2 and P is not in slot 5. All other letters used so far (C,R,A,N,E,G,H,O,S,T,B,I,M) are definitely not in the word.

We need a word that:
1. Includes both L and P.
2. Places L somewhere other than the 2nd position.
3. Places P somewhere other than the 5th position.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A valid English word meeting these constraints is **PULPY**:
- Contains P, U, L, P, Y.
- L is in position 3 (not 2).
- P is in positions 1 and 4 (not 5).
- All letters (P, U, L, Y) are still possible.
