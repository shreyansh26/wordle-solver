### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from the feedback:

- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: G (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

The only unknown is position 4, which cannot be V (marked x). We also know the letters C, R, N, L, D, S, T, V are not present anywhere.

We need a common 5‑letter word of the form **A G A _ E** with a fourth letter that isn’t any of the excluded letters. The word **AGAPE** fits perfectly (A‑G‑A‑P‑E), introducing the new letter P, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be “AGAPE”.
