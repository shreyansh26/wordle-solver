### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know N is correct at position 4. All letters C, R, A, E, M, O, U, D are not in the word. So we need a word of the form ___N_ using only remaining letters. Choosing a word that introduces new common letters will give the most information. “SLING” (S L I N G) fits the pattern, uses none of the excluded letters, and tests four new letters.

We know from feedback that letters at positions 2,3,4 are L, I, N respectively, and N is confirmed at position 4 from the very first guess. All other letters tried so far (C,R,A,E,M,O,U,D,S,G) are not in the word. Therefore the secret word fits the pattern _ L I N _. We need a common English word that matches this pattern and uses none of the excluded letters. ""FLINT"" fits: F L I N T, with F and T being new letters we haven't tested and both are allowed.
