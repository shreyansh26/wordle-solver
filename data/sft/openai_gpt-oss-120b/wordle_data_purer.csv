### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).

We need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions, and avoids C, A, N. A good choice is “QUERY”, which places E at position 3 and R at position 4, introducing several new letters (Q, U, Y) while respecting the known constraints.

We have feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, A, N are not in the word; R is in the word but not position 2; E is in the word but not position 5.
- From ""query"": Q, Y are not in the word; U is correct at position 2; E is in the word but not position 3; R is in the word but not position 4.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have **U** in the second position.
- Contain **R** somewhere other than positions 2 or 4 (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Contain **E** somewhere other than positions 3 or 5 (so positions 1, 2, or 4). Position 2 is already U, so E can be at 1 or 4.
- Exclude the letters C, A, N, Q, Y, and also Q, Y confirmed absent.

Choose a word that respects these constraints, includes both R and E, and introduces new letters for more information.  
Word **PURER** fits:
- Pattern P U R E R → U is correctly placed at position 2.
- R appears at positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).
- E appears at position 4 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters P and does not use any forbidden letters.

Therefore the next guess is **PURER**.
