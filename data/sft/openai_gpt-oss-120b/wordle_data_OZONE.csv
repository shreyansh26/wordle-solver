### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed O in position 3, N in position 4, and E in position 5 (feedback from PHONE). The allowed letters for positions 1‑2 are those not yet marked as absent (x).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- Position 5 is E (✓).
- G and M are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in position 2, and cannot be in positions 1 (G) or 5 (E); therefore N must be in position 4.

Thus the pattern is __ONE, with N confirmed at position 4.

Based on the feedback, the confirmed letters are:
- O in position 3
- N in position 4
- E in position 5

The first two positions are still unknown, but the letters that have been marked “x” only tell us they are not in those specific spots, not that they are absent entirely.  
A common English word fitting the pattern **__ONE** and respecting the position‑specific “x” clues is **SHONE** (S 1, H 2, O 3, N 4, E 5). This word does not place any previously “x”‑marked letters in the same spots they were ruled out, and it satisfies all confirmed positions.

Therefore, the next guess should be:
