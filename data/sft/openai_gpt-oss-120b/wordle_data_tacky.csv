### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the word guessing game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving useful information for the next steps.

We know from feedback:
- The secret word contains C and A.
- C is not in position 1.
- A is not in position 3.
- Letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a new 5‑letter word that includes C and A, places C somewhere other than the first slot and A somewhere other than the third slot, and avoids R, N, and E.

A good candidate is **TACOS**:
- Contains A (position 2) – allowed.
- Contains C (position 3) – allowed (C is not first).
- Uses only letters T, O, S besides A and C, none of which are disallowed.

Thus it satisfies all constraints and gives new information for the next step.

We have confirmed that the first three letters are T A C in the correct positions. The secret word pattern is:

1️⃣ T  
2️⃣ A  
3️⃣ C  
4️⃣ ?  
5️⃣ ?

Letters O and S are not in the word (from guess 2), and R, N, E are also ruled out (from guess 1). The remaining unknown positions must be filled with letters other than O, S, R, N, E.

A common English word fitting the pattern “TAC??” is **TACKY** (T A C K Y). It introduces two new letters K and Y, both of which have not been eliminated yet, letting us learn the final two letters.

We will guess “TACKY”.
