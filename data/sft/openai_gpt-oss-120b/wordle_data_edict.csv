### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have two rounds of feedback.

1. From CRANE: C is in the word but not in position 1 (C‑); R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5 (E‑).
2. From PECKS: P, K, S are not in the word; E is again in the word but not in position 2 (E‑); C is in the word but not in position 3 (C‑).

Thus the secret word must contain **C** and **E**, with the following positional restrictions:
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
All other letters used so far (R, A, N, P, K, S) are ruled out.

We need a 5‑letter English word that contains C and E, respects those position rules, and uses only letters not yet excluded.  
The word **BLECH** satisfies all conditions:
- B L E C H → C is in position 4 (allowed), E is in position 3 (allowed).
- It contains no prohibited letters (R, A, N, P, K, S).

So the next guess will be BLECH.

We have determined from the feedback:
- C is correct at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at positions 2, 3, 5, so it must be at position 1.
- All other letters guessed (R, A, N, P, K, S, B, L, H) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **E _ _ C _**.  
A common English word matching this pattern and using only unused letters is **EDICT** (E‑D‑I‑C‑T).

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters D, I, and T while confirming the known positions.
