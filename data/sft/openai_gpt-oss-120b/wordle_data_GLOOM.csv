### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, I, H, T are not in the word.
- M and G are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in the guess ""MIGHT"":
  * M was guessed in position 1 → M cannot be the first letter.
  * G was guessed in position 3 → G cannot be the third letter.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes both M and G, avoids all excluded letters, and respects the position constraints.

A common word that fits is **GLOOM**:
- Contains G (position 1, allowed) and M (position 5, allowed).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (G, L, O, M are all still possible).
- No excluded letters appear.

Thus ""GLOOM"" is a valid next guess.
