### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains frequently used letters, giving me a good chance to learn which letters are in the secret word and their positions. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it includes the common letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering a mix of consonants and a vowel. This will give useful feedback for the next guesses.

From the first guess “CRANE” we learned:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters N and E, placed elsewhere. A good next guess should keep N and E but move them to different spots, and avoid C, R, A. “ENVOY” does exactly that: E in position 1, N in position 2, and uses new letters V, O, Y to test more possibilities.
