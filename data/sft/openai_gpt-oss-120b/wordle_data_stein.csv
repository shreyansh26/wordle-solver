### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter English word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.  
“CRANE” is a popular initial guess in word‑guessing games because it covers the common letters C, R, A, N, and E, including both a vowel (A, E) and frequently used consonants. This should provide a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first guess CRANE that C, R, and A are not in the secret word. N and E are in the word but are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively. Therefore, the next guess should contain N and E in different positions, and avoid C, R, and A.

We know the secret word contains the letters N, E, and S (each marked as present but in wrong positions). 
Constraints from feedback:
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (was at 4 in CRANE and 3 in LENDS). It can be 1, 2, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (was at 5 in CRANE and 2 in LENDS). It can be 1, 3, or 4.
- S cannot be in position 5 (was at 5 in LENDS). It can be 1‑4.

All other letters guessed (C, R, A, L, D) are not in the word.

A good next guess should place N, E, and S in positions that obey these restrictions while introducing new letters to test other possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess CRANE that C, R, and A are not in the secret word. N and E are in the word but are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively. Therefore, the next guess should contain N and E in different positions, and avoid C, R, and A. A good candidate is “LENDS”: it includes N and E (in new spots), and adds new letters L, D, and S to gather more information.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LENDS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) N(-) D(x) S(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know the secret word contains the letters N, E, and S (each marked as present but in wrong positions). 
Constraints from feedback:
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (was at 4 in CRANE and 3 in LENDS). It can be 1, 2, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (was at 5 in CRANE and 2 in LENDS). It can be 1, 3, or 4.
- S cannot be in position 5 (was at 5 in LENDS). It can be 1‑4.

All other letters guessed (C, R, A, L, D) are not in the word.

A good next guess should place N, E, and S in positions that obey these restrictions while introducing new letters to test other possibilities.  
The word **UNSEW** fits:
- U (new) at position 1
- N at position 2 (allowed)
- S at position 3 (allowed)
- E at position 4 (allowed)
- W (new) at position 5

Thus UNSEW gives us fresh information about U and W and tests N, S, E in valid spots.

Guess 2: LENDS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) N(-) D(x) S(-)
Guess 3: UNSEW -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) S(-) E(-) W(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: N and E are in the word but not in positions 4 (N) and 5 (E).
- From LENDS: E not in position 2, N not in position 3, S not in position 5.
- From UNSEW: N not in position 2, S not in position 3, E not in position 4.

Combining these, the possible positions are:
- N can be only in position 1 or 5.
- E can be only in position 1 or 3.
- S can be only in position 1, 2, or 4.

Choosing a word that respects these constraints and also introduces new letters gives us a better chance to locate the remaining letters.  
The word **SKEIN** fits:
- S is in position 1 (allowed),
- K is a new letter,
- E is in position 3 (allowed),
- I is a new letter,
- N is in position 5 (allowed).

Thus this guess tests the remaining possibilities while checking two fresh letters.

We have identified the exact positions of four letters:
- Position 1: S (✓ from guess 4)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: I (✓)
- Position 5: N (✓)

The only unknown slot is position 2.  
All letters that have been marked as absent are: C, R, A, L, D, U, W, K, plus any other letters not yet tried.  
We need a common 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern **S _ E I N** and uses a new letter for the second spot.

The word **STEIN** fits perfectly:
- S‑T‑E‑I‑N matches the known letters.
- T has not been guessed before, so it will give new information.

Thus the next logical guess is “STEIN”.
