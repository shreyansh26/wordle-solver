### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word using other frequent letters. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, T, none of which have been ruled out.

We have the following feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): all letters are not in the secret word → C, R, A, N, E are excluded.
- Guess 2 (MIGHT): M, G, H are excluded; I and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (I is not position 2, T is not position 5).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters I and T, avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H, and place I somewhere other than position 2 and T somewhere other than position 5.

Choosing a word that meets these constraints, uses only allowed letters, and is a valid English word, “SLITS” works:
- Letters: S, L, I, T, S – all allowed.
- I is at position 3 (not 2) and T is at position 4 (not 5).

Therefore the next guess is “SLITS”.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ L I T _. Positions 1 and 5 must be letters that have not been ruled out.
