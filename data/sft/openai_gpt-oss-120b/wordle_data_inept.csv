### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- N is correct at position 2 (from ENJOY feedback).
- E is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5 (dash on both guesses), so possible positions are 3 or 4.
- Letters C, R, A, J, O, Y are not in the word (marked x).
We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ N _ _ _, containing E at position 3 or 4, and avoiding the excluded letters.

A suitable candidate is **INLET**:
- Pattern: I N L E T → N is at position 2.
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters appear.
Thus INLET is a valid next guess.
