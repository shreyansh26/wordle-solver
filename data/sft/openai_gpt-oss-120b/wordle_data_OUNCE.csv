### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback: C(-) meaning C is in the word but not first position. N(-) meaning N is in the word but not fourth position. R and A are not in the word. E is correct at position 5. So pattern is _ _ _ _ E with C somewhere except position 1, N somewhere except position 4. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is ""UNCLE"": U N C L E. This places N at position 2 and C at position 3, both allowed, and ends with E.

We have letters C, N, U in the word, plus E at the final position. Constraints:
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 3, so possible at 2 or 4.
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4, so possible at 1 or 3.
- U cannot be in position 1, so possible at 2,3,4.
Trying placements, the combination C at 4, N at 3, U at 2 satisfies all constraints, leaving position 1 for an unknown letter. The word pattern becomes _ U N C E. The common English word that fits is **OUNCE**. This respects all previous feedback and avoids the excluded letters (R, A, L). Therefore the next guess should be OUNCE.
