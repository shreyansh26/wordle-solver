### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has:
- O correct at position 2
- E correct at position 4
- R correct at position 5
Letters excluded: C, A, N, T, S, J, K, P, W, plus any others marked x.

Pattern is _ O _ E R.  
We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Choosing a word that introduces two new letters gives the most information.  
“MOVER” (M O V E R) fits the pattern, uses new letters M and V, and respects all exclusions.

So the next guess will be:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tries new letters.

A good candidate is **ROTES**:
- R at position 1 (different from position 2).
- E at position 4 (different from position 5).
- New letters O, T, S give more information.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus we’ll guess “ROTES”.

- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, S.
We need a word fitting the pattern _ O _ E _. Possible placements for R: either _ O R E _ or _ O _ E R.
Choosing a word that introduces new letters while respecting the constraints, ""JOKER"" fits:
- J O K E R → O at 2, E at 4, R at 5 (allowed), and introduces J, K which we haven’t tested.
All letters are allowed (none of them are in the excluded list).
