### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know C, R, A are not in the word. N and E are present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (from “CRANE”). So the next guess must include N and E in different positions, avoid C,R,A, and can test new letters. A good candidate is “ENVOY”, placing E at position 1 and N at position 2, while introducing V, O, Y for more information.

Feedback so far:
- Letters C, R, A, V, O are not in the word.
- Y is correct at position 5.
- N is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4 → possible positions 1 or 3.
- E is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5 → possible positions 2, 3, or 4.

A word that fits these constraints and uses N and E in allowed spots is **TENTY** (pattern: ? E N ? Y). This respects all known placements and avoids excluded letters.

- N is in the word but cannot be in positions 2,3,4 (from ENVOY, TENTY, CRANE). The only remaining slot for N is position 1.
