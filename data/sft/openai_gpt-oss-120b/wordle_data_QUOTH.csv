### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with an initial guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes common consonants C, R, N and two vowels A, E. This should give useful feedback.

The feedback from the first guess indicates that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that excludes all of those letters. Choosing a word with common remaining letters will give us the most information. “SPOIL” uses S, P, O, I, and L, none of which have been ruled out, so it’s a good next guess.

We have the following feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): all letters are absent.
- Guess 2 (SPOIL): O is correct and in the exact third position; all other letters are absent.

Thus the secret word contains O at position 3, and none of the letters C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L are in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word with O in the third slot, using only letters that have not been eliminated.  
Possible remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O in the middle).

A valid English word fitting these constraints is **QUOTH** (Q U O T H). It places O correctly at position 3 and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

So the next guess is QUOTH.
