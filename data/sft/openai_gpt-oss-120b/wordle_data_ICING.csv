### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich word to get information about the secret word’s letters and their positions. “SLATE” contains three common letters (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), which should give useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

All letters from the first guess (S, L, A, T, E) are confirmed absent. I need a new 5‑letter word that uses none of those letters. Choosing common letters that haven’t been ruled out will give useful information. “CRONY” (C R O N Y) satisfies this condition.

We know:
- From SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
- From CRONY: N is correct at position 4; C is in the word but not at position 1; R, O, Y are not in the word.

So the secret word has the form _ _ _ N _. The letter C must be somewhere other than the first position (positions 2, 3, or 5). Choosing a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not yet ruled out will give new information.

The word **ICING** matches:
- Pattern I C I N G → N is at position 4.
- C is at position 2 (not position 1, satisfying the “C(-)” clue).
- It introduces only new letters I and G, which have not been eliminated.

Thus ICING is a logical next guess.
