### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:
- L is correct in position 2.
- S is in the word; first S (position 4) is correct, second S (position 5) is present but not at position 5, so another S must be elsewhere (positions 1‑3). Position 1 is ruled out from the first guess, leaving position 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, T, E, B, I.
Thus the word likely has L₂, S₄, and another S at position 3, giving pattern _ L S S _. No common English word fits that exact pattern, so maybe the second S hint only tells us the letter S appears somewhere else (could be the same S counted twice). We look for a common word with L₂ and S₄, avoiding forbidden letters. “FLUSH” (F L U S H) satisfies L₂, S₄, uses only allowed letters, and gives us more information about the remaining positions.

So we guess “FLUSH”.
