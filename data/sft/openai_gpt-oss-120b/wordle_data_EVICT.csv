### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE, we learned:
- S, L, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- T and E are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (positions 4 and 5 respectively).

Therefore, the secret word must contain both T and E, placed somewhere other than those positions, and must avoid using S, L, or A.

I will choose a word that includes T and E in new positions and introduces several fresh letters to gather more information. “TRIED” fits: it has T in position 1 and E in position 4, and it adds the new letters R, I, and D while respecting the known constraints.

From previous feedback:

  - T is not in positions 1 or 4, so possible positions are 2 or 5.
  - E is not in positions 4 or 5, so possible positions are 1 or 2.
To test these possibilities I’ll use a word that places E at position 1 and T at position 5, while also keeping I (to confirm its placement). “EIGHT” fits: E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). This guess avoids all letters known to be absent and checks the two remaining possibilities for E and T.
