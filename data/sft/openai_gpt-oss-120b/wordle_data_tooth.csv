### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, L, M are not in the secret word.
- The secret word has an O in position 3 (✓).
- There is another O in the word but not in position 4 (the second O got a “-” at position 4). Therefore the word contains at least two O’s, with one at position 3 and the other somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that fits the pattern **_ _ O _ _** and includes a second O in a different position (not 4). Choose a word that also introduces new letters to test.

Possible candidates: BOOST (B O O S T) – O at positions 2 & 3, letters B, S, T are still untested and not ruled out.

Thus “BOOST” is a good next guess.

with a T somewhere that is **not** in position 5. The only remaining possible slots for T are positions 1 or 4.

We need a word that fits this pattern, includes a T in a legal position, and introduces new letters (since many have been ruled out).  
A good candidate is **FOOTY**:
- F  O  O  T  Y → O’s are at positions 2‑3, T is at position 4 (allowed), and it adds the fresh letters F and Y for testing.

Therefore the next guess will be FOOTY.

We have determined the word pattern from feedback:

- Positions 2 and 3 are confirmed O (both ✓).
- Position 4 is confirmed T (✓ from FOOTY).
- Position 5 cannot be T (✓ from BOOST gave T‑ at pos5) and Y was x, so not Y.
- Position 1 cannot be any of the letters marked x: C,R,A,N,E,G,L,M,B,S,F,Y, plus also cannot be O (since position1 was F in FOOTY, which was x), so not O.

Thus the pattern is **_ O O T _** with allowed letters for the remaining slots being any not yet ruled out: D, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

A common English word matching **_ O O T _** is **TOOTH** (T O O T H). This uses T in position 1 (allowed), O in 2‑3, T in 4 (already confirmed), and introduces a new letter H in position 5, which we have not tested yet.

Therefore the next guess should be TOOTH.
