### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give useful information about the secret word. “SLATE” is a good opening guess because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (S, L, T). This should help narrow down the possible letters and positions based on the feedback I’ll receive.

We know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is correct).
- Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at any position.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending in E that does not contain those excluded letters, while introducing new letters to test possibilities.

“CRIME” fits:
- Ends with E.
- Contains none of S, L, A, T.
- Introduces C, R, I, M as fresh letters to test.

Thus “CRIME” is a good next guess.

We have:
- Position 5 is confirmed as E.
- Letters C and R are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in guess “CRIME” (C not 1st, R not 2nd).
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, I, M.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending in E, containing C and R in different allowed spots, and preferably introducing fresh letters for more information. “FORCE” fits: it ends with E, places R at position 3 and C at position 4 (both allowed), and adds new letters F and O.

Thus the next guess should be “FORCE”.
