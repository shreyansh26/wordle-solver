### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- A is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word:
- Has **I** as the third letter.
- Contains **R** somewhere other than the second slot.
- Contains **S** somewhere other than the fourth slot.
- Excludes A and E.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **SWIRL** (S 1, W 2, I 3, R 4, L 5). It respects all positional rules and uses none of the forbidden letters.

So I’ll guess “SWIRL”.
