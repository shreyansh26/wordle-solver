### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From prior feedback:
- S is correct in position 1.
- H is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, I, F, T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with S, containing H somewhere other than the second slot, and using only letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). 

A valid candidate is **SMUSH**:
- Starts with S (matches the known correct position).
- Contains H at the fifth position (satisfies “H in word, wrong position”).
- Uses only allowed letters (M, U, S, H) and no excluded letters.

Thus “SMUSH” is a logical next guess.
