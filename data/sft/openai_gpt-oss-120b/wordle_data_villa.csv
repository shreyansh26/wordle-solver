### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells us:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it was the 3rd letter in “CRANE”).

Thus the next guess should include A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E entirely. A good candidate is “BALMY”, which places A in the 2nd position and uses only letters not ruled out.

We have the following feedback:

- From ""BALMY"": B, M, Y are not in the word; L is correct in position 3; A is present but not in position 2 (and still not position 3).

Thus the secret word must have:
- L at the third letter (confirmed).
- A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3 – it can be 1, 4, or 5.
- No letters C, R, N, E, B, M, Y anywhere.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching the pattern _ _ L _ _. Using A at position 1 works and satisfies the constraints, while avoiding the excluded letters. The word **ALLOT** fits:
