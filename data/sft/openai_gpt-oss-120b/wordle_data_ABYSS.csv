### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to provide my first guess for the secret 5‑letter word. A good opening word is one that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it contains two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N). I’ll use that as my initial guess.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but NOT in the third position (since it was marked “-” in CRANE). Therefore our next guess must include A in a different slot (1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E. To maximise information, I’ll choose a word that introduces several new high‑frequency letters while keeping A in a new position. “BALMY” (B‑A‑L‑M‑Y) satisfies these constraints: it contains A in position 2, and adds the fresh letters B, L, M, Y, none of which have been tried yet.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N, E, L, M are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (it was “‑” in CRANE pos 3 and in BALMY pos 2). So A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- B is in the word but not in position 1.
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word containing A, B, Y plus two other letters that haven’t been ruled out. One candidate that satisfies all position constraints is **ABYSS**:
- A at position 1 (allowed)
- B at position 2 (allowed, not position 1)
- Y at position 3 (allowed, not position 5)
- S at positions 4 and 5 (S has not been excluded)

Thus ABYSS fits all known information and introduces the new letter S.
