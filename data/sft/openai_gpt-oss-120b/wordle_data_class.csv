2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have confirmed:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
The fifth letter is still unknown, but we know it is not P, T, H, R, N, E (all marked x). The only common English word fitting the pattern C L A S _ with a new letter not ruled out is ""CLASS"", which places another S in the final position. This will test whether the word ends with a second S.
