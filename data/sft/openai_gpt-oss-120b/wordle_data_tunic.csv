### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains the letters C and N, positioned elsewhere than 1 for C and 4 for N. It does not contain R, A, or E.

A good next guess should include C and N in new positions, and use other letters not yet ruled out. “MUNCH” places N at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed), while avoiding R, A, and E.

Thus I’ll guess:

We know from feedback:
- U is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- C is in the word but not at positions 1 or 4, leaving position 5 as the only possibility.
Thus the word pattern is _ U N _ C.

We need letters for positions 1 and 4 that haven't been ruled out. Common words fitting this pattern include ""TUNIC"" (T U N I C) and ""PUNIC"". ""TUNIC"" is a well‑known word, so we will guess that.
