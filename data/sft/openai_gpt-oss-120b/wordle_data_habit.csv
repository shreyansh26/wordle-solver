### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess that is a common 5‑letter English word. A good starting word uses a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a typical opening guess in these word games.

We know the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. It does contain the letter A, but A is not in the third position (as it was in CRANE). For the next guess we should keep the A in a different spot and try new letters to gather more information while respecting the exclusions. A good candidate is “ALBUM”: A is in position 1 (different from position 3), and the letters L, B, U, M have not been tested yet and are not among the excluded letters.

We have:
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, L, U, M.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from CRANE and ALBUM).
- Letter B is correct at position 3 (✓ from ALBUM).

Thus the pattern is: _ _ B _ _. A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Looking for a common 5‑letter word with B at the third spot and containing A elsewhere, avoiding excluded letters. “HABIT” fits:
- Position 2 = A (allowed),
- Position 3 = B (✓),
- Positions 1,4,5 = H, I, T (none are excluded).

Therefore “HABIT” is a good next guess.
