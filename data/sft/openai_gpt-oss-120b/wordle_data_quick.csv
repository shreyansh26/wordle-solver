### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to get useful information. “CRANE” is frequently used as an opening guess because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and the two most common vowels (A, E). This should give me a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but C is not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. For the next guess we need a valid 5‑letter word that includes C in a different position and avoids the excluded letters. 
“SMOCK” fits these criteria: it contains C in the 4th position, and its other letters (S, M, O, K) have not been ruled out yet. This guess will tell us whether C is in the correct spot and give information about the new letters.

We have determined the secret word ends with ""CK"" (C in position 4, K in position 5). Excluded letters are R, A, N, E, S, M, O. We need a 5‑letter word of the form ___CK using only letters not yet excluded. ""QUICK"" fits: Q, U, I are new letters and the pattern matches ___CK. This will test three new letters and keep the confirmed C and K in place.
