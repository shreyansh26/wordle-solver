### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C, A, N are not in the word (x).
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5).

So the next guess must:
1. Include the letters R and E.
2. Exclude C, A, N.
3. Place R somewhere other than the 2nd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “MOVER” works:
- Contains R (position 5) and E (position 4), both not in the prohibited positions.
- Uses new letters M, O, V which we have no information about yet.
- Contains none of the eliminated letters C, A, N.

Thus “MOVER” is a valid second guess.

Letters ruled out so far are C, A, N, M, V, L, S. The remaining unknown letters are at positions 1 and 3. A common word fitting the pattern and using only letters not yet eliminated is “POWER” (P O W E R). This will test P and W for the first and third positions.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 1: P (✓ from POWER)
- Position 2: O (✓ from multiple guesses)
- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not yet eliminated.
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

Eliminated letters so far: C, A, N, M, V, L, S, W, plus any others that received an “x”. The only unused common letters that could occupy position 3 are, for example, K, T, D, G, H, Y, etc. A common English word fitting “PO?ER” is **POKER** (with K in the third slot). K has not been ruled out, so guessing “POKER” will test that letter.

Thus the next guess should be “POKER”.
