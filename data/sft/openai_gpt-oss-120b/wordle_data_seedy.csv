### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback from first guess SLATE:
- S is correct at position 1.
- L, A, T are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word starts with S, includes an E somewhere in positions 2‑4, and contains none of L, A, T.  
A good candidate that respects these constraints is **SNEER** (S N E E R): it starts with S, places E in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed), and avoids L, A, T.

Current constraints:
- Position 1 = S (confirmed).
- Position 3 = E (confirmed).
- The word contains a second E, but it cannot be in positions 4 or 5; therefore the second E must be at position 2.
- Position 4 ≠ E, L, A, N, R, T.
- Position 5 ≠ E, L, A, N, R, T.
- Letters already excluded from any position: L, A, T, N, R.

Pattern so far: S E E _ _.  
We need to determine letters for positions 4 and 5. Choose a guess that introduces new candidate letters while respecting the pattern, e.g., “SEEDY” (adds D at position 4 and Y at position 5). This will tell us whether D or Y are in the secret word and also verify that position 4 is not E.

Thus the next guess will be **SEEDY**.
