### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, giving useful information for the next steps. “CRANE” is a popular starter word in word‑guessing games because it contains two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should provide a good spread of letters to test.

The feedback tells me that the secret word has an R in the second position, and does not contain C, A, N, or E anywhere. I need a new five‑letter word with R as the second letter and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. “FROST” fits: it places R correctly, and introduces the new letters F, O, S, and T, none of which have been eliminated.

We know the secret word is 5 letters.

Feedback so far:
- From ""CRANE"": C, A, N, E are not in the word; R is correct at position 2.
- From ""FROST"": F and O are not in the word; R is correct at position 2 (consistent); S is correct at position 4; T is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ R _ S _ with T located somewhere other than position 5, i.e., T must be at position 1 or 3.

A common English word that fits this pattern and places T at position 1 is **TRUSS** (T R U S S). This satisfies all constraints:
- R is at position 2.
- S is at position 4.
- T is at position 1 (not position 5).
- No eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, F, O) are used.

Therefore, the next guess should be “TRUSS”.
