### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich word to get information about the letters and their positions. “CRANE” contains three different consonants and two vowels, which should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5). The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. We need a new guess that respects these constraints and tests new letters while keeping E fixed at the end. Choose a common word with E final, such as **SLIDE** (S L I D E). None of the prohibited letters appear, and it introduces several new letters to evaluate.

We have determined the secret word pattern is S L _ _ E based on feedback:
- Position1 S (✓)
- Position2 L (✓)
- Position5 E (✓)
Letters C,R,A,N,I,D are not in the word.

We need a valid English word matching S L _ _ E without using excluded letters. Candidate words:
- SLOPE (O,P are new)
- SLUKE (U,K) less common
- SLURP? ends with P, not E.
- SLEDE? not a word.

""SLOPE"" fits the pattern and uses only new letters, so it's a good next guess.
