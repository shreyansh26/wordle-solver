### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must have:
- R at the second letter.
- An N somewhere other than the fourth position (could be 1, 3, or 5).
- No C, A, or E anywhere.

Choosing a word that fits these constraints and introduces new letters, “BROWN” matches:
- Pattern: B R O W N → R is in the second spot.
- N is at the fifth position (not fourth).
- It contains none of the excluded letters C, A, or E.

Therefore, the next guess will be “BROWN”.

From the feedback:
- The second, third, fourth, and fifth letters are confirmed as R, O, W, N respectively.
- The first letter cannot be B, C, A, E, or any of the eliminated letters, and must form a valid English word.
A common word fitting the pattern _ R O W N with allowed first letters is ""DROWN"".
Thus the next guess should be DROWN.
