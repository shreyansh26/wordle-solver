### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to begin the game with an initial guess that is a common 5‑letter word, allowing a good spread of letters. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter in word‑guessing games because it contains common letters and both a vowel and consonants in varied positions. This should give informative feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word pattern from the feedback on CRANE: position 2 = R, position 3 = A, position 4 = N. Positions 1 and 5 are unknown, but cannot be C or E. Possible words fitting _ R A N _ include BRAND, FRANK, GRAND, PRANK, etc. To differentiate, we choose a guess that introduces new letters in the unknown slots. ""GRAND"" uses G at position 1 and D at position 5, giving clear feedback on both spots while keeping the known R‑A‑N fixed.

We have the pattern:
- Position 2 = R (confirmed)
- Position 3 = A (confirmed)
- Position 4 = N (confirmed)
- Position 1 cannot be C, G, and feedback shows D is in the word but not at position 5, so D must be position 1.
- Position 5 cannot be C, E, G, D, and must complete a real English word.

The only common word fitting D R A N _ is **DRANK** (with K at position 5). This satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter K for testing.
