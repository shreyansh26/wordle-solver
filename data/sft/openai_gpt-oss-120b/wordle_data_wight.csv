### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the pattern of the secret word from previous feedback:
- Positions 2–5 are fixed as I G H T.
- Position 1 is still unknown.
Letters ruled out so far are: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U, L, M.
Possible first letters that fit the pattern “_IGHT” and haven’t been eliminated include F, B, D, P, T, W, etc.
Choosing a word that tests a new plausible first letter while keeping the known correct suffix will give us more information. “FIGHT” tests the letter F in the first position.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the second guess SHOUT, we know:
- S, O, U are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 2.
- T is correct and in position 5.

Thus the secret word has pattern _ _ _ _ T, includes H somewhere in positions 1‑4 (not position 2), and uses none of the excluded letters {C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U}.  

A valid 5‑letter English word fitting these constraints is **LIGHT** (L I G H T): it ends with T, contains H (in position 4, not 2), and avoids all excluded letters.

Letters confirmed not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U, L.

Choosing “MIGHT” lets us test M while keeping the confirmed letters in place.
If the secret is “tight”, the feedback will show M as incorrect, confirming we need to try “tight” next.
