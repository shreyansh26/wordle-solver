### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know the secret word ends with E (✓ at position 5). 
Letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all. 
Letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (the position it had in “CRANE”). 
So the pattern is _ _ _ _ E, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and we must avoid C, R, N. 

To get more information we should try a new common word that ends with E, includes A in a different slot, and introduces fresh letters.  
“PAUSE” fits:  
- Ends with E.  
- A is in position 2 (different from the previous guess).  
- New letters P, U, S are all untested and none are C, R, or N.  

Thus “PAUSE” is a good next guess.

We know the secret word ends with E (position5 = E).  
Letter A is in the word but not in position2 (from PAUSE) nor position3 (from CRANE). So A can be at position1 or position4.  

Letters confirmed absent: C, R, N, P, U, S.  

We need a new word that:
- Ends with E.
- Places A in position1 or 4.
- Avoids the excluded letters.
- Introduces new letters to test.

“AGILE” fits: A in position1, G I L are new letters, and it ends with E. No excluded letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be AGILE.
