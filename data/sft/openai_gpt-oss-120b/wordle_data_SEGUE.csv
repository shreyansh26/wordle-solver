### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that the only correct letter so far is E in the fifth position. All other letters (C, R, A, N) are not in the word at all. Therefore, the secret word ends with …E, and the first four letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C, R, A, N.

We have the following feedback:
- Position 1: S is correct (✓)
- Position 2: E is correct (✓)
- Position 3: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: G is in the word but not in this position (-)
- Position 5: E is correct (✓)

Thus the word pattern is S E _ _ E, with G somewhere other than position 4. The only remaining open positions are 3 and 4; since G cannot be 4, it must be 3. So we have S E G _ E.

We need a valid English word of the form **S E G _ E**. The common word “SEGUE” fits perfectly, using U in the fourth position, a letter not yet excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be “SEGUE”.
