### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a frequent opening guess in word‑guessing games because it tests three of the most common letters (C, R, N) and the two most common vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback to guide the next guesses.

We have feedback:

- Letters C,R,A,N,S,L,I,D,O are excluded.
- From GOUGE:
  * G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 1.
  * O(x) excludes O.
  * U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3.
  * Second G(-) also indicates G is present and not in position 4.
Thus G cannot be in positions 1 or 4; it could be in 2 or 3 (but not both necessarily). U cannot be in position 3; it can be in 1,2, or 4.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in E, using only allowed letters, containing G and U in the permitted spots. “FUGUE” fits:
- Pattern: F (pos1), U (pos2), G (pos3), U (pos4), E (pos5)
- G is not in pos1 or 4, satisfying the G(-) feedback.
- U is not in pos3, satisfying the U(-) feedback.
- All letters (F, U, G, E) are allowed (none are excluded).
