### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. “SLATE” is a good starter: it includes the vowel A and common consonants S, L, T, and E.

We have:
- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: K is correct.
- Position 4: L is correct.
- I is not in the word.
- A, T, E are not in the word.

The duplicate L feedback could mean either the secret contains only one L (at position 4) and the extra L is just marked “present elsewhere”, or the secret contains a second L elsewhere. To keep the search simple, assume the secret has only the one L at position 4. We now need a word of the form S K _ L _ that avoids A, E, I, T and uses only real English words.

A common word that fits this pattern is **SKULK** (S K U L K). It introduces a new vowel U and repeats K at the end, giving us fresh information about the possible fifth‑letter.

Thus the next guess is SKULK.
