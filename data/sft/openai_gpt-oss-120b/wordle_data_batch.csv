### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x), E(x): N and E are not in the word.

So the secret word must contain **C** (somewhere other than the first slot) and **A** (somewhere other than the third slot). It must not contain R, N, or E.

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes both C and A, respects those position constraints, and avoids the forbidden letters.  
Choosing **MACHO**:
- Contains A (position 2, good) and C (position 3, good).
- Uses only new letters M, H, O, none of which are forbidden.
Thus it satisfies all known constraints and gives new information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MACHO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) C(-) H(-) O(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- A is correct at position 2.
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- H is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Letters R, N, E, M, O are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ A _ _ _, containing C and H in allowed spots, and using only new letters besides the forbidden ones.  
The word **PATCH** fits:
- A is at position 2 (correct).
- C is at position 4 (allowed for C).
- H is at position 5 (allowed for H, not position 4).
- New letters P and T are not among the excluded letters.

Thus ""PATCH"" satisfies all current constraints and introduces two fresh letters for more information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the exact letters and positions for four of the five slots:
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: T (correct)
- Position 4: C (correct)
- Position 5: H (correct)

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ A T C H.  
From earlier feedback, the first letter cannot be P, R, N, E, M, or O, and it also cannot be C (C was shown not to be in position 1). Viable letters include B, L, W, H, etc.

Possible English words fitting the pattern are BATCH, LATCH, WATCH, and HATCH. All satisfy the known constraints and have not been excluded.

I'll guess **LATCH**.

We have confirmed: position 2 = A, position 3 = T, position 4 = C, position 5 = H. The only unknown is the first letter. Letters that are known not to be in the word: R, N, E, M, O, P, L, and also C cannot be first (from earlier feedback).
