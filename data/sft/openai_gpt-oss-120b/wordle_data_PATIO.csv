### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next word must contain A in a different slot (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th) and must avoid C, R, N, E. A common word meeting these constraints is **ADULT** (A in position 1, and letters D, U, L, T are all allowed). This will give us new information about the remaining letters.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, N, E not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Guess 2 (ADULT): A not in position 1; D, U, L not in the word; T is in the word but not in position 5.

  * P is correct in position 1 (✓).
  * A is correct in position 2 (✓).
  * S is not in the word (x).
  * T is in the word but not in position 4 (–).
  * The second A gives (–), indicating A appears elsewhere, but we already have A at position 2, so the word likely contains only one A.

From this we know:
- Position 1 = P
- Position 2 = A
- T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 (and from Guess 2 not in position 5 either, but that was based on ADULT where T was in position 5; however Guess 3 shows T is not at 4, so T could be at 3 or 5). 
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, D, U, L, S.
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set (B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any not yet tried).

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **PATIO**:
- P A T I O
- Positions: P (1) fixed, A (2) fixed, T at position 3 (allowed), I and O are unused letters and are not forbidden.
