I need to start the Wordle-style game with a first guess. I’ll pick a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, A, T are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word containing L and E in other positions, avoiding S, A, T. “LEMON” fits: L at position 1, E at position 2, and uses letters M, O, N that we haven’t ruled out yet.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 is E (✓).
- Position 4 is O (✓).
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 5.
- Letters S, A, T, M, N are not in the word.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a valid 5‑letter word that fits the pattern:
_ E _ O _
and includes L at position 3 or 5.

The word “BELOW” fits perfectly:
1 B (allowed)
2 E (✓)
3 L (L’s allowed spot)
4 O (✓)
5 W (allowed, not excluded)

Thus “BELOW” is a good next guess.
