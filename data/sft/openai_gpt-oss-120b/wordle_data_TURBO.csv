### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Given the feedback:
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R (but not as the second letter) and avoids C, A, N, E. Choosing a common word with diverse letters will give us more information. “SPORT” contains R in the fourth position and uses only letters not ruled out (S, P, O, T, R).

We have identified that the secret word contains the letters R, O, and T, each marked as present but in the wrong position from the previous guesses. All other letters tried (C, A, N, E, S, P) are not in the word. Position constraints are:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- T cannot be in position 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses only the known letters is **ROTOR**:
- R in positions 1 and 5 (allowed)
- O in positions 2 and 4 (allowed)

This guess will confirm the placements of R, O, and T or reveal any additional letters.

- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → R must be in position 3.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → O must be in position 1 or 5.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → T can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **TURBO**:
- T is in position 1 (allowed),
- U is a new letter to test,
- R is in position 3 (forced),
- B is a new letter to test,
- O is in position 5 (allowed).
