### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, B, L, S are definitely NOT in the word (x).
- Letters O and T are in the word but currently in wrong spots: O is not position 3, T is not position 4 (as they were placed in BLOTS as O at 3, T at 4).

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Places O and T in different positions than before.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Introduces new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **MOTIF**:
- Positions: M 1, O 2, T 3, I 4, F 5.
- O is now at position 2 (different from the previous position 3).
- T is now at position 3 (different from the previous position 4).
- New letters M, I, F have not been tested yet and are not among the eliminated letters.

Thus this guess will give us fresh information about O, T, and the three new letters.
