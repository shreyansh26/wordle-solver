### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the third position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

So I need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Does not contain C, R, N, or E.
2. Contains the letter A, but not in the third slot.

A good candidate is **GLOAT**:
- It has A in the fourth position, satisfying the “wrong position” rule.
- It contains none of the excluded letters (C, R, N, E).

Thus I will guess “GLOAT”.

We have letters G, L, O, A all present but not in the positions they appeared in the guess GLOAT:
- G not position 1
- L not position 2
- O not position 3
- A not position 4 (and also not position 3 from earlier)

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not position 3.

Thus A cannot be positions 3 or 4, and G, L, O each cannot be their previous spots.

A possible arrangement satisfying all constraints is:
1 = A, 2 = G, 3 = L, 4 = O, 5 = a new letter.

The word “AGLOW” fits this pattern (A‑G‑L‑O‑W) and uses only allowed letters. It obeys all previous feedback, so it is a strong candidate for the secret word.

We will submit “AGLOW”.
