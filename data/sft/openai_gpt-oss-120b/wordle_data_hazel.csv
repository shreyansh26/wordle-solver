### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- L cannot be in position 1.

We need a new guess that respects these constraints while introducing fresh letters to test other possibilities. 

Choosing the word **PLEAD**:
- P (new), L (position 2 – allowed), E (position 3 – allowed), A (position 4 – allowed), D (new).
- No forbidden letters (C, R, N, S, T) are used.
- All known position restrictions are satisfied.

This guess will tell us whether P and D are in the word and will further locate A, E, and L.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from previous feedback:

- The secret word contains the letters **A**, **E**, and **L**.
- Letters **C, R, N, S, T, P, D** are not in the word.
- Position constraints:
  * **L** cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  * **E** cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (so it can only be in position 1 or 4).
  * **A** cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (so it can be in position 1, 2, or 5).

We need a new guess that respects these constraints while also testing new letters.  
A good candidate is **BALMY**:

- **A** is placed in position 2 (allowed).
- **L** is placed in position 3 (allowed).
- Positions 1, 4, and 5 use new letters **B**, **M**, **Y**, none of which have been ruled out yet.
- The word is a valid English word.

This guess will confirm whether **A** and **L** are in those positions and give information about the new letters **B**, **M**, and **Y**.

We have accumulated the following information:

**Confirmed letters and positions**
- **A** is correct at position 2 (from BALMY).

**Letters that are in the word but misplaced**
- **L** is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 3 (from LEAST, PLEAD, BALMY). Hence L can only be at position 4 or 5.
- **E** is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 5 (from CRANE, LEAST, PLEAD). Hence E can only be at position 1 or 4.

**Letters that are not in the word**
C, R, N, S, T, P, D, B, M, Y (all received an “x”).

**Remaining possible letters**
Any letters not yet tried could still be present (e.g., G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, F).

**Constructing the next guess**
We need a word that:
- Has **A** at position 2.
- Places **E** and **L** in the only positions still allowed for them.
- Introduces new letters to test further.

Two viable patterns emerge:
1. **E A _ L _** (E at 1, L at 4)
2. **_ A _ E L** (E at 4, L at 5)

A common English word fitting pattern 2 is **GAVEL**:
- G (new) at 1
- A (✓) at 2
- V (new) at 3
- E (allowed at 4)
- L (allowed at 5)

All constraints are satisfied, and the new letters G and V will give us more information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

We have deduced the following from feedback:

- Position 2 is A (confirmed from BALMY and GAVEL).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed from GAVEL).
- Position 5 is L (confirmed from GAVEL).
- L cannot be in positions 1‑3, so L must be at position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2,3,5, so it must be at position 4 (already set).
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and we already have it at position 2.

Thus the word pattern is **_ A _ E L**.

Letters eliminated so far: C, R, N, S, T, P, D, B, M, Y, G, V, plus any with “x” feedback. Remaining usable letters include H, Z, F, I, O, etc.

A common English word fitting **_ A _ E L** with unused letters is **HAZEL** (H A Z E L). This satisfies all position constraints and uses only letters not ruled out.

- Position 5 is L (confirmed from GAVEL).
- L cannot be in positions 1‑3, so L must be at position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2,3,5, so it must be at position 4 (already set).
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and we already have it at position 2.

Thus the word pattern is **_ A _ E L**.

Letters eliminated so far: C, R, N, S, T, P, D, B, M, Y, G, V, plus any with “x” feedback. Remaining usable letters include H, Z, F, I, O, etc.

A common English word fitting **_ A _ E L** with unused letters is **HAZEL** (H A Z E L). This satisfies all position constraints and uses only letters not ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be HAZEL.",Guess 6: HAZEL -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) Z(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
