### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern as _ _ I N _. From the first guess CRANE, we learned that N is correct in position 4 and letters C, R, A, E are not in the word. From the second guess THINK, we learned that I is correct in position 3, N is confirmed in position 4, and letters T, H, K are also not in the word. 

Thus the remaining unknown letters are in positions 1, 2, and 5, and must be chosen from letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not C, R, A, E, T, H, K). A good candidate word that fits the pattern and introduces new letters is **SLING** (S L I N G), which places S and L in positions 1 and 2 and G in position 5, all of which are still possible.

Therefore, the next guess will be SLING.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)

All other letters tried and marked x are not in the word: C, R, A, E, T, H, K, S, G, P, Y.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ L I N _. We need a valid English word fitting this pattern using only letters not excluded for the first and last positions.

Possible candidates:
- **BLIND** (B L I N D) – B and D have not been ruled out.
- **CLINT** (C excluded)
- **FLINT** (F is possible, but T is excluded)
- **GLINT** (G excluded)
- **SLINT** (S excluded)

Only **BLIND** satisfies the constraints with unused letters B and D. Therefore we should guess BLIND to test those remaining positions.
