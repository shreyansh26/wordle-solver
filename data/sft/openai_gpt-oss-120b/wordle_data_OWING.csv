### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has N in the fourth position, and it does not contain the letters C, R, A, E anywhere. For the next guess we should keep N fixed at position 4 and try new common letters in the other spots, avoiding the eliminated ones. A good candidate is **SLING** (S‑L‑I‑N‑G), which places N correctly at the fourth spot and introduces four fresh letters.

We have confirmed letters I (position 3), N (position 4) and G (position 5) are correct.  
From the fourth guess “GOING” we got:
- G at position 1 marked “-”: the letter G is in the word but not at position 1 → it is at position 5 (already known) and there is no other G.
- O at position 2 marked “-”: O is in the word but not at position 2 → O must be at position 1.
Thus the pattern is **O ? I N G**.  

The only common English word fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **OWING** (O W I N G).  

So the next guess should be:
