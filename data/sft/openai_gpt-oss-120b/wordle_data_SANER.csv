### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE:
  * R is not in position 2
  * A is not in position 3
  * N is not in position 4

We need a new word that includes R, A, N in different positions, avoiding C and E. “RANTS” fits:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed)
- Adds two new letters T and S to test further.

Thus the next guess will be “RANTS”.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE:
  * R is not in position 2
  * A is not in position 3
  * N is not in position 4

We need a new word that includes R, A, N in different positions, avoiding C and E. “RANTS” fits:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed)
- Adds two new letters T and S to test further.

Thus the next guess will be “RANTS”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RANTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(✓) T(x) S(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- A is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at position 1 or 2.
- S is in the word but not at position 5.
- Letters C, E, T are not in the word.

We need a word of the form _ A N _ _ that contains both R and S.  
A valid English word that fits the known letters and lets us test a new letter (D) while keeping R and S in “wrong” positions (so we don’t violate what we already know) is **RANDS** (plural of the South African currency “rand”).  

Pattern: R A N D S  
- A (✓) and N (✓) stay correct.  
- R is at position 1 (known to be wrong, so we’ll get a “-”).  
- S is at position 5 (known to be wrong, so we’ll get a “-”).  
- D is a new letter to test.

This guess respects all current feedback and gives us more information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have established:
- A is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2.
- S is in the word but not at position 5.
- Letters C, E, T, D are not in the word.

A valid pattern is _ A N _ _.  
Choosing a word that fits the known letters, avoids the banned letters, and places S in an allowed spot helps us gather more information, even if it doesn’t include R yet (we’ll locate R on a later guess).  
“PANSY” matches the pattern (P‑A‑N‑S‑Y), uses no forbidden letters, and puts S at position 4 (allowed). This will test new letters P and Y while keeping all known constraints satisfied.

We have determined from the feedback that:
- Position 2 is **A** (✓).
- Position 3 is **N** (✓).
- **S** is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5, so it must be at position 1.
- **R** is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters C, E, T, D, P, Y are ruled out.

Thus the pattern is **S A N _ _**, with R occupying one of the last two spots. The common English word that fits this pattern is **SANER** (S A N E R). Although the earlier guess marked **E** as absent, trying **SANER** will either confirm that **E** is indeed not in the word or reveal the correct final letters.

So the next guess will be “SANER”.
