### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the previous guess SLATE:
- S, L, A are not in the secret word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with E, contains a T somewhere in positions 1‑3, and does not contain S, L, or A. Choose a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to test. “TROVE” fits: T is at position 1 (allowed), and the word ends with E. It also adds R, O, V for further information.

Putting this together:
- Position 1 = T
- Position 2 = H
- Position 5 = E
- R must be somewhere other than positions 2 or 3 → likely position 4.
- There must be a second E that is not at position 4 → likely position 3.
