### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters **P** and **S** are not in the word (x).
- Previously eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, P, S.

- D is not among eliminated letters.
- T appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying “T in the word but wrong position for the earlier guesses”.
- Y is already confirmed at position 5.

We have determined the secret word must fit the pattern _ I T T Y based on the feedback:
- I is correct in position 2.
- T is correct in positions 3 and 4.
- Y is correct in position 5.
- Position 1 is not D, and letters C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, P, S have been eliminated.

The remaining common English word fitting _ I T T Y is ""BITTY"". This uses B, which has not been ruled out. So we guess BITTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 2 is **I** (✓).
- Position 5 is **Y** (✓).
- The letter **T** is in the word but not in position 1 (from TIPSY) and not in position 5 (occupied by Y). So T must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **P** and **S** are not in the word (x).
- Previously eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, P, S.

We need a 5‑letter word matching the pattern `_ I _ _ Y` with a T at either the third or fourth slot.

A common word that satisfies all constraints is **DITTY**:
- D I T T Y fits the pattern.
- D is not among eliminated letters.
- T appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying “T in the word but wrong position for the earlier guesses”.
- Y is already confirmed at position 5.

Thus the next guess should be “DITTY”.
