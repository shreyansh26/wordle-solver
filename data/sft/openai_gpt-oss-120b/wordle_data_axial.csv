### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all. The letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (the position it occupied in CRANE). Therefore, our next guess must:

- Include the letter A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Exclude C, R, N, and E completely.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “BALMY” works:
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses only letters B, L, M, Y besides A, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus we’ll guess “BALMY”.

We have deduced the pattern from feedback:
- Position 1 is A (✓ from ALIAS).
- Position 3 is I (✓).
- Position 4 is A (✓).
- L is in the word but not at position 2 (‑ from ALIAS), and cannot be at 1,3,4, so L must be at position 5.
Thus the word looks like A ? I A L.

We need a common English word fitting A?IAL. The word “AXIAL” fits perfectly:
A X I A L – uses letters not ruled out, satisfies all earlier clues (A not at positions 2 or 3, L not at 2).
