### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make the first guess in the Wordle-like game. A good starting word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it includes the common vowel 'A' and frequent consonants C, R, N, and the letter E. This should give a solid baseline for feedback.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (its position in CRANE). Our next guess should therefore:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E somewhere other than the last slot.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SMELT**:
- Contains E at position 3, satisfying the “E not in position 5” clue.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (S, M, L, T).
- Introduces several common consonants for future clues.
Thus, we will guess SMELT.

Trying placements:

- Put I at position 2 (allowed, since I cannot be 4).
- Choose a remaining first letter that is not excluded.

The pattern becomes: _ I L E T. The word **FILET** satisfies this:
