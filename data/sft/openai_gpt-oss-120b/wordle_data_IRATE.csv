We have confirmed positions: R (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th). Excluded letters: C, N, B, V, G, P, D. Letter T is present but not in position 1, therefore it must be in position 4. This gives the pattern _ R A T E. The only common English word fitting this pattern and using allowed letters is **IRATE** (I R A T E). I has not been ruled out, so we guess IRATE.
