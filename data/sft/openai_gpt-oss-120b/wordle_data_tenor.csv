### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain S, L, or A. It DOES contain T and E, but T is NOT in position 4 and E is NOT in position 5 (their positions in “SLATE”). So the next word must include both T and E in other slots, and avoid S, L, A entirely.

Choosing a word that satisfies these constraints and is a common English word, “CREPT” fits:
- Contains E (position 3) and T (position 5), both not in the forbidden slots.
- Uses only new letters C, R, P that haven’t been ruled out.
- Has no S, L, or A.

Thus “CREPT” is a valid second guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have letters known to be in the word: T, E, R (all in wrong positions from previous guesses). Excluded letters: S, L, A, C, P. Position constraints:
- T cannot be 4th or 5th → possible positions 1‑3.
- E cannot be 3rd or 5th → possible positions 1,2,4.
- R cannot be 2nd → possible positions 1,3,4,5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **ENTRY**:
- E is in position 1 (allowed),
- N is a new letter not excluded,
- T is in position 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5),
- R is in position 4 (allowed, not 2),
- Y is another new letter.

Thus ENTRY respects all known information and introduces two new letters (N, Y) for further clues.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- T, E, R are in the secret word, each in the wrong position in prior guesses.
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, C, P, N, Y.

Position constraints from feedback:
- E cannot be positions 1,3,5 → E must be 2 or 4.
- T cannot be positions 3,4,5 → T must be 1 or 2.
- R cannot be positions 2,4 → R must be 1,3,5.

Since position 3 can only be R (the only letter allowed there) and position 4 can only be E, we set:
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = E

Now we need T in position 1 or 2, and the remaining two letters must be new (not excluded). The word **TIRED** fits perfectly:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (new letter)
- R in position 3 (forced)
- E in position 4 (forced)
- D in position 5 (new letter)

All letters respect previous “x” feedback, and the word is a valid English 5‑letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
