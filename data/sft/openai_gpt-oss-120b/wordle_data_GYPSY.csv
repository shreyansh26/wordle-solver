### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, O, I, L are not in the secret word.
- Letters S and P are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
  * S was guessed at position 1 → S is not position 1.
  * P was guessed at position 2 → P is not position 2.

We need a five‑letter word that includes both S and P, places S somewhere other than the first slot and P somewhere other than the second slot, and avoids the eliminated letters.  

The word **PUSHY** fits:
- Contains P (position 1, allowed) and S (position 3, allowed).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (P, U, S, H, Y).
- Is a valid English word.

Thus the next guess is “PUSHY”.
