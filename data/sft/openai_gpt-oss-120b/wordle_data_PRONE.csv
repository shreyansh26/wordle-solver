We need to start the game with a valid five‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a common word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to give us useful information. ""CRANE"" is a frequent starter in these games because it includes three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should provide a broad set of clues for the next steps.

We know from feedback that:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 4 is N (correct).
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- Letters C and A are not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word has the pattern _ R _ N E, with no C or A anywhere. Common English words that fit include ""PRONE"", ""DRONE"", ""BRINE"" (but B at pos1, I at pos3, note I not ruled out). Any of these could be the answer. I'll guess ""PRONE"" to test the third letter.
