### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes the frequent vowel 'A' and common consonants.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the next word must avoid C,R,N,E and place A somewhere other than the 3rd slot. A common candidate that satisfies these constraints is “SALTY” (A in the 2nd position, no forbidden letters).

From the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, L, T, Y.
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: A (not in positions 2 or 3), S (not in position 1).

Thus the secret word must contain A and S, avoid the excluded letters, with A allowed in positions 1,4,5 and S allowed in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1).

A common English word that meets these constraints is **AMISS**:
- Starts with A (position 1, which is allowed for A).
- Contains S in positions 4 and 5 (valid for S).
- Uses only letters A, M, I, S, S, none of which are excluded.

Therefore, the next guess will be AMISS.
