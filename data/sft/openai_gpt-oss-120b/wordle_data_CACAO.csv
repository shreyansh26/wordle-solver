### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: C _ _ _ _.  
A must appear in position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
We need a valid 5‑letter word starting with C, containing A somewhere other than the third slot, and avoiding R, N, and E.

“CAULK” satisfies all constraints:

- Position 1: C is correct.
- Position 2: A is correct.
- Letters ruled out: R, N, E, U, L, K.

We need a word starting with ""CA"" that does not contain any of the forbidden letters. Choosing a word with three new letters will give the most information. “CAMPY” (C A M P Y) fits: it starts with CA, uses letters M, P, Y that have not been tested, and contains no prohibited letters.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1: **C** is correct.
- Position 2: **A** is correct.
- Letters **R, N, E, U, L, K, M, P, Y** are not in the word.

So the secret word is of the form **C A _ _ _**, and the remaining unknown letters must come from the set {B, D, F, G, H, I, J, O, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z}.  

A good next guess should keep the known correct letters (C A) and introduce three new letters from the allowed set.  
The word **CATCH** fits these criteria:
- Starts with “CA”.
- Introduces the new letters **T** and **H** (and repeats **C**, which can tell us if C appears elsewhere).
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess will be “CATCH”.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1 C is correct.
- Position 2 A is correct.
- Letters R, N, E, U, L, K, M, P, Y, T, H are not in the word.
- The C at position 4 got a dash, meaning C is in the secret word but not at position 4. Since we already have a C at position 1, this indicates there is at least a second C somewhere else (positions 3 or 5).

Thus the pattern is C A _ _ _, with another C in either position 3 or 5, and the remaining letters must come from the set of letters not yet eliminated (B, D, F, G, I, J, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Z).

A common word that fits all constraints is **CACAO**:
- Starts with CA.
- Has a second C at position 3.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (A repeats, O is still possible).

So the next guess will be “CACAO”.
