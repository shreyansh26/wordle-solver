### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both vowels and consonants.

We know from feedback that letters C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H are not in the word. T is correct and in position 5. The secret word therefore ends with T and must be composed of the remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others not yet eliminated). We need a valid English word of length 5 ending in T using only allowed letters. “SPOUT” fits: S, P, O, U are all still possible, and it ends with T.

- Letters S and P are not in the word (x).
- Earlier excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H.
