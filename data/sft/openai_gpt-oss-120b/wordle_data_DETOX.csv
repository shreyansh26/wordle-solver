### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or N. The only confirmed letter is E, but it is NOT in the 5th position (since in ""CRANE"" E was at position 5 and got a ""-""). Therefore the next guess should:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 2 (LEVEL): L and V are not in the word. The E in position 2 is correct (✓). The second E (position 4) is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Thus:
- Position 2 = **E** (confirmed).
- The word contains at least one more **E** that is not in position 4, and also not in position 2 (already taken). So the extra E can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, L, V.

We need a 5‑letter word with E at position 2 and another E elsewhere, using only letters not ruled out. A good candidate is **SEEDS** (S E E D S), which satisfies:
- E at position 2 (✓)
- Another E at position 3 (fulfills the extra‑E requirement)
- Uses only letters S and D, which have not been eliminated.

Therefore the next guess should be SEEDS.

We have confirmed:

- Letters C, R, A, N, L, V, S, D, I are not in the word (all got x).
- The letter E appears elsewhere in guesses, giving '-' marks, which only tells us E exists (already known) but not its other positions; no extra constraints on other positions.

Thus we need a 5‑letter word with E at the second slot, using only allowed letters (B, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.) and avoiding the excluded ones.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
