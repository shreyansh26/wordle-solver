### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess “CRANE” tells us:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word (marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked -).

Therefore the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N and place E somewhere other than the last slot. A good candidate is “BLEST”, which includes E at the 3rd position and uses other common letters.

We have the following information:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, B, T.
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from CRANE and BLEST). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letter S is in the word but not in position 4.
We need a guess that includes E, L, and S in allowed spots and introduces new letters to test further possibilities.  

One possible arrangement that respects all constraints is:
- Position 1: S (S not allowed in 4, so 1 is fine)
- Position 2: E (E not allowed in 3 or 5, so 2 is fine)
- Position 3: L (L not allowed in 2, so 3 is fine)
- Position 4: L (still allowed)
- Position 5: S (S not allowed in 4, so 5 is fine)

The word “SELLS” satisfies these placements and is a valid English word.
