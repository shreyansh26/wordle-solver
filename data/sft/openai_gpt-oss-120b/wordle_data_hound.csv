### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N _, with O somewhere in positions 1,2, or 5 (but not 3). All letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, Y are excluded.

We need a common 5‑letter word matching these constraints. Checking possibilities, “MOUND” fits:

We have determined the secret word pattern is **_ O U N D**.

From previous guesses we have eliminated the following letters for the first position:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, Y, M, B, P.

The only common English words that fit the pattern and use a first letter not yet eliminated are:
- FOUND
- HOUND
- WOUND

Since we have only one guess left (the 6th attempt), we must choose one of these. All three are plausible, but “FOUND” is a very common word and often appears in word‑guessing games, so it is a reasonable final guess.

Thus I will guess **FOUND**.
