### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes the vowel A and the common consonants C, R, N, and E, which will give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the secret must contain A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, R, N, E entirely.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes A (not in position 3) and does not use any of the forbidden letters. “ADULT” fits these constraints:
- Contains A in position 1.
- Uses D, U, L, T, none of which have been ruled out.
Therefore ADULT is a logical next guess.

We have:
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, D, U, T.
- Known letters: A is in the word but not in positions 1 (from ADULT) nor 3 (from CRANE). So A can be in position 2 or 5.
- L is confirmed at position 4 (from ADULT).

Thus the secret word fits one of these patterns:
1. _ A _ L _
2. _ _ _ L A (but A cannot be position 3, so only position 5 works here).

We need a valid English word using only allowed letters (excluding the forbidden set) that matches either pattern.

A good candidate is **GAILY**:
- Pattern: G A I L Y → matches _ A _ L _
- Contains A at position 2 and L at position 4.
- Uses letters G, I, Y which are not excluded.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess is GAILY.
