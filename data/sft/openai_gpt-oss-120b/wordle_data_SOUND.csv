### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word fits the pattern _ O U N D with letters in positions 2‑5 confirmed (O‑U‑N‑D).  
Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, M, T, F, B, and also the first‑letter candidates that have been tried (B, F, M, etc.).  
Possible valid English words ending in “OUND” that have not been eliminated are:
- HOUND
- POUND

All four satisfy the pattern and use first letters (H, P, S, W) that are still possible. I’ll choose **HOUND** to test the letter H.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Letters that are not in the word (all positions): C, R, A, E, M, T.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ O U N _.

We need a valid English word matching that pattern, using only letters not ruled out. “FOUND” (F‑O‑U‑N‑D) satisfies the pattern and introduces two new letters, F and D, which have not been eliminated. It also respects all previous exclusions.

Therefore the next guess should be FOUND.

Letters known not to be in the word: C, R, A, E, M, T, F (all marked x).  
We need a valid English word that fits _OUND and does not use any excluded letters for the first position.

Possible candidates: BOUND, HOUND, POUND, SOUND, WOUND.
