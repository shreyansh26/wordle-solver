### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE, the letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word, while N is in the word but not in the fourth position. I need a new guess that includes N in a different spot (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5) and avoids the eliminated letters.

We have the following feedback so far:

- CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → N is in the word but not in position 4; C,R,A,E are not in the word.
- UNZIP: U(-), N(✓), Z(x), I(-), P(-) → N is correct at position 2. U, I, and P are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (U not 1st, I not 4th, P not 5th). Z is not in the word.
- KNOLL: K(x), N(✓), O(x), L(x), L(x) → K, O, L are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is **_ N _ _ _** with the letters **U, I, P** somewhere (but not in the disallowed spots) and all other excluded letters ruled out.

Constraints:
- Position 1 cannot be U.
- Position 4 cannot be I.
- Position 5 cannot be P.
- All other positions are free of the excluded letters.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses the required letters is **INPUT**:
- I (position 1) – allowed (I just needs to avoid position 4).
- N (position 2) – already confirmed.
- P (position 3) – allowed (P just avoids position 5).
- U (position 4) – allowed (U just avoids position 1).
- T (position 5) – a new, allowed letter.

Thus INPUT is a valid next guess.
