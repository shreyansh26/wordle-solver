### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has R in the second position and does NOT contain C, A, N, or E anywhere. We need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints and explores new letters. “BROTH” fits: it has R as the second letter, and introduces B, O, T, H while avoiding the prohibited letters.

We have:
- R is confirmed at position 2.
- Letters C, A, N, E, B, O, H are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not at position 4 (from BROTH). So T can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
