### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to gather information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it uses the frequent letters C, R, N and the two vowels A and E, which will help identify presence and positions of both consonants and vowels in the secret word.

We know from the feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the secret word has the form _ _ _ N E, with R somewhere other than position 2, i.e., position 1 or 3. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters is **BORNE** (B O R N E): R is in position 3, N and E are correctly placed, and it avoids C and A.
