### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5 and got a “-”).

So the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N entirely and include E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

We have two guesses so far:

2. SPEED → S, P, D are not in the word (x). Both E’s are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (-).

Thus:
- The secret word contains at least one E.
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5. So E must be in position 1 or 2 (or both if the word has two E’s).
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, P, D are excluded entirely.

We need a common 5‑letter word that:
- Contains E at position 1 or 2 (preferably position 1 to keep options open).
- Uses none of the excluded letters.
- Has no other E’s in positions 3‑5.

The word **EIGHT** satisfies all conditions:
- E is at position 1.
- Remaining letters I, G, H, T are not among the excluded set.
- No extra E’s appear in positions 3‑5.

So we will guess “EIGHT”.

- E is at position 1.
- Remaining letters I, G, H, T are not among the excluded set.
- No extra E’s appear in positions 3‑5.

So we will guess “EIGHT”.

- Excluded letters (x): C, R, A, N, S, P, D, I, G, H.
- E is confirmed in the word, not in positions 1,3,4,5 → must be position 2.
- T is in the word, not in position 5 (feedback from guess 3). Position 5 cannot be T.
- Remaining unknown positions 1,3,4 must be filled with letters that are not excluded.

We need a common 5‑letter word of the form _ E _ _ _, containing T somewhere other than position 5, and using none of the excluded letters.  
“MELTY” (M E L T Y) fits:
- E is at position 2.
- T is at position 4 (not position 5).
- Letters M, L, Y have not been ruled out.
Thus it will test T’s placement and introduce three new letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = E (from MELTY ✔)
- Position 4 = T (from MELTY ✔)
- Position 5 = Y (from MELTY ✔)
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from MELTY -). Since positions 2,4,5 are already occupied, L must be at position 1.
Thus the pattern is **L E _ T Y**.

Letter F fits the remaining spot and hasn’t been ruled out, forming the common word **LEFTY**.

We will guess that.
