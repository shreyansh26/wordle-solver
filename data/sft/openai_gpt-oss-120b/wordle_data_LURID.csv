### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain T, A, C, or E. The letter R is present but is not in the second position (the position it occupied in ""TRACE""). Therefore, our next guess must include R in a different position and avoid the letters T, A, C, and E. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters is “ROBIN” (R in position 1, and O, B, I, N are all unused so far). This will let us test several new letters while keeping the required R.

We have determined:
- The secret word does NOT contain T, A, C, E, O, B, N.
- The letter I is correct in position 4.
- The letter R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4, so it must be in position 3 or 5.

A good next guess should keep I in position 4, place R in one of its possible positions, and introduce new letters while avoiding the known‑absent ones as much as possible. The word **APRIL** fits the pattern (R at position 3, I at 4) and adds the new letters P and L for testing, even though it repeats the known‑absent A (which will simply be marked as not present again). This will give us extra information about P and L.

Thus the next guess is:
