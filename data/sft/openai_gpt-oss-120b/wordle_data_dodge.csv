### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed letters from feedback:
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: D (✓)
- Position 4: G (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the word pattern is _ O D G E.

Eliminated letters (marked x) are: C, R, A, N, S, H, V, L, U, P, W.  

The only unknown letter is the first position, which must be a letter not in the eliminated set. A common English word fitting the pattern is **BODGE** (B O D G E). The letter B has not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “BODGE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

So far the secret word ends with **E**, contains an **O** somewhere other than the third slot, and does not contain any of the letters C,R,A,N,S,H,V.

We need a new guess that:
1. Keeps **E** in the fifth position.
2. Places **O** in a different position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **LOUPE**:
- Position 1 = L (still possible)
- Position 2 = O (puts O in a non‑third slot)
- Position 3 = U (new letter)
- Position 4 = P (new letter)
- Position 5 = E (confirmed)

All letters are allowed, and the placement of O satisfies the “‑” feedback from the previous guess.
