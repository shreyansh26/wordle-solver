### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or N. It DOES contain A and E, but A is NOT in position 3 and E is NOT in position 5. We need a new five‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, N, and uses common letters to gain more information. 
The word “ADEPT” satisfies:
- Contains A (position 1, not the prohibited position 3)
- Contains E (position 3, not the prohibited position 5)
- No C, R, or N.
Thus “ADEPT” is a good next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- E must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot after it was ruled out from positions 1,3,4,5).
- A cannot be in positions 1‑3, so it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, D, P, T, V, S.
We need a word fitting the pattern:
1 ? 2 E 3 ? 4 ? 5 ?   with A at position 4 or 5.
Choosing A at position 5 gives pattern _ E _ _ A.
A valid English word that uses only allowed letters is **FELLA** (F E L L A).
All its letters (F, L, A, E) are not among the excluded ones, and it satisfies the positional constraints.
Thus we guess FELLA.

We have deduced:
- E is confirmed at position 2.
- A is confirmed to be in the word but not at positions 1,2,3,5 → must be position 4.
- L is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4. Two L’s gave yellow marks, indicating the word likely contains two L’s, so they must occupy positions 1 and 5.
- All other letters (C,R,N,D,P,T,V,S,F) are excluded.

Thus the pattern is L E _ A L. The only common English word that fits is **LEGAL** (with G in the third slot, a letter not yet ruled out).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
