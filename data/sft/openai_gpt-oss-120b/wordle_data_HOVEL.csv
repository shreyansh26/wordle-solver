### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

2. HEIST → H(✓) E(-) I(x) S(x) T(x)

3. HOLED → H(✓) O(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   → H at 1, O at 2, E at 4 are correct. L is in the word but not at position 3. D is not in the word.

From this we deduce:
- Fixed letters: H _ _ _ _, with H at 1, O at 2, E at 4.
- L must be somewhere other than position 3; positions 1, 2, 4 are already taken, so L must be at position 5.
- The remaining unknown letter is at position 3 and cannot be any of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, I, S, T, D) nor can it be H, O, E, L (duplicate unlikely). Viable candidates include V, B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word that fits the pattern H O _ E L is **HOVEL** (a small, squalid dwelling). The third letter V is not excluded, so this guess satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter.

Thus the next guess should be HOVEL.
