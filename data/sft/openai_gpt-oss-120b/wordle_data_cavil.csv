### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and both a vowel and a frequently used vowel‑consonant pair (A, E). This will give a good spread of letters for the first round of feedback.

From the first guess:
- C is correct and in the right spot (position 1).
- R, N, and E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret pattern is: C _ _ _ _.  
A must appear in one of the remaining positions (2, 4, or 5).

I need a second guess that keeps C in the first position, includes A in a new position (try position 2), and introduces new letters to test. “CATCH” satisfies these conditions: C at position 1, A at position 2, and new letters T, C (duplicate) and H to gather more info.

We have the following feedback:

1. Guess CRANE → C is correct in position 1, R, N, E are not in the word, A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. Guess CATCH → C in position 1 is still correct, A in position 2 is now correct, T, H are not in the word, and the second C (position 4) is in the word but in a different spot. This suggests either the secret contains a second C somewhere else, or the game’s duplicate‑letter handling treats it as “present elsewhere”.

So far the confirmed pattern is:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A
- Positions 3‑5: unknown, but we need to test new letters while keeping the CA start.

Letters known to be absent: R, N, E, T, H.  
Letters we have not yet tested (and are still possible): B, D, I, L, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep C at position 1 and A at position 2.
- Introduce three new letters to gather more information.
- Optionally include a second C to verify whether the secret really has two C’s.

The word **CAVIL** fits these criteria:
- Starts with CA.
- Uses three fresh letters V, I, L that have not been ruled out.
- Does not reuse any letters already known to be wrong.

Thus we will guess “CAVIL”.
