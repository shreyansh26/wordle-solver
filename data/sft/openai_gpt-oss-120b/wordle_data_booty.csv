### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters and a variety of vowels and consonants to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is correct in the 4th position.
- S, L, A, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like _ _ _ T _. I need a new 5‑letter word that has T in the 4th slot and avoids S, L, A, E. A good candidate is “RIFTY” (R I F T Y), which satisfies all constraints.

We have confirmed letters:
- T is correct in position 4 (from SLATE and RIFTY).
- Y is correct in position 5 (from RIFTY).

Feedback from PUTTY shows:
- P and U are not in the word.
- The T in position 3 is present but not in that position (marked “-”), which is consistent with the word having a T at position 4 (the correct one) and no additional constraint that there must be another T. So the only confirmed pattern is ___TY.

Excluded letters so far: S, L, A, E, R, I, F, P, U.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in “TY” with T in the fourth slot and containing none of the excluded letters. “BOOTY” fits:
- B, O are not excluded.
- Pattern B O O T Y matches ___TY.
- No prohibited letters are used.

Thus the next logical guess is BOOTY.
