### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have no prior information about the secret word, so we need a common, information‑rich starting word. ""CRANE"" contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and a mix of consonants and a vowel, which should give us useful feedback for the next steps.

We know from the previous feedback that the letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (the position it occupied in ""CRANE""). Therefore the next guess must include R in a different slot and avoid C, A, N, and E altogether. 

Choosing common letters that haven't been tested yet and placing R away from position 2, ""BURST"" fits these constraints:
- Contains R at position 3.
- Uses only new letters B, U, S, T besides R.
- No prohibited letters appear.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letter T is correct in position 5.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letter S is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word ends with **T**, contains **R** and **S** in the first four positions, with R allowed in positions 1 or 4, and S allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **SHIRT**:
- S (position 1) – allowed.
- H (position 2) – new letter.
- I (position 3) – new letter.
- R (position 4) – R not in 2 or 3, so position 4 is fine.
- T (position 5) – confirmed correct.

All letters are permissible (none of the excluded letters appear). Therefore, “SHIRT” is a strong next guess.
