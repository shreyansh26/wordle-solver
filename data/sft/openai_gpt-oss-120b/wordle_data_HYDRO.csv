### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels, so I can get a good spread of information from the feedback. Words like “SLATE”, “CRANE”, or “AUDIO” are popular opening guesses. I’ll choose **SLATE** because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), which should give useful clues about both letters and positions.

Thus the secret word contains the letters **O**, **D**, and **R** (O appears at least once, possibly twice). None of the letters S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, P are allowed.

To gather more information we need a guess that:
1. Uses only allowed letters.
2. Includes O, D, and R in new positions.
3. Introduces a few new letters to test them.

The word **CHORD** meets these criteria:
- All its letters (C, H, O, R, D) are currently allowed.
- It places O in position 3 (we know O is not in positions 2, 3, 4, so this should return a “‑” if O is indeed in the word, confirming O’s presence and its wrong‑position status).
- It places D in position 5 (we know D is not in position 5, so this should return an “x”, confirming that restriction).
- It places R in position 4 (R is not in position 2, so position 4 is still possible; the feedback will tell us if it’s correct or just present elsewhere).
- It adds the new letters C and H, giving us information about two more possible letters.

Thus “CHORD” is a strategic next guess.

Words like “SLATE”, “CRANE”, or “AUDIO” are popular opening guesses. I’ll choose **SLATE** because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), which should give useful clues about both letters and positions.

Choosing a word with common letters and a mix of consonants and vowels will give the most information. “MOUND” uses M, O, U, N, D – none of which appeared in the previous guess – so it’s a valid next attempt.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (SLATE): all letters S, L, A, T, E are not in the secret word.
- Guess 2 (MOUND): M, U, N are not in the word; O and D are in the word but in different positions (O not in position 2, D not in position 5).

So the secret word must contain the letters **O** and **D**, placed elsewhere than those positions, and cannot contain any of the letters S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N.  

Remaining possible letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter English word using O and D (and three other allowed letters) that respects the position constraints.  
The word **DROOP** fits:
- Contains D (position 1) and O (position 3), satisfying the “wrong position” clues.
- Uses only allowed letters (D, R, O, O, P).
- No excluded letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be “DROOP”.

Guess 3: DROOP -> FEEDBACK: D(-) R(-) O(-) O(-) P(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback so far:
- SLATE: all letters S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
- MOUND: M, U, N are not in the word; O and D are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (O not in position 2, D not in position 5).
- DROOP: P is not in the word; D, R, and O are in the word but not in the positions they appear here (so O is not in positions 3 or 4; D is not in position 1; R is not in position 2).  
Thus the secret word contains the letters **O**, **D**, and **R** (O appears at least once, possibly twice). None of the letters S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, P are allowed.

To gather more information we need a guess that:
1. Uses only allowed letters.
2. Includes O, D, and R in new positions.
3. Introduces a few new letters to test them.

The word **CHORD** meets these criteria:
- All its letters (C, H, O, R, D) are currently allowed.
- It places O in position 3 (we know O is not in positions 2, 3, 4, so this should return a “‑” if O is indeed in the word, confirming O’s presence and its wrong‑position status).
- It places D in position 5 (we know D is not in position 5, so this should return an “x”, confirming that restriction).
- It places R in position 4 (R is not in position 2, so position 4 is still possible; the feedback will tell us if it’s correct or just present elsewhere).
- It adds the new letters C and H, giving us information about two more possible letters.

Thus “CHORD” is a strategic next guess.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, P, C.
- Letters in the word: O, D, R, H.
- R is correctly placed at position 4.
- O is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 → possible positions 1 or 5.
- D is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → possible positions 2 or 3.
- H is in the word but cannot be in position 2 → possible positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Remaining positions can be filled with any allowed letters (e.g., Y, F, G, I, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, B).

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **HYDRO**:
- H Y D R O
- H at 1 (allowed), Y at 2 (new test letter), D at 3 (allowed), R at 4 (confirmed), O at 5 (allowed).

Thus the next guess should be **HYDRO**.
