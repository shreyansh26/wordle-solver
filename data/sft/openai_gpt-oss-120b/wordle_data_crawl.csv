### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, T, and E are not in the word.
- A is correct in the 3rd position.
- L is in the word but not in the 2nd position.

Thus the secret word looks like _ _ A _ _. L must appear somewhere other than position 2. For the next guess I’ll keep A in the 3rd slot and try a word that introduces new letters while respecting the known constraints. “QUARK” fits the pattern (Q U A R K), contains no forbidden letters (S, T, E), and keeps A at position 3. It also tests four new letters (Q, U, R, K) to gather more information.
