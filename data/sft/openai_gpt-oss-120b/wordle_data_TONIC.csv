### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in the positions they were guessed in (C was guessed at position 1, so it cannot be at position 1; N was guessed at position 4, so it cannot be at position 4). The letters R, A, and E are not in the word at all. Choose a new five‑letter word that includes C and N in allowed positions and avoids R, A, E. “LINCH” fits: it contains N at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed), and uses only other letters that haven’t been ruled out.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- N is in the word, not in position 4, and is confirmed to be correct at position 3 (✓).
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters R, A, E, L, H are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ N _ _.  
We must place C (cannot be 1 or 4) → possible positions 2 or 5.  
I cannot be in position 2 and also cannot be in position 3 (occupied by N) → possible positions 1,4,5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **TONIC**:
- N is third (✓),
- I is fourth (I is in the word, not position 2),
- C is fifth (C is in the word, not positions 1 or 4),
- No excluded letters are used.

So the next guess is TONIC.
