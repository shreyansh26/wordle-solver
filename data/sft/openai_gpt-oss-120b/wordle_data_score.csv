### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 5 is definitely **E**.
- Letters **C**, **R**, and **O** are all in the word.
- **C** cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → it must be in position 2 or 3.
- **R** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → it must be in position 1 or 4.
- **O** cannot be in position 2 → it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters **A**, **N**, **F** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with **E** that contains C, R, O in allowed spots.  
The word **OCHRE** fits perfectly:

- O is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2).  
- C is in position 2 (allowed, not 1 or 4).  
- H is a new filler letter.  
- R is in position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3).  
- E is in position 5 (confirmed).

Thus OCHRE satisfies all known constraints and introduces a new letter **H** to test further.
