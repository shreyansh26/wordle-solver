### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with any valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give useful feedback. “TRACE” contains three frequent consonants (T, R, C) and two vowels (A, E), which should provide a solid start.

We know:
- The secret word ends with E (E is correct in position 5).
- T is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in positions 2‑4.
- A is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- R and C are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E that includes both A and T in new spots and avoids R and C. “LATHE” fits:
- L A T H E → contains A (position 2) and T (position 3), both different from their previous spots.
- Ends with E, and introduces new letters L and H for further clues.

Thus the next guess is LATHE.

We have determined the following constraints from the feedback:
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- Position 2 is A (correct).
- T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3, leaving position 4 as the only viable spot → T at position 4.
- H is in the word but not in position 4; it can be position 1 or 3.
- Letters R, C, L are not in the word.

The pattern is _ A _ T E, with H at position 1 or 3. The only common English word fitting this pattern with H at position 1 is **HASTE** (H A S T E). This satisfies all known constraints and introduces a new letter S for additional information.

Therefore, the next guess should be HASTE.
