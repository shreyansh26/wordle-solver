We have letters confirmed to be in the secret word: R, E, I.
Positions they cannot occupy:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from MERIT) → possible positions: 1,4,5.
- E cannot be in positions 5 (from CRANE) or 2 (from MERIT) → possible positions: 1,3,4.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from MERIT) → possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

We must avoid letters known not to be in the word: C, A, N, M, T.

Choose a word that places R, E, I in allowed spots and adds two new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
The word **RILED** fits:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- New letters L and D have not been excluded.

Thus “RILED” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C (x), R (-), A (x), N (x), E (-) → R and E are in the word but not in those positions.
- From MERIT: M (x), E (-), R (-), I (-), T (x) → E, R, I are in the word but not in those positions.
- From RILED: R (-), I (-), L (✓), E (✓), D (-) → L is correct at position 3, E is correct at position 4. R, I, D are in the word but not in the positions shown.

Thus L = pos3, E = pos4.  
R cannot be positions 1,2,3 → only possible is pos5.  
I cannot be positions 2,4 → only possible is pos1.  
D cannot be position5 (from RILED) → the remaining open slot is position2.

Therefore the word must be I D L E R.

We will guess “IDLER”.
