### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has:
- C in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)

Letters ruled out entirely: R, N, S, T, B, L, D, G.

Thus the word pattern is C A _ _ E, with the middle two letters drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding the ruled‑out letters). A plausible common word that fits is **CAFFE** (C A F F E), using F, which has not been eliminated. This satisfies all known constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a word of the form C _ _ _ E with an A in position 2 or 4, and no R or N. “CASTE” fits: C A S T E (A at position 2, no R/N, and ends with E). This will test A’s placement and introduce new letters S and T.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from previous feedback:
- Position 1: C is correct.
- Position 2: A is correct.
- Positions 3 and 4 are unknown letters, but they cannot be S, T, R, N (all marked x).
- Position 5: E is correct.

So the secret word has the form C A _ _ E, with the middle two letters being any that are not S, T, R, N and not C, A, E already used.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **CABLE** (C A B L E). B and L have not been ruled out, and the word satisfies all known constraints.

Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, N, S, T, B, L.

Thus the secret word has the form **C A _ _ E**, with the two middle letters drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding the prohibited letters and the already‑used C, A, E unless they appear twice).

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **CADGE** (C A D G E). The letters D and G have not been ruled out, and the word satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess should be CADGE.
