### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to gather information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a frequent opening guess in these games because it covers two consonants (C, R) and two vowels (A, E) plus an additional consonant (N). This should give me good feedback on which letters are present and their positions.

The feedback indicates that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids all those letters. Choosing a word with common, varied letters will give the most information. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, and T, none of which have been ruled out, so it’s a good next guess.

We have the following information:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From guess 2 (MIGHT): M, G, H, T are not in the word; I is in the word but not in position 2.
- From guess 3 (SPOIL):  
  - S is correct at position 1.  
  - P is correct at position 2.  
  - O is not in the word.  
  - I is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - L is correct at position 5.

Thus the pattern is **S P ? ? L**, with I somewhere in the remaining unknown spots (positions 3 or 4). Since I cannot be at position 4, it must be at position 3. Therefore the word must be **S P I ? L**.

We need a common English word fitting “SPI?L”. The only viable word that uses only allowed letters is **SPILL** (the extra L at position 4 is permissible because L is already known to be in the word).
