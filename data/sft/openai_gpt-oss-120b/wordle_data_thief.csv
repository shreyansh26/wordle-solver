### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word, while E is present but not in the fifth position (since CRANE has E at position 5). I need a new guess that:
- Excludes C, R, A, N.
- Includes E in a different position to test where it belongs.
A good candidate is “SHELF”, which contains E at the third position and avoids the excluded letters.

From the feedback:
- Positions: H is correct at position 2, F is correct at position 5.
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (from CRANE) nor at position 3 (from SHELF). So E can be at position 1 or 4.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, S, L.
We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ H _ _ F that includes E at position 4 (since position 1 would conflict with many possibilities). The word “THIEF” fits all constraints: T (unknown), H (✓), I (unknown), E (‑ now at position 4), F (✓). It also introduces new letters T and I for further testing.
