### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is correct and in the right position (third letter).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position, so N cannot be fourth; it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a new five‑letter word with A third, containing N (not fourth), and avoiding C, R, E.  
A good candidate is **PLAIN**:
- Pattern: P L A I N → A is third, N is fifth (allowed), and it uses none of the excluded letters.
Thus we will guess PLAIN.

We have the following information:

- Position 3 is definitely **A** (from both guesses).
- Letter **N** is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (it was wrong in position 4 of “CRANE” and wrong in position 5 of “PLAIN”). Thus N can only be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters that are known NOT to be in the word: C, R, E, P, L, I.

We need a 5‑letter word with A third, containing N in position 1 or 2, and avoiding the excluded letters.

A good candidate is **GNASH**:
- Pattern: G N A S H
- A is third, N is second (allowed), and none of the letters G, S, H are excluded.

This will test the remaining possibilities and keep all known constraints.
