### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters to give useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes a mix of consonants and a vowel and is frequently used in such games.

The feedback tells us the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. It does not contain C, A, N, or E. I need a new guess that includes R in a different position and introduces several new letters to gather more information. Choosing a common word with R at the start and new letters like U, S, T, Y will help test many possibilities while respecting the exclusions.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N, E are not in the word; R is present but not in position 2.
- From RUSTY: U, S are not in the word; T is correct at position 4; Y is correct at position 5; R is present but not in positions 1 or 2.

Thus R must be in position 3 (since positions 1,2,5 are taken or impossible). The known pattern is _ _ R T Y.

We need a common 5‑letter word matching that pattern, using letters not eliminated. ""FORTY"" fits: F (allowed), O (allowed), R (position 3), T (position 4), Y (position 5). No excluded letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be ""FORTY"".
