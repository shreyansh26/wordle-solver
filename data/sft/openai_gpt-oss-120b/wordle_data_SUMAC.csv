### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 1 is fixed as **S** (✓).
- The secret word contains the letters **C**, **A**, and **U**, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in the guesses:
  * C is not in position 2.
  * A is not in positions 3 or 5, so A can be in position 2 or 4.
  * U is not in positions 3 or 4, so U can be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters **R, N, E, B, P** are not in the word.

We need a real English 5‑letter word that starts with **S**, includes **C**, **A**, **U** in the allowed positions, and avoids the banned letters.

One valid word that satisfies all these constraints is **“SUCKA”** (slang spelling of “sucker”).  
- Positions: S (1), U (2), C (3), K (4), A (5).  
- C is not in position 2 (it’s in position 3).  
- A is not in positions 3 or 5 in the earlier guesses, but here A is in position 5 — this violates the earlier “A not in position 5” rule, so “SUCKA” is invalid.

We must find a word where A is in position 2 or 4 and U is in position 2 or 5, with C in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). The only common English word meeting these constraints is **“SCUBA”**, which we have already tried and discovered B is not in the secret word.

Given the limited set of English words that contain S, C, A, U, the remaining possibility is **“SCAUL”**, which is a variant spelling of “scaul” (a dialect word meaning “to scoop”).  
- Positions: S (1), C (2) – but C cannot be in position 2, so “SCAUL” does not work.

At this point the only remaining standard word that fits the pattern **S ? ? ? U** with C and A elsewhere is **“SACRU”** (a rare proper noun, not allowed). 

Since no common English word fits all constraints, we need to test a new arrangement by moving the letters while still respecting the known constraints.  
Let’s try placing A in position 2, U in position 5, and C in position 4, filling the remaining slot with a new letter **L** (which has not been ruled out).

This gives the word **“SALCU”**, which is not a standard English word.

Instead, we can try **“SAUCL”** (reordering to form “SAUCL”), but again this isn’t a valid word.

Given the difficulty, we should choose a plausible English word that includes the required letters and introduces a new test letter, even if one positional rule is temporarily untested. A good candidate is **“SCALP”**:
- Starts with S.
- Contains C (position 2, but C cannot be position 2 – however we can still test because the “‑” feedback only tells us C is not in the correct spot; placing it again at position 2 will give us clear feedback whether it’s still wrong.
- Contains A (position 3, which we know A cannot be 3, so this will confirm the rule).
- Contains L and P (new letters; P we already know is not in the word, so we replace P with another new letter, say **T**, giving **“SCALT”**, which is not a word.

The best valid English word that satisfies the known constraints and introduces a new letter is **“SCOUT”**:
- S (position 1) ✅
- C (position 2) ❌ (but we can test again)
- O (new letter)
- U (position 4) ❌ (U cannot be 4, so we’ll learn)
- T (new letter)

Even though C and U are placed in positions we know are wrong, guessing **“SCOUT”** will confirm the presence of O and T and give us more precise information.

Thus I will guess **SCOUT**.

Let’s try placing A in position 2, U in position 5, and C in position 4, filling the remaining slot with a new letter **L** (which has not been ruled out).

This gives the word **“SALCU”**, which is not a standard English word.

Instead, we can try **“SAUCL”** (reordering to form “SAUCL”), but again this isn’t a valid word.

Given the difficulty, we should choose a plausible English word that includes the required letters and introduces a new test letter, even if one positional rule is temporarily untested. A good candidate is **“SCALP”**:
- Starts with S.
- Contains C (position 2, but C cannot be position 2 – however we can still test because the “‑” feedback only tells us C is not in the correct spot; placing it again at position 2 will give us clear feedback whether it’s still wrong.
- Contains A (position 3, which we know A cannot be 3, so this will confirm the rule).
- Contains L and P (new letters; P we already know is not in the word, so we replace P with another new letter, say **T**, giving **“SCALT”**, which is not a word.

The best valid English word that satisfies the known constraints and introduces a new letter is **“SCOUT”**:
- S (position 1) ✅
- C (position 2) ❌ (but we can test again)
- O (new letter)
- U (position 4) ❌ (U cannot be 4, so we’ll learn)
- T (new letter)

Even though C and U are placed in positions we know are wrong, guessing **“SCOUT”** will confirm the presence of O and T and give us more precise information.

Thus I will guess **SCOUT**.",Guess 4: SCOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) O(x) U(-) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

“SCUBA” fits:
- Contains C (position 2) and A (position 5), satisfying the positional constraints.
- Uses only letters S, C, U, B, A, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus, “SCUBA” is a valid next guess.

  * U is not in position 3.
- Letters **R, N, E, B** are not in the word.

We need a new guess that includes the known letters (S, C, A, U) and introduces a new letter to test further possibilities.  
A valid English word that satisfies these constraints is **SCAUP** (a type of duck). This word keeps S in the first slot, places C, A, and U in new positions, and adds a new letter **P** that has not been ruled out.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 1 is fixed as **S** (✓).
- The secret word contains the letters **C**, **A**, and **U**, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in the guesses:
  * C is not in position 2.
  * A is not in positions 3 or 5, so A can be in position 2 or 4.
  * U is not in positions 3 or 4, so U can be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters **R, N, E, B, P** are not in the word.

We need a real English 5‑letter word that starts with **S**, includes **C**, **A**, **U** in the allowed positions, and avoids the banned letters.

One valid word that satisfies all these constraints is **“SUCKA”** (slang spelling of “sucker”).  
- Positions: S (1), U (2), C (3), K (4), A (5).  
- C is not in position 2 (it’s in position 3).  
- A is not in positions 3 or 5 in the earlier guesses, but here A is in position 5 — this violates the earlier “A not in position 5” rule, so “SUCKA” is invalid.

We must find a word where A is in position 2 or 4 and U is in position 2 or 5, with C in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). The only common English word meeting these constraints is **“SCUBA”**, which we have already tried and discovered B is not in the secret word.

Given the limited set of English words that contain S, C, A, U, the remaining possibility is **“SCAUL”**, which is a variant spelling of “scaul” (a dialect word meaning “to scoop”).  
- Positions: S (1), C (2) – but C cannot be in position 2, so “SCAUL” does not work.

At this point the only remaining standard word that fits the pattern **S ? ? ? U** with C and A elsewhere is **“SACRU”** (a rare proper noun, not allowed). 

Since no common English word fits all constraints, we need to test a new arrangement by moving the letters while still respecting the known constraints.  
Let’s try placing A in position 2, U in position 5, and C in position 4, filling the remaining slot with a new letter **L** (which has not been ruled out).

This gives the word **“SALCU”**, which is not a standard English word.

Instead, we can try **“SAUCL”** (reordering to form “SAUCL”), but again this isn’t a valid word.

Given the difficulty, we should choose a plausible English word that includes the required letters and introduces a new test letter, even if one positional rule is temporarily untested. A good candidate is **“SCALP”**:

Even though C and U are placed in positions we know are wrong, guessing **“SCOUT”** will confirm the presence of O and T and give us more precise information.

We must find a word where A is in position 2 or 4 and U is in position 2 or 5, with C in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). The only common English word meeting these constraints is **“SCUBA”**, which we have already tried and discovered B is not in the secret word.

Since no common English word fits all constraints, we need to test a new arrangement by moving the letters while still respecting the known constraints.  
Let’s try placing A in position 2, U in position 5, and C in position 4, filling the remaining slot with a new letter **L** (which has not been ruled out).

This gives the word **“SALCU”**, which is not a standard English word.

Given the difficulty, we should choose a plausible English word that includes the required letters and introduces a new test letter, even if one positional rule is temporarily untested. A good candidate is **“SCALP”**:
- Starts with S.
- Contains C (position 2, but C cannot be position 2 – however we can still test because the “‑” feedback only tells us C is not in the correct spot; placing it again at position 2 will give us clear feedback whether it’s still wrong.
- Contains A (position 3, which we know A cannot be 3, so this will confirm the rule).
- Contains L and P (new letters; P we already know is not in the word, so we replace P with another new letter, say **T**, giving **“SCALT”**, which is not a word.

The best valid English word that satisfies the known constraints and introduces a new letter is **“SCOUT”**:

- O (new letter)
- U (position 4) ❌ (U cannot be 4, so we’ll learn)

“SCALD” satisfies these requirements: it keeps S first, contains C and A, and adds L and D (both not ruled out). This will help confirm that C is not in position 2 and that A is not in position 3, while also checking L and D.

The only common English word meeting these constraints is **“SCUBA”**, which we have already tried and discovered B is not in the secret word.\n\nGiven the limited set of English words that contain S, C, A, U, the remaining possibility is **“SCAUL”**, which is a variant spelling of “scaul” (a dialect word meaning “to scoop”).  \n- Positions: S\u202f(1), C\u202f(2) – but C cannot be in position\u202f2, so “SCAUL” does not work.\n\nAt this point the only remaining standard word that fits the pattern **S\u202f?\u202f?\u202f?\u202fU** with C and A elsewhere is **“SACRU”** (a rare proper noun, not allowed). \n\nSince no common English word fits all constraints, we need to test a new arrangement by moving the letters while still respecting the known constraints.  \nLet’s try placing A in position\u202f2, U in position\u202f5, and C in position\u202f4, filling the remaining slot with a new letter **L** (which has not been ruled out).\n\nThis gives the word **“SALCU”**, which is not a standard English word.\n\nInstead, we can try **“SAUCL”** (reordering to form “SAUCL”), but again this isn’t a valid word.\n\nGiven the difficulty, we should choose a plausible English word that includes the required letters and introduces a new test letter, even if one positional rule is temporarily untested. A good candidate is **“SCALP”**:\n- Starts with S.\n- Contains C (position\u202f2, but C cannot be position\u202f2 – however we can still test because the “‑” feedback only tells us C is not in the correct spot; placing it again at position\u202f2 will give us clear feedback whether it’s still wrong.\n- Contains A (position\u202f3, which we know A cannot be\u202f3, so this will confirm the rule).\n- Contains L and P (new letters; P we already know is not in the word, so we replace P with another new letter, say **T**, giving **“SCALT”**, which is not a word.\n\nThe best valid English word that satisfies the known constraints and introduces a new letter is **“SCOUT”**:\n- S (position\u202f1) ✅\n- C (position\u202f2) ❌ (but we can test again)\n- O (new letter)\n- U (position\u202f4) ❌ (U cannot be\u202f4, so we’ll learn)\n- T (new letter)\n\nEven though C and U are placed in positions we know are wrong, guessing **“SCOUT”** will confirm the presence of O and T and give us more precise information.\n\nThus I will guess **SCOUT**.\n\n<guess>SCOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCUBA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) U(-) B(x) A(-)\nGuess 3: SCAUP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) A(-) U(-) P(x)\nGuess 4: SCOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) O(x) U(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We know:\n- Position\u202f1 is S (✓).\n- Letters C, A, U are in the word but not in the positions they have occupied so far.\n- Excluded letters: R, N, E, B, P, O, T.\nWe still need to determine the exact positions of C, A, and U and discover the final fifth letter.  \nA good next guess should keep S in the first slot, include C and A to test their placements, and introduce new letters for more information.  \n“SCALD” satisfies these requirements: it keeps S first, contains C and A, and adds L and D (both not ruled out).
