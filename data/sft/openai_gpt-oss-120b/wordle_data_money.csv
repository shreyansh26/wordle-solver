### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- Letters C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Includes N and E (to test their positions).
2. Excludes C, R, A.
3. Places N and E in positions different from those ruled out.

A good candidate is **TONED**:
- Contains N (position 3) and E (position 4), both different from the forbidden spots.
- Uses only new letters T, O, D besides N and E, and none of them have been ruled out yet.

Thus the next guess will be TONED.

We have:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A are not in the word; N and E are present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We have determined that the secret word has O in position 2, N in position 3, and E in position 4 based on the feedback from previous guesses. The remaining unknown letters are at positions 1 and 5. The letters that have been ruled out so far are C, R, A, T, D, B, and S. Any candidate word must fit the pattern _ O N E _. 

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses letters not yet ruled out is **MONEY** (M O N E Y). This tests two new letters, M and Y, while keeping the known correct letters in their correct spots.

Thus the next guess should be MONEY.
