### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E. This should help narrow down which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know the secret word contains the letters R and A, but R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3. The letters C, N, and E are definitely not in the word. To get more information we need a new word that includes R and A in different positions, avoids the excluded letters, and introduces some fresh letters.

""RAILS"" fits:
- Contains both R and A.
- Places R at position 1 (not position 2) and A at position 2 (not position 3).
- Uses only new letters I, L, S besides R and A, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus ""RAILS"" is a good next guess.

We have gathered constraints from feedback:

- A is correct at position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 → R can be 3 or 4.
- L is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 → L can be 1 or 5.
- V is in the word but not in position 1 → V can be 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters C, N, E, I, S, O are not in the word.

Thus we must form a 5‑letter word using A, R, L, V plus one additional letter (which could be a repeat).  
The pattern that fits all constraints is **L A R V A**:

- L at position 1 (allowed),
- A at position 2 (confirmed),
- R at position 3 (allowed),
- V at position 4 (allowed, and not at position 1),
- A again at position 5 (no restriction against repeating A).

All letters are permitted and none of the eliminated letters appear. “LARVA” is a common English word, so it is a valid guess.
