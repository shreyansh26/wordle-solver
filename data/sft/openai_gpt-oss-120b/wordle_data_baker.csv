# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”: 
- R is not in position 2 
- A is not in position 3 
- E is not in position 5 
The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, avoids C and N, and introduces two new letters to help narrow down the remaining unknowns.

A good candidate is **RAVEL**:
- R is placed in position 1 (allowed, since it’s only forbidden in position 2).
- A is placed in position 2 (allowed, it’s only forbidden in position 3).
- E is placed in position 4 (allowed, it’s only forbidden in position 5).
- V and L are new letters that could be the remaining two letters of the secret word.

Thus “RAVEL” satisfies all constraints and will give us useful new information.
