### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a solid opening guess. A good first word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. 
- Common consonants: C, R, N, T, S, L, D
- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (I’ll include two different vowels).

“CRANE” uses the frequent consonants C, R, N and the two common vowels A and E, giving a balanced spread. It’s a popular opening guess that should reveal a lot of information about the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E**, contains **R** in position 1, 3, or 4, and must avoid C, A, N. I’ll choose a word that keeps E at the end, places R somewhere other than position 2, and introduces new letters to test. “ROUTE” fits: R is at position 1, and the letters O, U, T are new possibilities while respecting all constraints.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R is present but not in position 2; E is correct at position 5.
- From ROUTE: R is correct at position 1, O is not in the word, U is correct at position 3, T is not in the word, E is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: R _ U _ E.
Letters already excluded: C, A, N, O, T. 
We need a valid English word fitting R?U?E. A common word that fits is **REUSE** (R‑E‑U‑S‑E). It respects all constraints: R at position 1, U at position 3, E at position 5, and introduces new letters E (already allowed) and S (not excluded). This will confirm the remaining unknown letters.
