### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 3: ALGAE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) G(x) A(-) E(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Position 1: A is correct (✓).
- Position 2: L is correct (✓).
- Position 3: G is not in the word (x).
- Position 4: A is in the word but not in this spot (‑). Since we already have an A correctly placed at position 1, this indicates there is a second A elsewhere, and it cannot be at position 4.
- Position 5: E is correct (✓).

Therefore the secret word must be of the form **A L A _ E**, with the fourth letter being something other than G, C, R, N, P, S (all previously ruled out). A common English word fitting this pattern is **ALATE** (meaning “winged”).

So we will guess ALATE to test the fourth letter and confirm the second A at position 3.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Letters marked as not in the word (x): C, R, N, P, S, G, T.

The dash feedback for A in other positions just tells us A is somewhere (already satisfied by position 1), so we don’t need a second A.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **A L _ _ E** with the third and fourth letters chosen from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the excluded letters.

A common English word that matches this pattern and uses only unused letters is **ALIVE** (A‑L‑I‑V‑E).

So we will guess “ALIVE”.
