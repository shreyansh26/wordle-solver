### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

So the secret word must contain R somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.

I need a new guess that includes R in a different spot and introduces fresh letters to test. “SHRUB” works well:
- It places R at position 3 (allowed).
- It adds new letters S, H, U, B, none of which have been ruled out yet.
Thus “SHRUB” is a good next guess.
