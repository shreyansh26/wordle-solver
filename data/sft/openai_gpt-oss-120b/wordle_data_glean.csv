### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

Thus:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, M, G, O.

We need a new word containing A and N in allowed positions and three new letters not in the excluded set.  
Choosing A at position 1 and N at position 2 satisfies all positional constraints. A common word fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **ANTSY** (A N T S Y). None of T, S, Y are excluded, and the word is valid English.

So the next guess is ANTSY.

Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(-) G(-) O(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two previous guesses with feedback:
- CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x) → A and N are in the word but not in those positions. C, R, E are absent.
- MANGO: M(x), A(-), N(-), G(x), O(x) → A and N still present, not in positions 2 (A) or 3 (N). M, G, O are absent.

Thus:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, M, G, O.

We need a new word containing A and N in allowed positions and three new letters not in the excluded set.  
Choosing A at position 1 and N at position 2 satisfies all positional constraints. A common word fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **ANTSY** (A N T S Y). None of T, S, Y are excluded, and the word is valid English.

So the next guess is ANTSY.

Guess 3: ANTSY -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined that only letters A and N are known to be in the secret word. Their possible positions are constrained:
- A cannot be in positions 1,2,3 → A must be at position 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 2,3,4 → N must be at position 1 or 5.

The remaining positions must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (C,R,E,M,G,O,T,S,Y are absent). Choose a word that respects these placements and introduces fresh letters for testing.

A valid word meeting the constraints is **NIVAL**:
- N is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 4 (allowed).
- Uses new letters I, V, L which have not been tested yet.
Thus it will give useful new feedback.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- **A** is correct in position 4 (A✓).
- **N** is in the word but not in positions 1‑4, so it must be in position 5.
- **L** is in the word but not in position 5, so L must be in one of the first three positions.
- All letters marked **x** are not in the word: C, R, E, M, G, O, T, S, Y, I, V.
- The remaining possible letters (besides A, N, L) are: B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Z.

Thus the secret word has the pattern `???AN` with an **L** somewhere in the first three slots.

Looking through common 5‑letter English words that fit `???AN` and contain an L in the first three positions, **KULAN** fits perfectly:
- K U L A N → L is in position 3, A is in position 4, N is in position 5.
- None of its letters (K, U, L, A, N) have been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be **KULAN**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
