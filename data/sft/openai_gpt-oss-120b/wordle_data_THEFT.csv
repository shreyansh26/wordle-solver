### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N are not in the word (x). E is in the word but not in position 5 (‑).
2. LEVEL → L and V are not in the word (x). Both E’s are still not in positions 2 or 4 (‑).
3. EXIST → X, I, S are not in the word (x). E is also not in position 1 (‑). T is correct in position 5 (✓).

Summarizing:
- Forbidden letters: A, C, I, L, N, R, S, V, X (and also the other letters from those guesses).
- E must be in the word, only possible positions left are 3 (since 1,2,4,5 are ruled out).
- T is confirmed at position 5.
- Pattern is **_ _ E _ T** using only allowed letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, Y, Z.

Looking for a common English word matching that pattern, **THEFT** fits:
- T H E F T → E is at position 3, T is at position 5.
- All letters (T, H, E, F) are allowed.
