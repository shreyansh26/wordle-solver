### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- S, T, E are not in the secret word.
- L and A are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guess SLATE (positions 2 and 3 respectively).
Thus L cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3. We need a new 5‑letter word that includes L and A in other positions and avoids S, T, E. “LARVA” satisfies these constraints: L is at position 1, A at position 2 (both allowed), and it contains no prohibited letters.

From the feedback:
- Letters S, T, E, R, V are not in the secret word.
- The secret word contains L, but not in position 1 (from LARVA) and not in position 2 (from SLATE). So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word contains A at position 2 (A✓ in LARVA). 
- The secret word also contains another A, but not in position 5 (since the A at position 5 was marked “-”).

Thus the word needs:
- A in position 2.
- L somewhere in positions 3‑5 (not 1 or 2).
- A second A in a position other than 5 (so position 1, 3, or 4).
- No letters S, T, E, R, V.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **CANAL**:
- C A N A L
- A is at position 2 (correct).
- L is at position 5 (allowed).
- A appears again at position 4 (second A, not at position 5).
- No forbidden letters are used.

So “CANAL” is a valid next guess.
