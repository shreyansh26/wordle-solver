### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does not contain C, A, or N. It does contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5. I need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions (avoiding their previous spots) and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out. “SHRED” puts R at position 3 and E at position 4, and avoids C, A, N, so it’s a good candidate.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word contains **E** at position 4 (✓ from SHRED).
- It also contains **R**, but R is not in position 2 (CRANE) nor position 3 (SHRED). Thus R can be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, S, H, D (all marked x).

We need a new guess that keeps **E** at position 4, places **R** at a possible spot (1 or 5), and introduces three new letters to test.  
Choosing **R** at position 1 and filling the remaining spots with unused letters gives the word **RIVET** (R I V E T). I, V, and T have not been eliminated yet and are common enough to test.
