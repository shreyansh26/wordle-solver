### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with any valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is frequently used because it includes the common letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know the secret word contains the letters C, A, and E, but not R or N. From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C, A, and E placed in different positions than those ruled out, and avoids R and N. “DECAL” fits:
- D E C A L
- C is at position 3 (allowed),
- A is at position 4 (allowed),
- E is at position 2 (allowed),
- No R or N appear.

Thus “DECAL” is a logical next guess.

We have determined the exact positions for four letters:
- Position 2 is E (✓ from DECAL)
- Position 3 is C (✓)
- Position 4 is A (✓)
- Position 5 is L (✓)

The only unknown is position 1, which cannot be D (x from DECAL), R, N (both x from CRANE). A valid English word fitting the pattern _E C A L is **FECAL**. The letter F has not been ruled out, so this is a sensible next guess.
