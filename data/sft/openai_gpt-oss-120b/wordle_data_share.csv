### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 5.

So the secret word has the form _ _ A _ E, includes R somewhere except position 2, and does not contain C or N. A good candidate fitting these constraints is ""GLARE"" (G L A R E), which places R at position 4 (allowed) and avoids the banned letters.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 3 = A (confirmed)
- Position 4 = R (confirmed)
- Position 5 = E (confirmed)

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, G, L.
R cannot be in position 2, but it is already placed at position 4, which is fine.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form __ARE that avoids the excluded letters. Viable candidates include “SHARE”, “SPARE”, etc. “SPARE” uses only letters not ruled out, so it’s a good next guess.
