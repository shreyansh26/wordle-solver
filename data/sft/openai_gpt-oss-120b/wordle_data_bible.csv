### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game, I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and a couple of less common ones. This helps gather information about the secret word’s letters and their positions. A good opening guess is “CRANE”.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- Letters **L** and **I** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “SLIDE” (L cannot be in position 2, I cannot be in position 3).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, S, D** are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing L and I in different allowable positions, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **BILGE** fits:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I (position 2) and L (position 3), both different from the forbidden positions.
- Uses only new letters B and G, which we haven’t tested yet.

Thus we’ll guess **BILGE** to confirm the positions of I and L and test new letters.
