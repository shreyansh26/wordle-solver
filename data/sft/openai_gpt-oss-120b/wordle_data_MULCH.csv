### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that only the letter C is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1. All other letters (R, A, N, E) are not present at all. For the next guess we should include C in a different position and try several new letters to gather more information, while avoiding the excluded letters.

We know from feedback:
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- U is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters R, A, N, E, S, O, T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C and U, placing them in allowed positions, and filling the other three spots with letters not excluded.  

A good candidate is **MULCH**:
- Positions: M(1) U(2) L(3) C(4) H(5)
- C is at position 4 (allowed), U is at position 2 (allowed), and none of the other letters are excluded.
