### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- Letters **C** and **N** are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the previous guesses.
  * C cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2 or 4.
  * N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1 or 3.
- So C must be at position 2 or 4, and N must be at position 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters (not in the word): R, A, U, L.

A common English word that fits all these constraints is **SCONE**:
- Pattern: S C O N E → C is at position 2, N is at position 4, and the word ends with E.
- It contains none of the excluded letters.

Thus **SCONE** is a logical next guess.
