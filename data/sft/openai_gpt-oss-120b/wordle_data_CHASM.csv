### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess for the secret 5‑letter word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. “CRANE” includes two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), which should give a good spread of information.

We know the secret word has C in position 1 and A in position 3. Letters R, N, and E are confirmed absent. We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5 with letters that are not those banned and also not repeating known letters unless the secret contains duplicates. Choosing a common word that fits the pattern C?A?? will give informative feedback. ""CHAMP"" fits: C H A M P, using letters H, M, P that we haven't tested yet and avoiding the banned letters.

We have:
- Position 1: C correct.
- Position 2: H correct.
- Position 3: A correct.
- Position 4: M is in the word but not here, so M must be elsewhere.
- Position 5: P not in the word.

Since the only remaining open slots are positions 4 and 5, and M cannot be position 4, M must be position 5. Thus the word pattern is C H A _ M. We need a common English word fitting this pattern with a new fourth letter that hasn't been ruled out. “CHASM” (C H A S M) satisfies the pattern and uses a new letter S, which hasn't been excluded.

Therefore the next guess is CHASM.
