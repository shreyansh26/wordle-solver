### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess CRANE the feedback tells us:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position.

So the secret word must contain R, A, and E, but:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes R, A, and E placed in different spots, avoids C and N, and adds a few fresh letters to test more possibilities. 

“RAPED” satisfies these constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- No C or N present
- Introduces new letters P and D for further clues.

Thus the next guess is RAPED.

   - C, N are not in the word.

- A can only be in positions 1, 4, 5.
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, 3 (but not 4 or 5).

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

We have the following confirmed info:
- Position 1 = S (✓ from SERAI)
- Position 4 = A (✓ from SERAI)
- Letters R, E are in the word but still misplaced.
- From earlier feedback R cannot be in positions 1,2,3; therefore R must be in position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 4; it can be in position 3 (the only remaining spot for E).

Thus the word pattern is **S _ E A R**.

We need a valid English word matching that pattern and that uses a new, untested letter at position 2 to gain more information.  
Possible words: SMEAR, SHEAR, SWEAR.  

Choosing **SMEAR** introduces the new letter **M** at position 2, letting us test another consonant without violating any known constraints.

- Position 4 = A (✓ from SERAI)
- Letters R, E are in the word but still misplaced.
- From earlier feedback R cannot be in positions 1,2,3; therefore R must be in position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 4; it can be in position 3 (the only remaining spot for E).

Thus the word pattern is **S _ E A R**.

We need a valid English word matching that pattern and that uses a new, untested letter at position 2 to gain more information.  
Possible words: SMEAR, SHEAR, SWEAR.  

Choosing **SMEAR** introduces the new letter **M** at position 2, letting us test another consonant without violating any known constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes the common letters C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving me useful information for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess CRANE the feedback tells us:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position.

So the secret word must contain R, A, and E, but:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes R, A, and E placed in different spots, avoids C and N, and adds a few fresh letters to test more possibilities. 

“RAPED” satisfies these constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- No C or N present
- Introduces new letters P and D for further clues.

Thus the next guess is RAPED.

Guess 2: RAPED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) P(x) E(-) D(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - C, N are not in the word.
   - R, A, E are present but in wrong positions.
   - R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5.

2. RAPED → R(-) A(-) P(x) E(-) D(x)
   - P, D are not in the word.
   - R, A, E are present but still in wrong positions.
   - R not in position 1 (now also not 2), A not in position 2 (now also not 3), E not in position 4 (now also not 5).

So far the letters known to be in the secret word are **R, A, E**, and they must satisfy:
- R can only be in positions 3, 4, 5.
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, 5.
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, 3 (but not 4 or 5).

A word that fulfills all these constraints and does not use any excluded letters (C, N, P, D) is **SERAI**:
- Position 1 = S (allowed)
- Position 2 = E (E allowed here)
- Position 3 = R (R allowed here)
- Position 4 = A (A allowed here)
- Position 5 = I (new letter, allowed)

Thus SERAI is a valid next guess complying with all known information.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 1 = S (confirmed)
- Position 4 = A (confirmed)
- Position 3 = E (confirmed from SMEAR)
- Position 5 = R (confirmed from SMEAR)

Thus the word is **S _ E A R**.

Letters known not to be in the word: C, N, P, D, I, M (all marked “x” in earlier guesses).  
The remaining unknown letter is at position 2 and must not be any of those eliminated letters.

Valid English words matching the pattern are:

- SHEAR (uses H)
- SWEAR (uses W)

Both satisfy all constraints, and both introduce a new, untested letter. Choosing one will let us identify the correct word. I will guess **SHEAR** to test the letter H.
