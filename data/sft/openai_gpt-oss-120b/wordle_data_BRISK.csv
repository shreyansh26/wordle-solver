### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
Thus the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _. We need a five‑letter word with R as the second letter and none of the eliminated letters. “FRUIT” (F R U I T) satisfies these constraints, so it is a good next guess.

From the feedback:
- The second letter is R (✓).
- Letters C, A, N, E, F, U, T are not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ R _ _ _, must contain I (in position 1, 3, or 5) and avoid the excluded letters. A good candidate meeting all constraints is **PRISM** (P‑R‑I‑S‑M): second letter R, includes I at position 3, and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

We have determined the secret word structure from feedback:

- Position 2 is R (confirmed).
- Position 3 is I (confirmed).
- Position 4 is S (confirmed).
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N, E, F, U, T, P, M.
- Remaining unknown letters are position 1 and 5, which must be from the alphabet excluding eliminated letters and not already used (except duplication is allowed but not indicated).

Looking for common English words fitting the pattern _ R I S _. Candidates:
- BRISK (B R I S K) – uses B and K, which are not eliminated.
- Others like GRIST, WRIST involve T (eliminated) or other excluded letters.

BRISK is the most plausible candidate, so we will guess that.
