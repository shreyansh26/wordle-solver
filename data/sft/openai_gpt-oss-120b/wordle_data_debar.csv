### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”.
  - R is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
  - E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Includes R, A, and E in different positions from the first guess.
2. Avoids C and N entirely.
3. Introduces a few new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **ALERT**:
- A moves to position 1 (was 3 before).
- L is a new letter.
- E moves to position 3 (was 5 before).
- R moves to position 4 (was 2 before).
- T is a new letter.

This satisfies all the constraints and gives us fresh letters to test.

- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”.
  - R is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
  - E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Includes R, A, and E in different positions from the first guess.
2. Avoids C and N entirely.
3. Introduces a few new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **ALERT**:
- A moves to position 1 (was 3 before).
- L is a new letter.
- E moves to position 3 (was 5 before).
- R moves to position 4 (was 2 before).
- T is a new letter.

This satisfies all the constraints and gives us fresh letters to test.

We need a guess that places A, R, E in new positions respecting those constraints and introduces two fresh letters (not C, N, L, T).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
