### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give me useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and the vowel A, plus the common ending “NE”. This should give a clear feedback pattern for the next steps.

We know:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- Letter C is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters A and N are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word matching pattern _ R _ _ E, containing C at position 3 or 4, and avoiding A and N. “TRUCE” (T‑R‑U‑C‑E) satisfies all constraints:
- R is in position 2.
- E is in position 5.
- C is in position 4 (not position 1).
- No A or N present.
