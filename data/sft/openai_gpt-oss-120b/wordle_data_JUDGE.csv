### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 3: D (✓)
- Position 4: G (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the secret word is of the form _ U D G E.

Letters that have been ruled out for any position (X feedback) are: C, R, A, N, M, O, S, B, F. The first letter cannot be any of these.

The only common English word that fits the pattern ?UDGE with a first letter not excluded is **JUDGE** (J is still possible). Therefore the next logical guess is ""JUDGE"".
