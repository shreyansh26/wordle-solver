### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letter N, but N is NOT in the 4th position (since it was marked ""-"" in CRANE).

From previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, E, G, H, T are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in positions 1 (from NIGHT) or 4 (from CRANE). So N can be 2, 3, or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (from NIGHT). So I can be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word containing both N and I, respecting those position constraints, and using only letters not ruled out.

The word **UNION** fits:
- Contains N (positions 2 and 5) – both allowed.
- Contains I (position 3) – allowed.
- Uses letters U and O, which have not been eliminated.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus “UNION” is a valid next guess.
