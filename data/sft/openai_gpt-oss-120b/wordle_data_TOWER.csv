### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is one that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants, which can give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is frequently used for this purpose because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I will use it as my first guess.

We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Does not place R in the 2nd slot or E in the 5th slot.
3. Avoids the letters C, A, N.
4. Uses other letters to gather new information.

“RULER” fits these criteria:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) and E (position 4).
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- No C, A, or N.
- Introduces new letters U, L, and another R for more clues.

Thus the next guess will be “RULER”.

We know from feedback:
- The secret word ends with **R** (position 5) and has **E** at position 4.
- The first R in “RULER” was marked “-”, meaning the only R is at position 5.
- Letters **C, A, N, U, L** are not in the word.
- We need a new word of the form *** _ _ _ E R *** that avoids the excluded letters and tests new common letters.

A good candidate is **TIMER** (T I M E R). It fits the pattern, uses none of the forbidden letters, and introduces three fresh letters (T, I, M) for more information.
