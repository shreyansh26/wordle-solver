### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined from previous feedback:

- The third letter is I (I is correct at position 3).
- The fifth letter is N (N is correct at position 5).
- Letters L, G, C, R, E are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is A _ I _ N. We need a common English word fitting this pattern using letters not yet ruled out. “ASIAN” matches: A (pos1) correct, S (pos2) unknown, I (pos3) correct, A (pos4) allowed (duplicate A not ruled out), N (pos5) correct.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:
- Position 1 is A (✓).
- Position 3 is I (✓).
- Position 4 is O (✓).
- Position 5 is N (✓).
- Letters C, R, E, L, G, S are not in the word.
- N is not in position 2 (the N in ANION was marked “-”), but N already occupies position 5, so the word contains only one N at the end.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **A _ I O N**.

We need a common English word that fits this pattern using only letters not ruled out. The most plausible candidate is **AVION** (A‑V‑I‑O‑N). It respects all known positions and introduces a new letter V to test whether it belongs in the word.

Hence the next guess should be **AVION**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
