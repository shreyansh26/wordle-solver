I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it uses frequently occurring letters and will give useful information about vowels and common consonants.

We know the first letter is C and it’s correctly placed. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all, so the next guess must keep C in position 1 and avoid those letters. I’ll choose a word with common remaining letters to get more information. “CLOUT” fits: C L O U T, none of the forbidden letters appear.

We have C L O fixed in positions 1-3. T is present but not in position5, so must be in position4 because positions1-3 are already correct. U is not in word. Thus pattern is C L O T _. The only common word fitting is ""CLOTH"".
