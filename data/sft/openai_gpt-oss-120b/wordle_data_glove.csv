### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word‑guessing game with a solid first guess.  
A good opening word uses common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.  
“CRANE” contains two very common letters (C, R) and the two most frequent vowels (A, E) plus an N, which is also frequent. This should give a clear pattern of which letters are present and where they belong.

We have determined the pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is L (✓)
- Position 3 is O (✓)
- Position 5 is E (✓)

From BLOKE we learned:
- Position 1 is not B
- Position 4 is not K

All letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, N, S, I, D, F, U, T, B, K.
Remaining candidates for positions 1 and 4 include G, H, J, M, O (if allowed repeats), P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting ""? L O ? E"" with allowed letters is **GLOVE** (G L O V E). G and V have not been ruled out, and the word is a valid guess.

Thus the next guess should be ""GLOVE"".
