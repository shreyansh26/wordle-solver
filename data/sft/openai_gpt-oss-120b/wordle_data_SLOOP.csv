### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N). This should give a broad initial clue about which letters are present and their positions.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are marked absent, so the secret word cannot contain any of those. I need a new five‑letter word using only other common letters. “SLOTH” uses S, L, O, T, H, none of which have been ruled out, and it’s a valid English word. This should give fresh information about which of those letters are present and their positions.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Positions 1‑3 are S, L, O respectively (✓ indicates correct letter and position).
- Letters T and H are not in the word.
- From the first guess, C, R, A, N, E are also not in the word.

So the secret word looks like **S L O _ _**. We need a valid English word that starts with ""SLO"" and uses only letters that haven't been ruled out. Possible candidates include:
- **SLOOP** (uses P, which hasn’t been guessed yet)
- **SLOWS** (uses W, also not guessed)
Both fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,T,H). I’ll try one of them.
