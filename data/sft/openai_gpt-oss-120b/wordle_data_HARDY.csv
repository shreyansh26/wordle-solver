### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does not contain S, L, T, or E. It does contain the letter A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position (since in SLATE it was marked “-”). Therefore the next guess must include A in a different position and must avoid S, L, T, E. I choose the word “MAYOR”: it contains A in the 2nd slot, and all other letters (M, Y, O, R) are still possible.

We have:
- From SLATE: S, L, T, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3.
- From MAYOR: A is correct in position 2; Y and R are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively; M, O are not in the word.

So the secret word structure is: _ A _ _ _. It must contain Y and R, placed away from their guessed spots (Y not in position 3, R not in position 5). Choose a common word that fits these constraints and uses new letters for the remaining slots.

""HARPY"" satisfies:
- A is in position 2.
- Contains R (position 3, allowed) and Y (position 5, allowed).
- Uses new letters H and P, which are not excluded.
Thus it is a valid next guess.
