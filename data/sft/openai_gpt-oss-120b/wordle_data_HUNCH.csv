### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, R, O, Y are not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain C and N, placed elsewhere, and must avoid all eliminated letters. A good candidate that introduces new letters while respecting these constraints is **PINCH** (P I N C H). Here C is in position 4 (different from position 1) and N is in position 3 (different from position 4). No eliminated letters are present.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Positions 2‑5 are confirmed as **U N C H**.
- The first letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E, R, O, Y, P, I, B) and must form a valid English word.
- Possible candidates are **MUNCH**, **HUNCH**, etc. HUNCH would require a second H, which is unlikely and not supported by any hints. MUNCH fits the pattern with a new, allowable first letter **M**.
Thus the next logical guess is **MUNCH**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have determined the pattern _ U N C H from the feedback:
- Positions 2‑5 are U, N, C, H respectively.
- The first letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E, R, O, Y, P, I, B, M, C is already used at position 4).
- The only common English word matching ""?UNCH"" with allowed letters is **HUNCH** (H at position 1). This does not conflict with any previous clues, and duplicate H is permissible because we have no evidence against it.
