### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I'll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel positions. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowels A and E, giving useful information about the secret word's composition and letter placement.

The previous feedback tells us:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct at position 2.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must have the form _ R _ _ _, contain A (not in slot 3) and N (not in slot 4), and exclude C and E.

A viable word fitting these constraints is **ARSON**:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- R is at position 2 (matches the known correct spot).
- S at 3, O at 4 (neither A nor N, and N is not at 4).
- N at position 5 (allowed and satisfies the presence of N).

So I will guess “ARSON”.
