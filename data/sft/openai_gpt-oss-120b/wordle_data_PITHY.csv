### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have gathered the following information from the feedback:

- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U, F, L, W are not in the word.
- I is correct at position 2.
- T is correct at position 3.
- H is correct at position 4.
- Y is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ I T H Y. The only common English word fitting that pattern and using only allowed letters is **PITHY** (P I T H Y). The letter P has not been ruled out by any previous feedback.

Therefore the next guess should be ""PITHY"".
