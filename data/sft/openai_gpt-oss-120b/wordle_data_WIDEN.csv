### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have deduced:
- N is correct at position 5 (from MELON feedback).
- E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from both guesses), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters C, R, A, M, L, O are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in N, containing E in one of the allowed spots, and avoiding the excluded letters. “SHEEN” fits:
- Pattern S H E E N → N is at position 5.
- E appears in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed).
- Uses only new letters S, H, which have not been ruled out.
Thus it gives new information about the remaining unknown letters.

- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, M, L, O, S, H (all marked x).

Thus the pattern is **_ _ _ E N**, with only the letters C,R,A,M,L,O,S,H excluded.  
A word that fits this pattern and uses only unknown letters is **QUEEN** (Q U E E N).

- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, M, L, O, S, H (all marked x).

Thus the pattern is **_ _ _ E N**, with only the letters C,R,A,M,L,O,S,H excluded.  
A word that fits this pattern and uses only unknown letters is **QUEEN** (Q U E E N).  
Q and U have not been tried yet, and the duplicate E would give exactly the feedback we have received (first E → “-”, second E → “✓”). Therefore “QUEEN” is a logical next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern:

- Position 3 cannot be E (E received “-” at pos3 in QUEEN)

We need a common English word fitting ___EN with the given constraints. “GIVEN” satisfies:
- Ends with EN, with E in position 4 and N in position 5.
- Uses new letters G, I, V that have not been ruled out.
- No letter conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore the next logical guess is “GIVEN”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
