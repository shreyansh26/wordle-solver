### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common starter word that covers a variety of common letters and vowel positions. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and both a frequent vowel (A) and a less frequent vowel (E). This should give useful information for the next steps.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain C, E, and R (with R locked at the second spot). No A or N. C cannot be position 1, E cannot be position 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **FRECK**:
- R is in the correct second position.
- C appears in position 4 (different from position 1 in the guess).
- E appears in position 3 (different from position 5 in the guess).
- No A or N are present.

Therefore the next logical guess is “FRECK”.
