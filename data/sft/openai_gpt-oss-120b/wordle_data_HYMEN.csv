### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all. The letters N and E are in the word but are not in the positions we placed them in (N was fourth, E was fifth in “CRANE”). Therefore:
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes both N and E, respects those positional restrictions, and avoids C, R, and A. “MELON” fits:
- Contains N (position 5) and E (position 2), both in allowed spots.
- Uses only letters M, L, O besides N and E, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it is a legal and informative next guess.
