### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word must contain A and N elsewhere, and avoid C, R, E.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Excluded letters: C, R, E, M, G, O, V.
- Position constraints:
  * A cannot be 1,2,3 → can be 4 or 5.
  * I cannot be 4 → can be 1,3,5.
  * L cannot be 5 → can be 1,3,4.
- Need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ N _ _ _ using A, I, L plus one new letter not excluded.

The word **INLAW** satisfies all:
- N is in position 2.
- I (pos1) not forbidden.
- L (pos3) not forbidden.
- A (pos4) allowed.
- W (pos5) is a fresh letter not ruled out.

Thus the next guess is INLAW.

The feedback shows that the first four letters are fixed: I (position 1), N (2), L (3), A (4). Position 5 is not W and must be a valid letter not previously ruled out (C,R,E,M,G,O,V,W). A common English word fitting the pattern **INLA_** is **INLAY** (the Y is a new, allowed letter). This should complete the secret word.
