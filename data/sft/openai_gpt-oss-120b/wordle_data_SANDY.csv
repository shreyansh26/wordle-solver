### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback shows A appears twice in the word (one ✓ at position 2, another – at position 4 in BANAL), so the second A cannot be at position 4 and also cannot be at position 1 (ANIMA gave A(-) at position 1). Therefore the second A must be at position 5.

Thus the word pattern is: _ A N _ A.

All letters marked x are eliminated: B, C, E, I, L, M, R (and also the letters C, R, E from guess 1). Remaining usable letters include S, T, D, G, H, etc.

A common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **SANTA** (S A N T A). This satisfies all positional constraints and includes the second A at position 5.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: ANIMA -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) I(x) M(x) A(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = A (from BANAL ✓)
- Position 3 = N (from BANAL ✓)

Feedback shows A appears twice in the word (one ✓ at position 2, another – at position 4 in BANAL), so the second A cannot be at position 4 and also cannot be at position 1 (ANIMA gave A(-) at position 1). Therefore the second A must be at position 5.

Thus the word pattern is: _ A N _ A.

All letters marked x are eliminated: B, C, E, I, L, M, R (and also the letters C, R, E from guess 1). Remaining usable letters include S, T, D, G, H, etc.

A common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **SANTA** (S A N T A). This satisfies all positional constraints and includes the second A at position 5.
