### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or E. It DOES contain A and N, but A is NOT in the 3rd position and N is NOT in the 4th position. So we need a new word that includes A and N in different slots, avoids C,R,E, and introduces new letters to gather more info. “MANGO” places A in position 2 and N in position 3, satisfying the positional constraints, and adds the fresh letters M, G, O for testing.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, E, M, G, O are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is: A _ _ _ N, with V somewhere not position 3, I somewhere not position 4, and the remaining slot filled by a new letter (or a duplicate A). A possible word that satisfies all constraints is **AVIAN** (A at 1, V at 2, I at 3, A at 4, N at 5). This uses V and I in allowed positions and respects all known exclusions.
