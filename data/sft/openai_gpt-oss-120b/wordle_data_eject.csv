# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We need a valid 5‑letter word fitting E??CT with letters not yet eliminated. Possible candidates include “ELECT” (E L E C T) and “EJECT” (E J E C T). Both fit the pattern and use only new letters (L or J) that haven’t been ruled out.

We have deduced the following from the feedback:

- Position 1 is **E** (confirmed by guesses 2, 3, 4).
- Position 3 is also **E** (guess 4 gave a ✓ on the third letter).
- Position 4 is **C** (confirmed by guesses 2, 3, 4).
- Position 5 is **T** (confirmed by guess 3 and 4).
- Position 2 cannot be **L** (guess 4 gave an x on L) and cannot be any letters that have been marked absent: R, A, N, P, O, H, V, I, L.

Thus the word pattern is **E _ E C T** with the second letter still unknown, but it must be a letter not yet eliminated. A common English word fitting this pattern is **EJECT**, where the missing letter is **J**, which has not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “EJECT”.
