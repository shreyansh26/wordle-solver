### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have determined the secret word must start with C in position 1, have A in position 2, and E in position 4. Letters D, R, N, T are ruled out, and E cannot be at position 5. The remaining unknown slots are positions 3 and 5. A common English word fitting the pattern C A _ E _ is **CAMEO**, which places M in position 3 and O in position 5, both letters not yet ruled out. This guess will test those letters.
