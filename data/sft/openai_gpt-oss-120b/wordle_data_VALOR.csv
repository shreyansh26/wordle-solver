### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, T, E are not in the secret word.
- L and A are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3).

So the secret word must contain L and A somewhere else, and must avoid S, T, and E. I need a new five‑letter word that includes L and A in different slots and introduces new letters to test. “MOLAR” fits: it has L at position 3 and A at position 4 (both different from the previous guess) and adds M, O, R as new letters, none of which have been ruled out.

From the feedback:
- L is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 2.
- A is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4.

Thus the pattern is _ _ L _ R, with A and O placed somewhere in the remaining slots, respecting their restrictions.  
A can be in positions 1 or 2 (not 3,4,5).  
O can be in positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2; position 3 is L, position 5 is R, so O can be in 1 or 4.

A possible English word satisfying all these constraints is **VALOR**:
- V A L O R
- L at 3 (✓) and R at 5 (✓) match the fixed letters.
- A is at 2 (allowed) and O is at 4 (allowed, not position 2).

Therefore ""VALOR"" is a strong next guess.
