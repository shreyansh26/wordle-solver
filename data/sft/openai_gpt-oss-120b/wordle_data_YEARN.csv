### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a frequent opening guess in these games because it tests several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) in different positions.

We know:
- Position 3 is A (correct).
- Letters R, N, E are in the word but not in their previous positions (R not 2, N not 4, E not 5).
- C is not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word with A third and containing R, N, E placed elsewhere, avoiding the prohibited spots.  
The word **LEARN** fits:
- L E A R N → A is third.
- R is in position 4 (not position 2).
- N is in position 5 (not position 4).
- E is in position 2 (not position 5).
- No C present.

Thus LEARN is a valid next guess.

We have determined the exact letters for positions 2-5: E A R N with those placements confirmed by the second guess feedback. Position 1 is still unknown, but it cannot be C or L (both ruled out). The word pattern is _EARN. A common English word fitting that pattern is ""YEARN"". It uses Y in the first position, which hasn't been eliminated, and completes a valid 5‑letter word.
