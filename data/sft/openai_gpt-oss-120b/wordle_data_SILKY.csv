### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E) and will give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent. I need a new five‑letter word that does not contain any of those letters. Choosing common letters like S, O, L, I, D will give useful information while respecting the restriction.

We know from feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 3 is L (✓).
- Letter I is in the word but not in position 4; therefore I must be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, O, D are not in the word.
We need a valid 5‑letter word matching S _ L _ _. Placing I at position 2 gives the pattern S I L _ _. “SILKY” fits this pattern, uses allowed letters (K, Y), and respects all constraints.
