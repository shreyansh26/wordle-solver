### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated many letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,B,L,O,W,S,F,Z.
Feedback from FUZZY: U and Y are correct in their positions (2 and 5). F is in the word but not at position 1. Z is not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ U _ _ Y, containing F somewhere other than the first position. Considering remaining possible letters (D, J, K, P, Q, V, X) and the need for F, a common word fitting the pattern is **PUFFY** (P U F F Y). This uses only allowed letters, places F in positions 3 and 4 (not first), and matches the known correct positions for U and Y. It’s a strong candidate, so we will guess PUFFY.
