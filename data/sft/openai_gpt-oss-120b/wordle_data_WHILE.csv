### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us:
- The last letter is E (✓).
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word has the pattern _ _ _ _ E, with none of the banned letters appearing elsewhere. I need a common five‑letter word that ends in E and avoids C, R, A, N. “SLIDE” fits: S L I D E, with E in the correct spot and no prohibited letters.

We have the pattern _ _ I _ E from previous feedback. 
- Position 3 is I (✓). 
- Position 5 is E (✓). 
- Letter L is present but not in position 2 (marked “-”), so L must be in position 1 or 4. 
- Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, N, S, D, and also the first guess ruled out those letters anywhere. 

A common word fitting the pattern with L in position 4 is **WHILE** (W H I L E). 
- It uses no banned letters. 
- L is in the correct (non‑2) position. 
- All other constraints are satisfied.

Thus the next guess should be WHILE.
