### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- From guess 3 (REBEL):  
  - R at position 1 is correct (✓).  
  - E at position 2 is correct (✓).  
  - B at position 3 is not in the word (x).  
  - E at position 4 is correct (✓).  
  - L at position 5 is correct (✓).

Thus the secret word currently fits the pattern **R E _ E L**, with the third letter unknown. The third letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters {B, C, A, N, S, I}. A common English word matching this pattern is **REVEL** (R E V E L), where V has not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “REVEL”.

The known pattern from feedback is R (position 1) E (position 2) _ (position 3) E (position 4) L (position 5).  
Letters eliminated so far are: C, A, N, S, I, B, V.  
We need a valid English word matching R E ? E L where the third letter is not any eliminated letter.  
“REPEL” fits perfectly: R E P E L, with P not eliminated.
