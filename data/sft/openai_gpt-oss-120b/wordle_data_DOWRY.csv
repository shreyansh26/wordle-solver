### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter R is present but not in position 2 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). For the next guess we should include R in a different position and avoid using C, A, N, or E. A word like “RUGBY” meets these criteria: it contains R (now at position 1), and all other letters (U, G, B, Y) are fresh possibilities. This will let us test R’s correct spot and introduce new letters.

- Remaining possible letters for the unknown positions are the unused alphabet letters (D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, etc.).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form ___RY with O in slot 1 or 2 and using only allowed letters. A common English word that fits is **WORRY** (W O R R Y):  
- Y is in position 5, R in position 4 (✓).  
- O is in position 2 (could be correct or need to move).  
- The other letters (W and the extra R) are new candidates.

This guess will confirm the exact spot for O and test W, giving us the next step.

We have determined the fixed letters from feedback:
- Position 2: O (correct)
- Position 4: R (correct)
- Position 5: Y (correct)

The letter W is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 3.  
The remaining unknown letter occupies position 1 and must be a letter not yet ruled out (e.g., D, F, H, I, etc.).

A common English word that fits the pattern _ O W R Y is **DOWRY** (D‑O‑W‑R‑Y). This uses the required letters in the correct spots and introduces a new plausible first letter.

Thus the next guess is DOWRY.
