### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct in position 4.

We have determined from the feedback:
- Position 2 = A (correct).
- Position 3 = N (correct).
- Position 4 = N (correct).
- Position 5 = Y (correct).
- Position 1 is not F, C, R, E, L, O, G, P, I, T, or any letter already proven absent.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ A N N Y. A plausible English word matching this pattern and using only allowed letters is **MANNY** (meaning a manservant). This uses M, which has not been ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word must have N as the fourth letter, contain an A in position 1, 2, or 5, and avoid the letters C, R, and E. A common word fitting these constraints is **ALONG** (A‑L‑O‑N‑G). It places A in position 1, puts N correctly in position 4, and uses no prohibited letters.

- Letters C, R, E, L, O, G are not in the word.

Trying a word with A in position 2 and N in position 4 gives the pattern _ A _ N _.  
“PAINT” fits this pattern (P A I N T) and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out. It should provide new information about the remaining positions.

Thus the pattern is _ A _ N _. Remaining possible letters for the other spots are any not yet excluded.

A good candidate that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **FANNY** (F A N N Y):
- F and Y have not been ruled out.
- It keeps A in position 2 and N in position 4.
- It tests whether there is a second N at position 3 and introduces new letters F and Y.

- Position 3 = N (✓ from FANNY, MANNY)
- Position 4 = N (✓ from FANNY, MANNY)
- Position 5 = Y (✓ from FANNY, MANNY)
