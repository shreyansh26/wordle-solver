### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5 is correct). The letters S, L, A, and T are not in the word at any position, so they should be avoided in future guesses. To gather more information, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses other common letters, avoiding S, L, A, T. “CHORE” fits: C, H, O, R, E – none of the excluded letters, and it ends with E, giving us a chance to test new letters while confirming the final E.

Current constraints:
- Position 3 = O (from CHORE with O marked correct).
- Position 5 = E (from both guesses).
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (since R was marked '-' when in position 4). Therefore R must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters excluded completely: S, L, A, T, C, H (they received 'x' feedback).
- Letters known to be present: O, E, R.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ O _ E, containing R in position 1 or 2, and using only letters not excluded.

“DRONE” fits:
- D (new letter) in position 1,
- R in position 2 (satisfies R’s placement),
- O in position 3 (matches known correct position),
- N (new letter) in position 4,
- E in position 5 (confirmed correct).

All letters are allowed and the word is valid English.

Thus the next guess will be DRONE.
