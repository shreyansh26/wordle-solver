### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and varied positions. ""SLATE"" is a frequent opening guess in word‑guessing games because it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). This should give me useful feedback on which letters are present and their locations.

All letters from the first guess (S, L, A, T, E) are confirmed not to be in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely. Choosing a common word with different letters will give useful information. “BRICK” contains B, R, I, C, K, none of which appeared in the previous guess, so it’s a good next attempt.

We know S, L, A, T, E, R, C, K are not in the secret word. From the second guess we have B and I present, but B is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3. So we need a 5‑letter word using B and I (in other positions) and three other allowed letters (from D, F, G, H, J, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) without using any excluded letters.

A viable word is **UNBID**:
- Letters: U N B I D – none are excluded.
- B is in position 3 (not position 1).
- I is in position 4 (not position 3).

Thus it satisfies all constraints and gives new information.
