# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game, I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

From the feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes both R and A, avoids C, N, E, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and A somewhere other than the third slot.

The word “RADIO” satisfies these conditions:
- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both not in the forbidden positions.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (D, I, O are all still possible).
Thus “RADIO” is a logical next guess.

We know from feedback that the secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were guessed.  
- A cannot be in positions 1‑4, so it must be the 5th letter.  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5, so it can be in position 3 or 4.  

All letters marked “x” are ruled out: C, N, E, D, I, O, L, T.  
Thus the remaining positions must be filled with letters that are not among those excluded.

A valid 5‑letter word that satisfies:
- ends with A,
- has R in position 4 (allowed),
- uses only allowed letters (U, M, B, R, A),

is **UMBRA**.

This guess respects all known constraints and introduces new letters to further narrow the solution.
