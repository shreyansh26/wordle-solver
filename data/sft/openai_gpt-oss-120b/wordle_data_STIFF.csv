### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with S (position 1 correct). The letters L, A, and E are not present anywhere. The letter T is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore T must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Choosing a common word that begins with S, includes T in a different spot, and avoids L, A, E gives us many options (e.g., “STORM”, “SHIRT”, “SPOUT”). “STORM” places T in position 2, which satisfies the T constraint, and introduces new letters O, R, M that haven’t been ruled out.

We have confirmed the first three letters of the secret word:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: T (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)

Eliminated letters (cannot appear anywhere) are: L, A, E, O, R, M, N, G, C, K.

We need letters for positions 4 and 5, using only the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). A common English word fitting the pattern **STI??** and using only allowed letters is **STIFF** (adds F in both remaining spots). This will test whether F is in the secret word.

Thus the next guess should be:
