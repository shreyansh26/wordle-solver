### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, well‑balanced word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” contains two frequent vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word ends with E, and the letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints: the fifth letter must be E, and the guess should avoid using C, R, A, N. A good candidate is **SLIDE** – it ends with E and uses only S, L, I, D, which have not been ruled out yet.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 = L (from SLIDE)
- Position 5 = E (from both guesses)
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, I, D

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ L _ _ E, using only letters not yet eliminated. We should choose a guess that respects the known positions and introduces new letters to learn more. A good candidate is **PLUME** (P L U M E), which fits the pattern and adds three fresh letters (P, U, M) for testing.
