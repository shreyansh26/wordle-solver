### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequent letters to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This should help narrow down possible letters and positions after the first feedback.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters. Choosing a common word with fresh letters will give useful information. “SHOUT” uses S, H, O, U, T – none are among the eliminated letters.
