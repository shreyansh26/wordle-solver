### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since I have no information yet about the secret word, I'll choose a common word that contains a mix of commonly used letters. ""TABLE"" includes T, A, B, L, and E, which will give me a good spread of feedback to work from.

From the feedback, the secret word includes the letter T but not in the first position. It does NOT contain A, B, L, or E. I need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints and places T elsewhere. Choosing ""CRUST"" gives me T at the last position and introduces new letters C, R, U, S to test.

We have confirmed that the secret word ends with T (position 5) and contains the letter R, but R is not in position 2. The letters A, B, L, E, C, U, and S are ruled out. We need a new 5‑letter word ending with T, placing R somewhere other than the second slot, and avoiding the excluded letters. “RIGHT” satisfies these conditions: it ends with T, puts R in position 1, and introduces new letters I, G, H for further testing.
