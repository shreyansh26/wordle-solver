### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback: the secret word starts with **S** (position 1 is correct). The letters **L, A, T, E** are not present anywhere in the word. Therefore the pattern is:

S _ _ _ _

with the remaining four positions to be filled using letters other than L, A, T, E, and also not S (since S was only marked correct at position 1).  

I need a guess that introduces several new letters while respecting these constraints. “SCRUB” fits:
- Starts with S
- Uses letters C, R, U, B, none of which have been ruled out
- Contains only allowed letters

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: S (confirmed).
- Position 2: unknown, cannot be O, L, A, T, E, C, R, B, D.
- Position 3: U (confirmed).
- Position 4: N (confirmed).
- Position 5: unknown, cannot be O, L, A, T, E, C, R, B, D.

We need a valid 5‑letter word that fits S _ U N _. Choosing letters not yet excluded gives the best chance of narrowing down the solution. “SPUNK” fits perfectly:
- Starts with S.
- Has U in position 3 and N in position 4 as required.
- Introduces two new letters, P and K, which have not been tried and are not among the excluded letters.
Thus “SPUNK” is an optimal next guess.

We have the pattern from feedback:

- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: unknown, but letters P and other eliminated letters are not allowed.
- Position 3: U (correct)
- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: unknown, K is not allowed.

Eliminated letters so far: L, A, T, E, C, R, B, D, O, P, K, and also T from the first guess. Remaining possible letters include F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word matching S _ U N _. Looking through the possibilities, **SWUNG** (S‑W‑U‑N‑G) fits the pattern, uses only letters not yet ruled out (W and G), and is a common word.

Thus the next guess should be SWUNG.
