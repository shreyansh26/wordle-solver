### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with an initial valid 5‑letter word. I'll choose a common word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information early on. “ARISE” is a good starter because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give a broad sense of which letters are present and their positions.

We need a word of the form _ R _ S _. Choose a word that introduces new letters while respecting known constraints. “CRUSH” fits: C R U S H, introduces C, U, H, none of which have been ruled out, and matches the pattern.
