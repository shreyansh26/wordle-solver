### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that the first two letters are M and I in the correct positions. The letters G, H, and T are not in the word, and earlier we excluded C, R, A, N, E. So the secret word looks like:

1️⃣ M  
2️⃣ I  
3️⃣ ?  
4️⃣ ?  
5️⃣ ?

We need a valid English word starting with ""MI"" that does not contain any excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T). 

Possible candidates: **MILLS** (M I L L S) – uses only M, I, L, S, none of which have been ruled out. It fits the pattern and is a common word.

Thus, the next guess will be ""MILLS"".

- Letter S is in the word but not in position 5 (feedback ""-"").

Thus the pattern is M I _ _ _. The remaining letters cannot be any of C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T,L. The only letters we have not ruled out that can complete the word are those like B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since S must appear and cannot be at position 5, the viable place for S is position 3 or 4 (or both). A common English word fitting these constraints is **MISSY** (M I S S Y), which places S in positions 3 and 4 and uses Y, a letter not yet excluded.
