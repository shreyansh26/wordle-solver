We know:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 4; possible positions are 1,3,5.
- Letters C, A, E are not in the word.
We need a guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to test. “BROWN” fits:
- R stays at position 2.
- N moves to position 5 (allowed).
- New letters B, O, W are tested and none are excluded.
Thus “BROWN” is a valid next guess.
