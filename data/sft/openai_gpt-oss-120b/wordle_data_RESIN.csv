### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE, we know:

We need a five‑letter word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and N somewhere other than the fourth slot.

The word **RONDO** fits:

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 4: I (✓)
- Position 5: N (✓)

All other letters used so far have been marked x, so they are not in the secret word:
C, A, E, O, D, H, Y, M, U, T.

Thus the unknown letters are at positions 2 and 3, and must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (B F G J K L P Q S V W X Z).  
A plausible next guess that respects the known pattern **R _ _ I N** and uses only allowed letters is **RAVIN** (testing the vowel A and the consonant V). Even though A was previously marked x, it’s worth confirming in case of any mis‑interpretation of the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess CRANE, we know:
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a five‑letter word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and N somewhere other than the fourth slot.

The word **RONDO** fits:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3).
- No C, A, or E.
- R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4.

Thus, “RONDO” is a valid next guess.
