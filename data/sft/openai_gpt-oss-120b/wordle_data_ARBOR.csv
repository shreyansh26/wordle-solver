### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me:
- R is correct in the second position.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like _ R _ _ _. The letter A must be in position 1, 4, or 5. I need a valid 5‑letter English word with R as the second letter, containing A elsewhere, and without C, N, or E.

“ARROW” fits:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (matches the known correct spot).
- The remaining letters (R, O, W) don’t conflict with any excluded letters.
Thus “ARROW” is a good next guess.

From the feedback:
- Position 1: A is correct (✓).
- Position 2: R is correct (✓).
- Position 4: O is correct (✓).
- The second R in ARROW (position 3) got a “-”, meaning R is in the word but not in position 3. Since we already have an R at position 2, the extra R must be elsewhere, leaving only position 5 as possible. So position 5 is R.
Thus the word pattern is: A R _ O R.

We need a valid English word fitting that pattern, using letters not already ruled out (C, N, E, W are out). A common word matching the pattern is **ARBOR** (A‑R‑B‑O‑R). The letter B hasn't been eliminated, and the word satisfies all positional constraints.
