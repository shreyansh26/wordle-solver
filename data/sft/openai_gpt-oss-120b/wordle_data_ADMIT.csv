### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a solid, common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowel pair A‑E, giving a balanced chance to learn about the secret word’s letters and positions.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (marked -).

So the next guess must:
1. Exclude the letters C, R, N, and E entirely.
2. Include the letter A, placed in a position other than the third.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “BALMY” works:
- Letters: B A L M Y – none are C, R, N, or E.
- A is in the second position, not the third.

Thus “BALMY” is a valid next guess.

From previous guesses:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, L, Y.
- Letters in the word: A and M.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (it was wrong in both those spots).
- M cannot be in position 4 (it was wrong there).

We need a 5‑letter word that includes A and M, places A only in positions 1, 4, or 5, and places M in any position except 4. The remaining three letters must avoid the excluded set.

A suitable word is **ADMIT**:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- M is at position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- D, I, T are letters not previously ruled out.

Thus ADMIT satisfies all constraints.
