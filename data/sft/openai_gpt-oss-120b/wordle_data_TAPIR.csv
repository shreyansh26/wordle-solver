### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two common letters (C, R) and the frequent vowel A and another vowel E. This should give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

From the previous feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes both R and A, places them in different positions from the previous guess, and avoids C, N, and E.

""TARPS"" satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A (position 2, allowed) and R (position 3, allowed because R only cannot be in position 2).
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (T, P, S are still possible).
- No C, N, or E appear.

Thus ""TARPS"" is a valid next guess.
