### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening guess uses common letters and varied positions. “SLATE” contains frequent letters S, L, A, T, E and covers a mix of consonants and a vowel. This should give informative feedback for the next steps.

From the feedback on SLATE, only the letter T is correct and in the right spot (fourth position). The letters S, L, A, and E are not in the secret word at all. Therefore the secret word has the pattern _ _ _ T _. I need a valid five‑letter word with T as the fourth letter and without using S, L, A, or E. “MIRTH” fits: M I R T H, with T in the fourth position and none of the excluded letters.
