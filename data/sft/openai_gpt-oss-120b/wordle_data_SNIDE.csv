### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- E is correct at position 5 (✓).
- N is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4 (both guesses gave “-” for N in those spots). Therefore N must be in position 1 or 2.

Letters ruled out completely (because they received an “x” in both guesses): C, R, A, L, U, G.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing N at position 1 or 2, and avoiding the forbidden letters.  

A good candidate is **KNIFE**:
- Pattern K N I F E fits (N in position 2, E in position 5).
- None of the letters K, I, F have been tried yet, and none are among the excluded letters.
Thus KNIFE is a logical next guess.
