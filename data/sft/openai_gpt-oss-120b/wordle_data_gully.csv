### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are present and where they might belong.

We know from previous feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, I. The only confirmed letter is L, but it is NOT in the 5th position (since in SPOIL it was at position 5 and got a “-”). So L must be somewhere in positions 1‑4.

We need a new word that:
- Includes L (not at position 5).
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.
- Introduces several fresh letters to gain more information.

The letters still possible are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is **BULKY**:
- Contains L in position 3 (acceptable).
- Introduces B, U, K, Y, all of which are still unknown.
- All letters are allowed.

Thus we guess “BULKY”.
