### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that S, T, and E are absent. L and A are present but in wrong positions: L was position 2, A was position 3 in the guess SLATE. Therefore new guess must place L somewhere other than position 2 and A somewhere other than position 3, while avoiding S, T, E entirely. Choosing a word that also introduces new letters helps narrow possibilities. “BALMY” satisfies all constraints: it includes L at position 3 and A at position 2 (both different from previous spots), contains none of the excluded letters, and adds B, M, Y for more information.

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **INLAW** (I‑N‑L‑A‑W). It satisfies all constraints and introduces three new letters (I, N, W) for further narrowing.

- A is correct at position 4.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern __LA_ with allowed letters from the remaining alphabet (C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.). 

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **INLAW** (I‑N‑L‑A‑W). It satisfies all constraints and introduces three new letters (I, N, W) for further narrowing.

Now we guess:

All letters marked x are not in the word:
S, T, E, B, M, Y, P, O, R, I, N, W.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
