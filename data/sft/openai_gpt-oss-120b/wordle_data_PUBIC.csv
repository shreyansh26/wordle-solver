### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but C is not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. Therefore, the next guess should include C (not as the first letter) and avoid using R, A, N, and E. A good candidate is “SCOUT,” which places C in the second position and uses only letters not ruled out.

We have two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1. R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. SCOUT → S(x), C(-) means C is still in the word but not in position 2 either. O(x) means O is not in the word. U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 4. T(x) is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The secret word contains **C** (not in positions 1 or 2).
- It contains **U** (not in position 4).
- It does **not** contain the letters R, A, N, E, S, O, T.

We need a new guess that includes C and U in allowed positions and introduces three fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is **LUCKY**:
- C is in position 3 (allowed).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, not position 4).
- L, K, Y are new letters that haven’t been eliminated.

Thus “LUCKY” satisfies all known constraints and will give us more information.

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **PUBIC**:
- Pattern: P U B I C → U is in position 2 (✓), C is in position 5 (allowed), and none of the letters are among the excluded set.
