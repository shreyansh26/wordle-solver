### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Word ends with E (position 5 is correct).
- Letters C, R, N are not in the word.
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was third in “CRANE”). So A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
We need a new guess that respects these constraints, keeps E at the end, avoids C, R, N, and places A somewhere other than the third slot.

A good candidate is **ALIVE**:
- Positions: A 1, L 2, I 3, V 4, E 5.
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- E remains at position 5.
- No prohibited letters C, R, N appear.

Thus this guess will test new letters L, I, V while keeping known constraints.
