### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I’ll start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and includes both a vowel and consonants in varied positions. “SLATE” is a good starter because it tests S, L, A, T, and E, covering common consonants and the vowel A.

We know from feedback that the secret word has L in the second position, and the letters S, A, T, and E are not present anywhere. We need a new 5‑letter word with L as the second letter and avoiding those excluded letters. “CLOUD” fits: C L O U D, with L in the correct spot and none of the forbidden letters.
