### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game, I’ll choose a common, vowel‑rich word that can give information about several letters and their positions. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it contains a mix of common consonants (C, R, N) and two different vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are in the secret word and whether any are in the correct spot.

- Letters eliminated so far: C, N, E, P, T, Y, D, S.
- Remaining unknown letters for positions 1, 4, 5 must be from the unused alphabet, and one of them must be K (not at position 4).

A word that fits the pattern and satisfies all constraints is **KARMA**:
