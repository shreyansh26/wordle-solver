### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: D (✓)

The only unknown is the first letter. Forbidden letters from previous Xs are C, A, N, T, I, F, G, plus any other letters not yet tried. The only common English word fitting the pattern _ R E E D with a permissible first letter is **BREED**. All other candidates (GREED, CREED) have first letters already marked as incorrect.
Thus the next guess should be BREED.
