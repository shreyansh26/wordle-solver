### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified the confirmed letters:
- A is correct in position 2.
- T is correct in position 4.
All letters marked x are not in the word: C, R, N, E, G, L, O, F, I, H, B, S.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5 are any not yet eliminated: D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly repeats of A or T).

We need a common English word matching the pattern _ A _ T _. Considering the allowed letters, “PATTY” (P A T T Y) fits:
- Position 1: P (allowed)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Position 3: T (allowed, not yet ruled out)
- Position 4: T (confirmed)
- Position 5: Y (allowed)

All letters are from the allowed set, and the word is a valid English word. This guess will test whether the third position is also T and introduce the new letters P and Y.

Thus we guess “PATTY”.
