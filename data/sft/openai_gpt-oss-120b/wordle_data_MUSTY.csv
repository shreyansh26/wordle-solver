### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- M is correct in position 1.
- I, G, H are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.
All letters from CRANE (C,R,A,N,E) are also not in the word.

So the secret word starts with **M**, contains a **T** somewhere in positions 2‑4, and must avoid the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H}.  
Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints will give the most information.

The word **MOTTY** fits:
- M in position 1 (✓ already known).
- Contains T in positions 3 and 4 (so T is not in position 5).
- Uses only new letters O and Y, which have not been ruled out.
Thus it respects all known information and introduces two fresh letters.

We will guess **MOTTY**.

- Letters **C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, O** are all absent (marked x).
- Remaining positions (2 and 3) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

A common word that fits the pattern **M _ _ T Y** and uses only allowable letters is **MUSTY** (M‑U‑S‑T‑Y). It introduces two new letters U and S, giving us more information while respecting all constraints.
