We have fixed letters:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)

From guess CANAL:
- Position 4 (A) got “-”, meaning A is in the word but not here. Since we already have A at position 2, this suggests there is a second A somewhere else, most likely position 5.
- Position 5 (L) got “x”, so L is not in the word.

Thus the pattern is C A N _ A, with the fourth letter still unknown but not any of the eliminated letters (R, E, D, Y, T, S, L). A common English word that fits is **CANNA** (C‑A‑N‑N‑A), which introduces a second N (allowed) and places the second A at the final position.

We will guess “CANNA”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have confirmed the first three letters: C (position 1), A (position 2), N (position 3).

Feedback analysis:
- From CANAL: position 4 was A and got “-”, so A is in the word but not at position 4. Since A is already at position 2, this just confirms A’s existence; it also tells us position 4 is NOT A.
- From CANNA: position 4 was N and got “-”, so N is in the word but not at position 4 → position 4 is NOT N.
- From CANNA: position 5 was A and got “-”, so A is NOT at position 5.

Thus positions 4 and 5 must be letters other than A, N, and any letters previously ruled out (R, E, D, Y, T, S, L). A common English word fitting the pattern **C A N _ _** with those constraints is **CANON** (C‑A‑N‑O‑N). This uses O (still untested) and repeats N, which is allowed since N is already known to be in the word.

We will guess “CANON”.
