### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, H, Y are not in the word.
- G is correct at position 1.
- U is correct at position 2.
- T is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from earlier) and also not at position 5 (from guess2). So the only remaining spot for T is position 4.
- S is in the word but not at position 4, leaving positions 3 or 5.
Thus the pattern is: G (1), U (2), ?, T (4), ?. The possible placements are:
- S at position 3 and an unknown letter at position 5, giving “G U S T _”.
- Or S at position 5 and an unknown letter at position 3, giving “G U _ T S”.

A common English word that fits the first pattern is **GUSTO** (G U S T O). It uses allowed letters, places S at position 3, T at 4, and introduces O, a letter not yet ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be GUSTO.
