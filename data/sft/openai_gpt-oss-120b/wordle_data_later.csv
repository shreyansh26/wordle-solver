### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have the following information:

- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3, so it can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E is in the word but not at positions 5 or 1, so it can be at 3 or 4 (position 2 is A).
- T is in the word but not at position 4, so it can be at 1, 3, or 5.
- Letters C, N, H are not in the word.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
* keeps A in the second spot,
* includes R, E, and T in positions that respect the constraints,
* adds a fresh letter for more information.

The word **RATES** fits:
- R at position 1 (allowed),
- A at position 2 (✓),
- T at position 3 (allowed, T is not at 4),
- E at position 4 (allowed),
- S is a new letter.

Thus the guess “RATES” will test all required letters while obeying the known constraints.
