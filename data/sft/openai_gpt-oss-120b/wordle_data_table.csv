### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ _ E, with A somewhere in positions 1‑4 except 3. I need a new guess that respects these constraints, avoids C, R, N, and places A in a different spot. “LAPSE” fits: L A P S E, with A in position 2 and E still in position 5, and it contains none of the excluded letters.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E (A is confirmed at position 2, E at position 5).
- Letter L is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""L(-)"" on guess LAPSE). Therefore L must be at position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, P, S (and any other letters that received an ""x"").
- All other letters are still possible.

A common English word that satisfies these constraints is **TABLE**:
- Positions: T A B L E → A is in position 2, E in position 5.
- L appears in position 4, satisfying the “L in the word but wrong position” rule.
- None of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, P, S) appear.

Thus “TABLE” is a valid next guess.
