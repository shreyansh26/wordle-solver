### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

The only unknown is position 2. Letters that have been tried and marked absent: C, R, A, T, O, H, P, plus the already placed correct letters. Remaining alphabet letters include B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The pattern S ? I N E suggests common English words. One valid word is **SWINE** (S‑W‑I‑N‑E), which uses a new letter W at the second position and fits all known constraints. This will test the only remaining slot.

Thus the next guess should be SWINE.
