### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1 is **C** (✓ from all guesses).
- Position 3 is **A** (✓ from all guesses).
- Letters **R, N, E, O, S, T, M, P** are not in the word (x).
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (‑ from CLAMP), so L must be in position 4 or 5.

Thus the pattern is **C _ A _ _**, with L occupying either the fourth or fifth slot.

We need a common English word fitting this pattern, using only letters not yet ruled out.  
A good candidate is **CHALK**:

- C (position 1) ✔
- H (new letter, not excluded)
- A (position 3) ✔
- L (position 4) satisfies the “L is elsewhere” clue
- K (new letter, not excluded)

This guess tests two new letters (H and K) and places L where it can be correct.
