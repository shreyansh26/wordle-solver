### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

The first guess CRANE gave us: C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore the next guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, N completely.
- Include the letter E, but place it somewhere other than position 5.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “MELTS” works well: it contains E in position 2, and all other letters (M, L, T, S) are allowed.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, M, L, T, S are not in the word.
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and MELTS).
Thus E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5‑letter word using only allowed letters (B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and placing E in one of the allowed spots. “EPOXY” fits perfectly: E is at position 1, and the other letters (P, O, X, Y) have not been eliminated.

Therefore the next guess should be:
