### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- CRANE: all letters C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- SHIFT: only I is correct and in the correct position (third letter). All other letters S,H,F,T are also not in the word.

Thus, the secret word has pattern __I__ (I fixed at position 3). The letters that cannot appear anywhere are: C,R,A,N,E,S,H,F,T. Remaining possible letters are the rest of the alphabet, especially those not yet tried.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word with I as the third letter, using only allowed letters. “DOILY” fits perfectly:
- D, O, I, L, Y are all letters we have not ruled out.
- I is in the third position as required.
- “Doily” is a common English word (a small ornamental mat).

Hence the next guess will be DOILY.
