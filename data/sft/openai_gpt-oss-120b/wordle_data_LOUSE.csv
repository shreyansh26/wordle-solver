### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common starter like “CRANE” includes a mix of common letters and vowels, which should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know:
- Secret word ends with E (position 5 correct).
- Letters S and L are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in SLIDE: S cannot be position 1, L cannot be position 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, I, D.
We need a new 5‑letter word containing both S and L, respecting those position constraints, and avoiding excluded letters. “LOUSE” fits:
- L at position 1 (allowed),
- O and U are unused letters,
- S at position 4 (S not in position 1),
- E at position 5 (correct).
Thus we guess LOUSE.
