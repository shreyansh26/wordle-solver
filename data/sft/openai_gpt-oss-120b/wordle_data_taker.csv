### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess **CRANE** we learned:
- C and N are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than they appeared in **CRANE**.
  * R cannot be in position 2.
  * A cannot be in position 3.
  * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains R, A, and E, avoids C and N, and places those three letters in positions other than the ones ruled out.  
**EARTH** satisfies all of these conditions:
- Contains E (position 1, not 5), A (position 2, not 3), and R (position 3, not 2).
- Uses only new letters (L, T, H) for the remaining slots, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it is a good candidate for the next guess.
