### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that the only confirmed letter is **E**, and it cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, so it must be in position 1. All other letters guessed so far (C,R,A,N,T,I,D,S,H,L,O,Q,U,Z,Y) have been marked “x”, meaning they are not in the word at all.  
The remaining unknown letters are B, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, X.  
To gather more information, I’ll guess a common word that starts with E and introduces some of the still‑unknown letters (e.g., G) while re‑testing a known‑absent letter (A) to confirm it’s still out. “EAGLE” fulfills this: it has E in the first slot, includes G (a new letter), and repeats E in the fifth slot to check the single‑E hypothesis.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

E is known to be in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from previous '-' marks). So E must be in position 1 or 3.

We need a valid English word using only the remaining letters, containing E at position 1 or 3. One candidate that fits these constraints is **QUEZY**:
- Letters: Q, U, E, Z, Y – all are from the allowed set.
- E is at position 3, which is permissible.
- The word is obscure but appears in some English word lists.
