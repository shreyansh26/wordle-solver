### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells us that the first letter is S and that L, A, T, and E are not present anywhere in the secret word. I need a new guess that keeps S in the first position and avoids the letters L, A, T, and E. Choosing a word with several new letters will give us more information. “SPURN” fits these constraints (S P U R N) and introduces four fresh letters.

We have the following information:

- The letters **N**, **I**, and **C** are in the word, but each is in a different position than they appeared in the guesses:
  * N is not in position 2 (SNICK) and not in position 5 (SPURN) → N can be in position 3 or 4.
  * I is not in position 3 (SNICK) → I can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
  * C is not in position 4 (SNICK) → C can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Starts with **S**,
- Contains **N**, **I**, **C** in the allowed spots,
- Uses a fifth letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

The word **SONIC** fits perfectly:
- S is in position 1.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 4 (allowed).
- C is in position 5 (allowed).
- The remaining letter **O** has not been excluded.
