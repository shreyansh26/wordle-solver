### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, L, T are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain A and E somewhere else, and must avoid S, L, T.  
A good candidate that follows those constraints is **MAKER** (M A K E R): it includes A (position 2) and E (position 4), and contains none of the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: S, L, T, M, K.

So the word pattern is _ A _ E R.

Possible words fitting this pattern and not using excluded letters include:
- CAPER

- RACER

Choosing ""CAPER"" as a common word without any excluded letters.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- Positions 2,4,5 are fixed as A, E, R respectively.
- Letter P is in the word but not in position 3, and cannot be at positions 2,4,5 (already occupied), so P must be the first letter.
Thus the word pattern is **P A _ E R**.
The remaining third letter must be a letter not yet excluded (S, L, T, M, K, C) and not already used (A, E, R, P). Viable common words include **PAGER** (third letter G) or **PAYER** (third letter Y). Both satisfy all known constraints.
