### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess that is a common 5‑letter English word, which will give the system feedback to continue the game. “CRANE” is a good starter because it contains commonly used letters and a mix of consonants and a vowel.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word has A as the third letter, contains a C somewhere other than the first position, and does not contain R, N, or E.  

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “SCAMP” fits:
- Position 1: S (allowed)
- Position 2: C (C is present and not in position 1)
- Position 3: A (matches the known correct letter)
- Position 4: M (allowed)
- Position 5: P (allowed)

So I will guess SCAMP.
