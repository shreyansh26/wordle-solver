### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C, R, E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but in different positions than they appeared in CRANE (A was 3rd, N was 4th). So A ≠ position 3, N ≠ position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N in other positions, avoids C, R, E, and introduces other letters to test. “JUNTA” satisfies:

We know the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.

From CRANE:
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, R, E are not in the word.

From JUNTA:
- A is still not in the guessed position 5.
- N is still not in the guessed position 3.
- J, U, T are not in the word.

So:
- A can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Positions 3 cannot be A or N.
- Positions 4 cannot be N.
- Positions 5 cannot be A.

A good pattern that satisfies these constraints is **_ A _ _ N** (A in 2, N in 5).  
We need a real word fitting that pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out. “MASON” fits perfectly:
- M (new), A (allowed in position 2), S (new), O (new), N (allowed in position 5).

Thus “MASON” will test new letters while keeping A and N in viable spots.
