### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with C (✓). R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they had in CRANE: R not at position 2, A not at position 3, E not at position 5. So we need a new word beginning with C, placing R, A, E in other slots. A good candidate is **CATER** (C A T E R): 
- C stays in position 1.
- A moves to position 2 (allowed).
- E moves to position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- R moves to position 5 (allowed, not position 2).
This will test the remaining letters and give more info.

We have determined the exact letters and positions for four of the five slots:

- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Position 4: E (confirmed)
- Position 5: R (confirmed)

The only unknown is the third letter. It cannot be N or T (both marked absent). Any other consonant or vowel could fit, provided it forms a valid English word. The word **CAPER** fits the pattern C‑A‑P‑E‑R and introduces a new letter P, which we have not yet tested. This will tell us whether P belongs in the secret word and confirm the final position.

Thus the next guess should be ""CAPER"".
