### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 1: S (correct).
- Position 3: U (correct).
- Position 4: N (correct).
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2.
Thus the word pattern is S T U N _.

All letters marked X (not in the word) are: C, R, A, E, M, O, D, P, L, K, H.  
Remaining possible letters for the final position are those not excluded, such as G, B, F, I, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word that fits the pattern S T U N _ is **STUNG**, using G which has not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “STUNG”.
