### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to give me useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the vowel A and the common consonants C, R, N, and E.

We know from the first guess that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (the last spot). For the next guess we should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E in a different position (1‑4).
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A suitable word is **BEGOT**: it contains E at position 2, and introduces B, G, O, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have the following information:

- Letters **C, R, A, N, B, G, T** are not in the secret word (all marked x).
- Letter **E** is in the word but not in positions 5 (from guess 1) nor 2 (from guess 2). So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Letter **O** is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 2). So O can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both E and O in allowed positions and avoids the excluded letters.  
“VOWEL” fits perfectly:
- V O W E L → O is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed).
- All its letters (V, O, W, E, L) are not among the excluded ones.

Thus “VOWEL” is a good next guess to test the positions of O and E and to introduce three new letters (V, W, L).
