### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a variety of common letters. “CRANE” is a good initial guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E) which will give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- R, A, and E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (‑ indicates wrong spot).

So the pattern is C _ _ _ _. N must be somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5. We need a common five‑letter word that fits these constraints and avoids the excluded letters.

The word **CINCH** fits:
- Starts with C.
- Contains N in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses only new letters I, H and repeats C, none of which have been ruled out.
- Does not contain R, A, or E.

Thus the next guess should be CINCH.

We have:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- Letters R, A, I, E, H are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (both guesses gave “-” for N at those spots), so N must be in position 2 or 5.
- The second C in the guess got “-”, meaning there is a C somewhere else in the word (the game marks a repeated C as “-” if the letter appears anywhere, even if already matched). So the word may contain only one C, but the extra C still gets “-”.

A good candidate is a word that starts with C, ends with N, and avoids the forbidden letters. **CLOWN** fits:
- C _ _ _ N pattern (C at 1, N at 5).
- Uses only new letters L, O, W, none of which have been excluded.
- Satisfies all the feedback constraints.

Thus the next guess should be “CLOWN”.
