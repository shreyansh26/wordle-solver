### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the new guess must:
- Exclude S, L, T, E.
- Include A in a position other than 3.

""MANGO"" fits: it contains A (position 2), and none of the excluded letters.

We have the following information from feedback:

- From guess 1 (SLATE): S, L, T, E are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 3.
- From guess 2 (MANGO): M, N, G, O are not in the word. A is correct in position 2.

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _. The letters that cannot appear are S, L, T, E, M, N, G, O. We need a valid 5‑letter word with A in the second slot and using only allowed letters.

A good candidate is **JAZZY** (J A Z Z Y). It fits the pattern, uses only letters that have not been ruled out, and is a common English word.

So the next guess will be JAZZY.
