### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that the only known correct letter is A, which is not in positions 3 or 4 (from CRANE and GLOAT). Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

All other letters tried so far are ruled out:
- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, G, L, O, T.
We need a new word that places A in one of the allowed positions and introduces fresh letters.

The word **MASKS** fits:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Letters M, S, K are all unused so far.
- No eliminated letters appear.

Thus “MASKS” is a valid next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

We need a new word that places A in one of the allowed positions and introduces fresh letters.

The word **MASKS** fits:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Letters M, S, K are all unused so far.
- No eliminated letters appear.

Thus “MASKS” is a valid next guess.

Thus the secret word pattern is **M A _ _ _**.  
All letters that have been ruled out so far are: C, R, N, E, G, L, O, T, S, K.  
We need to choose a word starting with “MA” that introduces new letters not yet tested, while avoiding the eliminated ones.

A good candidate is **MAFIA**:
- It keeps the known “MA” in the correct spots.
- It tests two fresh letters, **F** and **I**, which have not been tried yet.
- It doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “MAFIA”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
