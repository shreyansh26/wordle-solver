### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess uses common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, or “AEGIS” are popular first guesses. I’ll choose “CRANE” because it contains two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which should give a broad set of clues.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- Letters C, R, A, I, D, X are not in the word.
- Letter N is in the word but not in positions 2 (from INDEX) or 4 (from CRANE).
- Letter E is in the word and is correctly placed at position 4 (from INDEX). It cannot be position 5 (from CRANE).
Thus the pattern is _ _ _ E _. N can be in position 1, 3, or 5, but not 2 or 4.
We need a valid English word with E in the fourth slot and containing N elsewhere, using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.
The word **BONES** fits:
- B O N E S → E is fourth, N is third (allowed), and B, O, S are new letters.
- No eliminated letters appear.
So ""BONES"" is a good next guess.

- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, I, D, X, B, O, S.
- N is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4. Therefore N can be in position 1 or 5.
- E is definitely in position 4 (from the second guess).

So the pattern is either **N _ _ E _** or **_ _ _ E N**.

All remaining possible letters are: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z (and the already‑known N and E).

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ _ _ E N** and uses only allowed letters is **QUEEN** (Q U E E N).  
It places E correctly in position 4 and puts N at position 5, satisfying the constraints.

Thus the next guess will be “QUEEN”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
