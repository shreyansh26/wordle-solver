### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new five‑letter guess that avoids those letters entirely. Choosing a word with common letters that aren’t among the excluded ones will give the most information. “SLIMY” uses S, L, I, M, and Y—none of which have been ruled out—so it’s a good next guess.

From the feedback:
- T is not in the word.
- O is correct in position 2.
- The first F is present but not in position 3.
- The second F is correct in position 4.
- Y is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word has the pattern _ O _ F Y with O at 2, F at 4, Y at 5. The first F being yellow only tells us an F exists somewhere (position 4), not necessarily that there’s a second F.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **GOOFY** (G O O F Y). It uses a new letter G in position 1 and repeats O in position 3, which we have not ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be GOOFY.
