### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- Position 4 is I (✓).
- The first I in CIVIL was marked “-”, meaning I exists elsewhere besides position 2 – we already have it at position 4, so the secret definitely contains I at position 4. (If duplicates are considered, there may be another I, but we can still try a word with a single I.)
- Letters that are not in the word: R, A, N, E, V, L.

Thus the secret pattern is **C _ _ I _**, using none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate that fits those constraints is **CUPID** (C U P I D): it starts with C, has I in the fourth spot, and contains none of the forbidden letters.

So the next guess will be “CUPID”.
