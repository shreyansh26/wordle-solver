### Game Rules:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback that:
- A is correct in the 3rd position.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position (it was guessed in position 4 previously).
- Letters C, R, and E are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form __A__ that includes N (not in position 4) and avoids C, R, E. “SNAIL” fits: S (1), N (2), A (3), I (4), L (5). It satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 3.
- I is confirmed at position 4.
- N is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters C, R, E, S, L are not present at all.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ A I _. Including N at position 1 or 5 and avoiding the excluded letters. The word “AGAIN” fits:
- Positions: 1 A, 2 G, 3 A, 4 I, 5 N
- Contains A at the required third spot and I at the fourth.
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus “AGAIN” is a valid next guess.
