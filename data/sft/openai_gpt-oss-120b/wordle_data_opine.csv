### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess of a valid 5‑letter English word. I'll start with a common word that contains a mix of common letters and varied positions to gather useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good choice.

The feedback tells me that the secret word has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position, and it does not contain the letters C, R, or A anywhere. I need a new five‑letter word that fits the pattern ___NE and avoids C, R, A. “SHONE” fits: S H O N E, with N and E correctly placed, and the other letters are new possibilities.

We have pattern ____NE with N in position 4 and E in position 5. Excluded letters: C, R, A, S, H. The letter O is in the word but not in position 3, so O must be in position 1 or 2.
