### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- L and E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- T is in the word but not at position 4.

So the secret word starts with S and must contain A and T in different positions than previously guessed. A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3). T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

A word that satisfies these constraints and avoids L and E is **SATIN** (S‑A‑T‑I‑N):

- A moves to position 2 (allowed).

We know:

- A is in the word but not positions 2,3 (from two guesses) → A can be 4 or 5.
- T is in the word but not positions 3,4 → T can be 2 or 5.
Thus possibilities:
- T at 2 and A at 4 → pattern S T _ A _
- T at 2 and A at 5 → pattern S T _ _ A
- T at 5 and A at 4 → pattern S _ _ A T

A valid English word fitting the first pattern is **STRAW** (S‑T‑R‑A‑W), which uses allowed letters only. This will test the placements of T and A and introduce new letters R and W.

So the next guess is “STRAW”.

- T at 2 and A at 4 → pattern S T _ A _
- T at 2 and A at 5 → pattern S T _ _ A
- T at 5 and A at 4 → pattern S _ _ A T

A valid English word fitting the first pattern is **STRAW** (S‑T‑R‑A‑W), which uses allowed letters only. This will test the placements of T and A and introduce new letters R and W.

So the next guess is “STRAW”.

- Positions 1‑4 are confirmed: S T R A.
- Position 5 is still unknown.
- Letters ruled out: L, E, I, N, W (and any others previously marked x).
So the secret word is “STRA_”. Valid English words fitting this pattern and not using eliminated letters include **STRAP** and **STRAY**. I’ll try one of them.

We have confirmed the first four letters: S T R A. The fifth letter is still unknown. Letters that have been ruled out (marked x) are L, E, I, N, W, P. Therefore the remaining candidate letters for the final position must not be any of these. Common English words fitting the pattern ""STRA_"" are limited. ""STRAY"" uses Y, which hasn't been eliminated, and is a valid word. No other common word fits (e.g., ""STRAD"" is not a standard word). Hence the logical next guess is ""STRAY"".
