### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have established:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- Position 4 is L (✓).
- Letters G and P are not in the word.
- Letter O is in the word but not at position 4 (from GALOP dash on O).
Thus O must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word of pattern __ A L __ that includes O in one of those allowed spots and avoids all letters marked x: C,R,N,E,S,H,T,B,I,Y,G,P.

The word “KOALA” fits:
- K (allowed) at pos1,
- O (allowed) at pos2,
- A at pos3 (confirmed),
- L at pos4 (confirmed),
- A at pos5 (allowed, duplicate A not ruled out).

All letters are permissible, and O is placed at position 2, satisfying the requirement that O is present but not at position 4.
