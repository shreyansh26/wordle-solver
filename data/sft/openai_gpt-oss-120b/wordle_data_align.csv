### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain C, R, or E. It does contain A and N, but A is not in the 3rd position and N is not in the 4th position.  
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N in different positions, while avoiding C, R, and E, and introduces new letters to test further.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, E, B, L.
- Letters **in the word**: A and N.

Positions constraints:
- A is **not** in positions 2, 3, or 4 → A can only be in position 1 or 5.
- N is **not** in positions 3 or 4 → N can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both A and N, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the excluded letters.  
A good pattern is **A N _ _ _** (A in position 1, N in position 2). This satisfies the position rules, and we can fill the remaining three letters with new, untested letters.

The word **ANTSY** fits perfectly:
- A (position 1) ✔
- N (position 2) ✔
- Uses new letters T, S, Y to test more possibilities.
- Contains none of the forbidden letters C, R, E, B, L.

Thus “ANTSY” is an optimal next guess.

- Excluded letters (marked x) are: C, R, E, B, L, T, S, Y.
- We must choose three new letters for positions 2‑4 from the remaining alphabet (e.g., D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) avoiding any previously eliminated letters.

""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants. This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain C, R, or E. It does contain A and N, but A is not in the 3rd position and N is not in the 4th position.  
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N in different positions, while avoiding C, R, and E, and introduces new letters to test further.  
The word **BANAL** fits:  
- Contains A (positions 2 and 4, both allowed)  
- Contains N (position 3, allowed)  
- Introduces new letters B and L for testing  
- No C, R, or E.
Thus it’s a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: BANAL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) N(-) A(-) L(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, E, B, L.
- Letters **in the word**: A and N.

Positions constraints:
- A is **not** in positions 2, 3, or 4 → A can only be in position 1 or 5.
- N is **not** in positions 3 or 4 → N can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both A and N, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the excluded letters.  
A good pattern is **A N _ _ _** (A in position 1, N in position 2). This satisfies the position rules, and we can fill the remaining three letters with new, untested letters.

The word **ANTSY** fits perfectly:
- A (position 1) ✔
- N (position 2) ✔
- Uses new letters T, S, Y to test more possibilities.
- Contains none of the forbidden letters C, R, E, B, L.

Thus “ANTSY” is an optimal next guess.

Guess 2: BANAL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) N(-) A(-) L(-)
Guess 3: ANTSY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- Position 1 is A (confirmed by ANTSY).
- N is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 (all gave “-”). Therefore N must be at position 5.
- The secret word pattern is A _ _ _ N.
- Excluded letters (marked x) are: C, R, E, B, L, T, S, Y.
- We must choose three new letters for positions 2‑4 from the remaining alphabet (e.g., D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) avoiding any previously eliminated letters.

A common English word fitting A _ _ _ N with only unused letters is **AXION** (A‑X‑I‑O‑N). It uses new letters X, I, O, none of which have been ruled out, and satisfies the pattern A…N.

Thus the next logical guess is AXION.

We have confirmed letters and positions:
- A is correct at position 1.
- I is correct at position 3.
- N is correct at position 5.
- Letters C, R, E, B, L, T, S, Y, X, O are not in the word.

The pattern is **A _ I _ N**.  
We need a valid English word fitting this pattern while using only letters not yet ruled out for positions 2 and 4.  
A common word that fits the pattern is **ALIGN** (A L I G N).  
Although L was previously marked absent (x), guessing it again is permissible and will give us useful feedback about G at position 4 and confirm L’s status.
