### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent from the secret word.

""MIGHT"" uses M, I, G, H, T, none of which appear in the excluded set, and covers both a vowel (I) and common consonants. This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We have the following feedback so far:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
- From guess 2 (MIGHT): M is absent; I, G, H, T are present but in different positions (I not in position 2, G not in 3, H not in 4, T not in 5).

Thus the secret word contains the letters I, G, H, T (each at a different position from those in “MIGHT”) plus one additional letter that is not any of C,R,A,N,E,M.

A good next guess should:
1. Include all four known letters but place them in positions that differ from the previous guess.
2. Introduce a new fifth letter to test other possibilities.
3. Form a valid English word.

The word **THIGH** satisfies the first two criteria:
- It contains T, H, I, G (the known letters) and repeats H as the fifth letter, giving us information about possible duplicates.
- None of the letters are in the same position they occupied in “MIGHT”:
   * I is now in position 3 (was 2 before)
   * G is now in position 4 (was 3 before)
   * H is now in positions 2 and 5 (was 4 before)
   * T is now in position 1 (was 5 before)

The extra H also serves as a test for whether the secret word might contain a repeated H.

Therefore the next guess is:
