### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular starter word that covers a consonant (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good chance of hitting some letters of the secret word.

We know the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and cannot contain C, R, or N anywhere. We need a new 5‑letter word matching the pattern __A_E with none of the excluded letters. “GLAZE” fits: G L A Z E, uses new letters and respects the known positions.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from GLAZE feedback where L was at position 2 and got a ""-"" indicating wrong spot).

Thus the pattern is _ _ A _ E with L either at position 1 or 4. 
A word that fits and respects all exclusions (C, R, N, G, Z) is **SH ALE**: S H A L E.
- S and H are new letters not previously ruled out.
- L is at position 4, satisfying the L‑in‑word clue.
- The word matches the known positions A (3) and E (5).

Therefore, the next guess should be SHALE.
