### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- E is confirmed at position 4.
- R is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 2, so possible positions 3 or 5.
- L is in the word but cannot be at position 3, so possible positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, O, S.

We need a 5‑letter word with E in the fourth slot, containing both R and L in allowed positions, and using none of the excluded letters.

The word **BLUER** fits:
- Pattern B L U E R → E at position 4.
- L at position 2 (allowed) and not position 3.
- R at position 5 (allowed, not 1 or 2).
- New letters B and U are not excluded.

  * E is correct at position 4 (E✓).
  * R is correct at position 5 (R✓).
  * L is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so the only remaining slot is position 1. Therefore L must be the first letter.
- The current pattern is **L _ _ E R**.

We need a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses letters that haven’t been excluded. Possible candidates include **LIVER**, **LIKER**, **LIFER**, etc. Choosing **LIVER** introduces two new letters (I and V) which will give us more information.

Thus the next guess is “LIVER”.

We have confirmed letters and positions:

- V is correct at position 3 (V✓).
- E is correct at position 4 (E✓).
- R is correct at position 5 (R✓).
The only unknown is the second letter. Feedback shows I (position 2 in LIVER) is not in the word, and O (position 2 in ROLES) and A (position 2 in CRANE) are also excluded. Possible English words matching the pattern L _ V E R are:
- LEVER (second letter E, a valid word and allowed)
- LOVER (second letter O, but O is excluded)
- LAVER (second letter A, but A is excluded)
