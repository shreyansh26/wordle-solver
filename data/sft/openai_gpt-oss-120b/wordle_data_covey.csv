### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have deduced the following from the feedback:

- Position 2: O (✓) – correct.
- Position 3: D was guessed and got x, so D is not in the word.
- Position 4: E (✓) – correct.
- Position 5: The second C got a “-”, meaning C is in the word but not in position 5. Since we already have C at position 1, the word contains only one C.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **C O _ E _**.

Letters that are known NOT to be in the word: R, A, N, L, F, T, D (from earlier guesses).  
We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not excluded, trying to form a valid English word.

A viable candidate is **C O P E S** (“COPES”).  
- P and S have not been ruled out.  
- The word matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “COPES”.

Letters that are known NOT to be in the word: R, A, N, L, F, T, D (from earlier guesses).  
We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not excluded, trying to form a valid English word.

A viable candidate is **C O P E S** (“COPES”).  
- P and S have not been ruled out.  
- The word matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “COPES”.

We have determined the secret word pattern is C O _ E _. Letters known not in the word: R, A, N, L, F, T, D, P, S. Position 5 cannot be C (second C was marked “-”). Position 4 is E, position 2 is O, position 1 is C.

We need a common English 5‑letter word matching C O _ E _. Possible candidates using only unused letters are limited. “COKEY” (C O K E Y) fits the pattern, uses K and Y which have not been ruled out, and is a valid Scrabble word. “COZ EY” (C O Z E Y) also fits, but “cokey” seems slightly more common in word lists.

Thus I will guess **COKEY**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
