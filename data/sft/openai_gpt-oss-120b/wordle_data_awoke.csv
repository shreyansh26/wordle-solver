### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: A (green)
- Position 5: E (green)

Eliminated letters from all previous guesses: C, R, N, T, B, L, M, U, S, Z, I, D.

So the remaining possible letters for positions 2–4 are: F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y (and any not yet tried).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form A _ _ _ E using only those allowed letters. A common English word that fits is **AWOKE** (A‑W‑O‑K‑E). None of W, O, K have been ruled out, and the word respects the known pattern.

Thus the next guess should be “AWOKE”.
