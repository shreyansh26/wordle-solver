### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:

- E is correct and in the 5th position.

So the next guess should have E at the end and avoid C, R, A, N. A good candidate is “SLIDE” (S L I D E), which introduces new letters S, L, I, D while keeping E in the correct spot.

We have the following information from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L, D are not in the secret word.
- Letter E is correct and fixed at position 5.
- Letter I is in the word but not at position 3 (it was in position 3 in the guess “SLIDE”).

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **I** somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and must avoid all eliminated letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep **E** at the end.
2. Place **I** in a different position than 3 (preferably position 2 or 4, or even both to test).
3. Introduce new, untested letters.

The word **“PIXIE”** satisfies these constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I at positions 2 and 4 (both are allowed).
- Introduces new letters P and X, which haven’t been tested yet.
- Uses only letters that are not eliminated.

So the next guess will be “PIXIE”.

We have deduced the following from feedback:
- E is correct in position 5.
- I is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, so I must be in position 1.
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L, D, P, X are not in the word.
Thus the secret word pattern is I _ _ _ E, using only letters that have not been eliminated.

A good common word that fits this pattern and introduces new letters is **IMBUE** (I‑M‑B‑U‑E). It keeps I at position 1 and E at position 5, and tests the new letters M, B, and U.

So the next guess will be IMBUE.
