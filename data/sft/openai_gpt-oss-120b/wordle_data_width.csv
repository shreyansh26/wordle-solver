### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- CRANE: all letters are not in the word.
- GHOST: G, O are not in the word; H and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (H is not in position 2, T is not in position 5).

Therefore the secret word must contain H and T, none of C,R,A,N,E,G,O,S, and H cannot be the 2nd letter while T cannot be the 5th letter.

We need a common 5‑letter word using only the allowed letters (including H and T).  
The word **PITHY** uses letters P, I, T, H, Y – all allowed, includes both H and T, and places them in positions 4 and 3 respectively, which satisfies the positional constraints.

- From PITHY: P and Y are not in the word; I is correct at position 2; T and H are in the word but still in wrong positions.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters I (fixed at position 2), H, and T.  
Positional restrictions:
- H cannot be in position 4 (it was guessed there in PITHY).
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (guessed there in GHOST and PITHY).

Allowed letters (excluding all that got an “x”) are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a real English word that:
- Has I as the second letter,
- Contains H and T,
- Places H not in position 4,
- Places T not in positions 3 or 5,
- Uses only allowed letters.

The word **FILTH** fits perfectly:
- F I L T H → I is in position 2,
- H is in position 5 (not 4),
- T is in position 4 (not 3 or 5),
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Therefore the next guess should be “FILTH”.

We have determined the fixed letters from feedback:
- I is correct at position 2.
- T is correct at position 4.
- H is correct at position 5.

All letters marked x are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, G, O, S, P, Y, F, L.  
Thus the remaining unknown letters (positions 1 and 3) must come from the unused alphabet.

The pattern is **_ I _ T H**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **WIDTH** (W I D T H).  
It respects all constraints: W and D have not been eliminated, and the known letters are in the correct spots.

Therefore the next guess should be “WIDTH”.
