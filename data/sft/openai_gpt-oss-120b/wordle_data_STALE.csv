### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving me useful information for the next steps.

We know the secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position, and does not contain C, R, or N anywhere. I need a common five‑letter word that fits the pattern __A_E and avoids those letters. “SLATE” (S L A T E) matches all constraints, so it’s a good next guess.

From the feedback:
- Positions: 1 S (✓), 2 L (-), 3 A (✓), 4 T (-), 5 E (✓).
- L is in the word but not at position 2, and cannot be at positions 1,3,5, so it must be at position 4.
- T is in the word but not at position 4, and cannot be at positions 1,3,5, so it must be at position 2.
