### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placement. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two vowels and three consonants. This should give informative feedback for the next steps.

The feedback from the first guess tells us:
- A is correct at position 3.
- N is in the word but not at position 4, so N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word with A in the third slot and N in a different slot (1, 2, or 5). Choosing a common word that avoids C, R, and E will give useful new information.

The word **STAIN** fits:
- Pattern __A_N (A third, N fifth).
- Uses only new letters S, T, I (none are eliminated).
- Provides a good mix of consonants and a vowel.

Thus STAIN is a solid next guess.
