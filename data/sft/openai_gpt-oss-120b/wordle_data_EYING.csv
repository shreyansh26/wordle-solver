### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game, I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels. This will give us useful information about which letters are present and their positions. “CRANE” is a good initial guess.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A are not in the word (x).
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

Thus the secret word must have N as the 4th letter, include an E somewhere in positions 1‑3, and must not contain C, R, or A.

Looking for a common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints, “SPEND” works:
- Pattern: S P E N D → N is in position 4.
- E is in position 3 (not position 5).
- No prohibited letters (C, R, A) appear.

So the next guess is “SPEND”.
