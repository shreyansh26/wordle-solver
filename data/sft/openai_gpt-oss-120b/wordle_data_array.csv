### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a good opening guess that covers common letters and vowel positions. ""CRANE"" uses three frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), giving a balanced chance to learn about the secret word’s letters and positions.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _ with an A somewhere other than position 3 (positions 1, 4, or 5). I’ll choose a word that places A at position 1 to satisfy that condition and introduces new letters to test. “ARROW” fits: A at position 1, R at position 2 (confirmed), and adds O and W for new information. No excluded letters appear.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: R is correct at position 2. A is in the word but not position 3. C, N, E are not in the word.
- From ARROW: A is correct at position 1, R correct at positions 2 and 3. O and W are not in the word.
