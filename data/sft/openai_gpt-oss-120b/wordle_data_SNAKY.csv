### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Letters ruled out: C, R, E, L, I, F, U.

Thus the secret word has pattern S N A _ _. We need a common word fitting this pattern without using any excluded letters. “SNAGS” (S‑N‑A‑G‑S) meets all conditions: G has not been eliminated, and repeating S at the end is allowed. This guess will test the new letter G and also check if a second S is possible.

We have confirmed:

- Position 3: A (✓)

Feedback from guess 4 (SNAGS):
- G is not in the word (x).
- The S at position 5 is marked “-”, meaning S exists elsewhere (we already have S at position 1), so position 5 cannot be S.

Thus the pattern is **S N A _ _** with the following restrictions:
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, E, L, I, F, U, G.
- Position 4 and 5 must be letters not in the excluded set.
- Position 5 cannot be S.

A common word fitting **S N A _ _** and respecting these constraints is **SNATH** (S N A T H). Both T and H have not been eliminated, and the word is valid English.

Therefore the next guess should be “SNATH”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 3 must be **A** (A is correct).
- The letter **N** is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters **C, R, E** are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the third slot, containing N somewhere other than the fourth slot, and avoiding C, R, E.

The word **SLAIN** fits:
- Pattern: S L A I N → A is in position 3.
- N is in position 5 (not position 4).
- No C, R, or E appear.

Thus ""SLAIN"" is a valid next guess.
