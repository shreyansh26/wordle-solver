### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common consonants and vowels, to gather useful information for the next guesses.  
A good opening guess is “CRANE”, which contains three frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give a solid spread of feedback.

We know the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N in any position. To maximize information, we should pick a 5‑letter word that:
- Has E in the fifth position.
- Uses common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., L, O, U, S, T, I, D, etc.).
- Avoids C, R, A, N entirely.

“LOUSE” fits: it ends with E, contains none of the excluded letters, and introduces L, O, U, S for testing.
