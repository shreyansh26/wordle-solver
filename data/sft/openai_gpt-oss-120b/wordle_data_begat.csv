### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, or N. It DOES contain the letters A and E, but A cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5 (their positions in the guess ""CRANE"").

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in other positions and avoids C, R, N. A good candidate is **ADEPT**:

- From Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, N are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 3. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (ADEPT): D, P are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 1. E is in the word but not in position 3. T is correct in position 5.

Combining these:
- The secret word contains **A**, **E**, and **T**.
- **T** is fixed at position 5.
- **A** cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2 or 4.
- **E** cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.

- V A L E T → T is at position 5.
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters appear.

- T is confirmed at position 5.
- A cannot be in positions 1,2,3 → must be in position 4.

Thus the word pattern is either **E ? ? A T** or **? E ? A T**.

We need a valid English word avoiding the excluded letters (C, R, N, D, P, V, L) and using allowed letters.
