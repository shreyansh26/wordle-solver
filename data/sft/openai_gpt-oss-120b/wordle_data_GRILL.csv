### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowel positions, to maximize the information I’ll get. “SLATE” is a good starter: it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two different vowels (A, E). This should help reveal which letters are present and roughly where they belong.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain S, A, T, E. It DOES contain the letter L, but not in the second position (since L was marked “-” when it was second). Therefore our next guess should:
- Include the letter L, placed somewhere other than the second slot.
- Avoid the letters S, A, T, E.
- Introduce new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **GUILD**:
- L is in the fourth position, satisfying the “wrong position” clue.
- All other letters (G, U, I, D) are new and do not violate the excluded letters.
Thus this guess will give us fresh information about the remaining letters.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Position 4: L (✓)
- Letters S, A, T, E, U, D are not in the word.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 2 (already satisfied by L being in position 4).
Thus the secret word pattern is **G _ I L _**.

We need to choose a common 5‑letter word that fits this pattern and uses letters we haven’t ruled out for positions 2 and 5. A suitable candidate is **GRILL** (G‑R‑I‑L‑L). It keeps the known correct letters in place, tests a new letter R for position 2, and checks whether a second L appears in position 5.
