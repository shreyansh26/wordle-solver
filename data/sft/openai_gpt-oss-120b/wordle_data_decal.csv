### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and T are not in the word.
- L, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
  * L is not in position 2.
  * A is not in position 3.
  * E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes L, A, and E in different positions, avoids S and T, and places the other two letters arbitrarily. “EARLY” satisfies all these constraints:
- Contains E (position 1), A (position 2), L (position 4), and no S or T.
- L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.
Thus it’s a valid next guess.

We have these constraints from feedback:
- Letters S, T, R, Y are not in the word.
- Letters L, A, E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.
  * L cannot be in positions 2 (SLATE) or 4 (EARLY) → allowed: 1,3,5
  * A cannot be in positions 3 (SLATE) or 2 (EARLY) → allowed: 1,4,5
  * E cannot be in positions 5 (SLATE) or 1 (EARLY) → allowed: 2,3,4
- We need a 5‑letter word containing L, A, E in allowed spots, with the remaining two letters not being S, T, R, or Y.

A word that satisfies all of this is **DECAL**:
- D E C A L → positions: E at 2 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed).
- It introduces D and C, which have not been ruled out.

Thus DECAL is a valid next guess.
