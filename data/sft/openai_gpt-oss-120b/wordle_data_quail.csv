1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- L is in the word but not in position 2, so it can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

The word **LOATH** fits perfectly:

We have confirmed letters:
- Position1 Q (from QUALM feedback ✓)
- Position2 U (✓)
- Position3 A (✓)
- L is in the word but not in position1,2,4 (from previous – feedback). Thus L must be at position5.
Therefore the secret word pattern is Q U A _ L.

Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, N, E, G, S, O, T, H, M. Also letters guessed that are not excluded: L (must be pos5). Remaining possible letters for position4 are any not excluded and not already used: B, D, F, I, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word fitting Q U A _ L is ""QUAIL"" (Q U A I L). I hasn't been excluded, and the pattern matches.
Thus the next guess should be QUAIL.
