### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- One S is correct at position 4.
- The second S is present but not at position 5, meaning there is at least another S elsewhere (position 1 or 2).

- Position 4 is S (from GLASS and SMASH).
- Position 5 is H (from SMASH).
- There are two S's in the word, one at position 4 and the other must be at position 2 (since position 1 was ruled out by SMASH and position 5 was ruled out by GLASS). So position 2 = S.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, G, L, M, plus any other letters seen with an “x”.
Thus the word pattern is _ S A S H.

A common English word fitting that pattern is **SWASH** (W S A S H).

So the next guess should be SWASH.

We have the following feedback:

1. **CRANE** → C, R, N, E are not in the word (x). A is correct at position 3 (✓).
2. **GLASS** → G, L are not in the word (x). A is ✓ at pos 3. S at pos 4 is ✓, the second S (pos 5) is present but not at pos 5 (‑), meaning there is an S elsewhere.
3. **SMASH** → S at pos 1 is ‑ (S is in the word but not at pos 1). M is not in the word (x). A at pos 3 ✓, S at pos 4 ✓, H at pos 5 ✓.  
   → From this we know the word contains an S at position 4, A at position 3, H at position 5, and there is **no** S at position 1.
4. **SWASH** → S at pos 1 is still ‑ (S not at pos 1). W at pos 2 is ✓, A at pos 3 ✓, S at pos 4 ✓, H at pos 5 ✓.

Thus the current confirmed pattern is:

- Position 2 = **W**
- Position 3 = **A**
- Position 4 = **S**
- Position 5 = **H**
- Position 1 is not **S** and cannot be any letters already marked x (C, R, N, E, G, L, M).

A common English word that fits the pattern **_WASH** and respects all exclusions is **AWASH** (A W A S H). It places an A at position 1 (which hasn’t been disproven) and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore the next logical guess is **AWASH**.
