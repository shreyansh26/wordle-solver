### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular starting word in Wordle because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E. This should give me a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word does NOT contain C, R, N, or E. It does contain the vowel A, but not in the third position (as in CRANE). So the new guess must avoid the forbidden letters and place A in a different spot. Choosing a word with common letters will give more information. “GLOAT” uses A in the fourth position, includes no prohibited letters, and introduces new letters G, L, O, T for testing.

From the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, G, T.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A and O are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (A not in positions 3 or 4; O not in position 3).
Thus A can be in position 1 or 5, and O can be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
A valid word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters is **ALLOY** (A L L O Y), where A is at position 1, L is correctly at position 2, O is at position 4 (different from its previous guess), and Y is a new letter to test.
