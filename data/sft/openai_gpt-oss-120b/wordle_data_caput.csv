### Game Rules:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter guess starting with C, containing A in a different slot (2, 4, or 5), and avoiding R, N, E. “CAVIL” fits: C at position 1, A at position 2, and it uses only letters not ruled out.

We have:
- Position 1: C is correct.
- Position 2: A is correct.
- Letters V, I, L, R, N, E are confirmed not in the word.

We need a word starting with “CA” and using three new letters for positions 3‑5 to gather more information. A good candidate is **CAPUT**, which introduces P, U, and T—none of which have been ruled out yet. This will tell us which of these letters, if any, belong in the secret word and their positions.
