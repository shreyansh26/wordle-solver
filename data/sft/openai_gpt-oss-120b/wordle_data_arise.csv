2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it uses frequently occurring letters (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- The letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (‑). So A can be at position 1 or 4.
- C and N are not in the word (x).

We need a 5‑letter word matching the pattern _ R _ _ E, containing A at position 1 or 4, and avoiding C and N.

The word **ARISE** fits:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- R is at position 2 (✓).
- I and S are new letters (no conflict).
- E is at position 5 (✓).

Thus ""ARISE"" is a valid next guess.
