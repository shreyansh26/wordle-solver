### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1: C (green from COILY)
- Position 2: O (green from WORLD and COILY)
- Position 4: L (green from WORLD and COILY)
- Position 5: Y (green from NOBLY and COILY)

Thus the word is C O _ L Y.  
All letters that have been marked absent (x) are: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, N, B, I, plus any others from prior guesses.  
The only remaining viable letters for position 3 are those not yet excluded. A strong candidate that uses only known letters is **COLLY** (C O L L Y), placing L at the third spot. This fits the pattern and introduces no new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a word pattern **_ O _ L _** with remaining letters not yet excluded.

Good candidate words fitting the pattern and using new letters are:
- **NOBLY** (N O B L Y) – introduces N, B, Y.
- **COILY** (C O I L Y) – introduces C, I, Y.

Choosing a word with three new letters gives the most information. I’ll guess **NOBLY**.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ O _ L Y.

To test the remaining unknown letters (positions 1 and 3) while using only letters not yet eliminated, a good candidate is **COILY**:
- C and I are new letters, giving more information.
- It respects the known positions (O at 2, L at 4, Y at 5).
- It contains none of the excluded letters.

Therefore, the next guess is COILY.

We have determined the confirmed positions from prior feedback:
- Position 1: C (green)
- Position 2: O (green)
- Position 4: L (green)
- Position 5: Y (green)

The only unknown slot is position 3. The feedback from the last guess (COLLY) gave a yellow on the L at position 3, which suggests that the letter L is in the word but not at position 3. Since we already have an L at position 4, the duplicate L in the guess may simply be marked yellow even though there isn’t a second L; therefore we cannot rely on that to place another L.

We need a valid English word fitting the pattern C O _ L Y, using only letters that have not been ruled out (excluded letters: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, N, B, I). The word **COYLY** matches the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and is a common word.

Thus the next guess should be “COYLY”.
