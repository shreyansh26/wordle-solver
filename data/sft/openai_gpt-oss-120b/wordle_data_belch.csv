### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the first feedback:
- S, A, T are not in the secret word.
- L and E are in the word, but not in the positions they occupied in “SLATE” (L not 2nd, E not 5th).

So the next guess should:
- Exclude S, A, T.
- Include L and E, placed in different positions than 2 and 5 respectively.
- Use three other letters that could still be possible.

A good candidate is “CRUEL”: it contains L (position 5) and E (position 4), both different from their previous spots, and introduces C, R, U which are still unknown.

We have the following information from feedback:

  * C – not in position 1 (from CRUEL).

Thus the secret word must contain **C, L, E** plus two other letters that are not the excluded ones. The placement constraints are:
