### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:

We need a 5‑letter word of the form C A _ _ E with new letters for positions 3 and 4 that are not excluded. “CACHE” fits this pattern (C A C H E) and introduces H, which hasn’t been ruled out. It also repeats C, which is allowed because we have no feedback saying C cannot appear elsewhere.
Thus “CACHE” is a logical next guess.

- The second C in the guess “CACHE” got a yellow, meaning there is another C elsewhere in the word, but not at position 3.

A plausible word matching this pattern is **CARCE**. If that is not a dictionary entry, the next guess would test another third‑letter option, but we’ll try “CARCE” first.

- Position 5 = E (green)
- Letters R, N, B, L, H are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **C A _ _ E**.  
We need to test possible letters for positions 3 and 4. Choosing a word that introduces new letters will give us more information. “CAUSE” (C A U S E) adds the previously untested letters **U** and **S**, allowing us to determine which of them belong in the word and at which positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
