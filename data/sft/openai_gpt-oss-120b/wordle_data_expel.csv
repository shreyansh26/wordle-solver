### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback so far:
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, T, S, I, V, D are NOT in the secret word.
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.
- Letter E is in the word, not in positions 2,5, and now confirmed at position 4 (E ✓).

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E _.  
L must be at position 2 or 5.  
We need a word with E at the fourth spot, containing L in one of those allowed positions, and using only letters that have not been ruled out.

A suitable five‑letter word is **GLUEY**:
- G L U E Y fits the pattern G L U E Y.
- L is at position 2 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (confirmed).
- The other letters (G, U, Y) are still unknown, giving us new information.

So the next guess should be “GLUEY”.

We have deduced:

- L is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (each gave “-”). Since position 4 is E, the only remaining spot for L is position 5, so the word ends with **L**.
- Excluded letters (x) are: C, R, A, N, B, T, S, I, V, D, G, U, Y.
- Remaining possible letters for the first three positions are: F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, W, X, Z (and L/E which are already placed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

- Position 4 is definitely **E** – from LIVED (E ✓) and WHEEL (E ✓).
- The letter **L** cannot be in positions 1‑3 (all gave “-”), so L is fixed at position 5.
- The letter **E** appears elsewhere besides position 4, because in WHEEL the third‑position E received “-”. Therefore the word contains **at least two E's**, one at position 4 and another at either position 1 or 2 (position 3 is ruled out).
- Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, A, N, B, T, S, I, V, D, G, U, Y, W, H, and also from earlier guesses: L is not at positions 1‑3, but that's already handled.

Remaining usable letters for the unknown spots are: **E, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, X, Z** (and possibly others not yet tried like L already placed).

We need a common English word of the form **_ _ _ E L** that also contains another **E** in position 1 or 2, and uses only allowed letters.
