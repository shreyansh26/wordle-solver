We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: G (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Positions 4 letters that have been tried and are NOT correct: V (from GRAVE) and T (from GRATE). Those letters are ruled out.

Excluded letters overall: C, N, D, P, V, T.

We need a common 5‑letter word of the form G R A _ E using none of the excluded letters. The only common English word that fits is **GRAZE** (fourth letter Z, which hasn’t been ruled out). So we’ll guess GRAZE.
