### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, A, N, U, L are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 4.
- R is correct at position 5.
- The first R in the guess “RULER” was marked “-”, meaning there is another R elsewhere (since the R at position 5 already satisfies the one R in the answer). Therefore the secret word contains **two R’s**: one at position 5 and another not at position 1.

Thus the pattern is: _ R? _ E R or _ _ R E R (the second R can be in position 2 or 3).

We need a valid 5‑letter word using only allowed letters, fitting the pattern and placing a second R in position 2 or 3. “DRIER” (D R I E R) satisfies:
- R at position 2 and position 5,
- E at position 4,
- No forbidden letters (C, A, N, U, L) are used.

So the next guess will be “DRIER”.

- The first R in the guess “RULER” was marked “-”, meaning there is another R elsewhere (since the R at position 5 already satisfies the one R in the answer). Therefore the secret word contains **two R’s**: one at position 5 and another not at position 1.

Thus the pattern is: _ R? _ E R or _ _ R E R (the second R can be in position 2 or 3).

We need a valid 5‑letter word using only allowed letters, fitting the pattern and placing a second R in position 2 or 3. “DRIER” (D R I E R) satisfies:
- R at position 2 and position 5,
- E at position 4,
- No forbidden letters (C, A, N, U, L) are used.

So the next guess will be “DRIER”.

- The secret word has R at position 5 and E at position 4.
- There is another R in the word, but it cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Since position 2 was marked “-” in guess 3, the second R must be at position 3.
- Letters C, A, N, U, L, D, I are not in the word.
Thus the pattern is: _ _ R E R, with the second letter not R and using only allowed letters.

A valid English word fitting this pattern and avoiding the eliminated letters is **SORER** (S O R E R).

- Position 5 is R (R ✓ at guess 2).
- No other Rs are present (the dash at other positions only indicates the single R is elsewhere, i.e., at position 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
