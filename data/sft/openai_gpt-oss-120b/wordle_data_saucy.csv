# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess we learned:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (‑).

So the secret pattern is: S _ _ _ _.  
A must be in one of the remaining spots (2, 4, or 5).  
We need a new word that keeps S in the first slot, avoids L, T, E, and puts A somewhere other than the third position while also testing new letters.

A good candidate is **SAXON**:
- Starts with S (keeps the known correct letter).
- Places A in position 2 (testing if that’s the correct spot).
- Introduces three new letters X, O, N to gather more information.
- Uses no forbidden letters L, T, or E.

Thus the next guess will be “SAXON”.

We have confirmed:

- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
- Positions 3 and 4 are unknown letters, not S (the extra S’s were marked “-” because the only S is at position 1).

Letters that are ruled out so far: L, T, E, X, O, N, P, I, D.  
We need a new 5‑letter word of the form **SA??Y** that introduces fresh letters while respecting the known constraints.

A valid English word that fits is **SAURY** (a type of fish). It uses new letters U and R, keeping the known correct letters in place.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess we learned:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (‑).

So the secret pattern is: S _ _ _ _.  
A must be in one of the remaining spots (2, 4, or 5).  
We need a new word that keeps S in the first slot, avoids L, T, E, and puts A somewhere other than the third position while also testing new letters.

A good candidate is **SAXON**:
- Starts with S (keeps the known correct letter).
- Places A in position 2 (testing if that’s the correct spot).
- Introduces three new letters X, O, N to gather more information.
- Uses no forbidden letters L, T, or E.

Thus the next guess will be “SAXON”.
