### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new guess that:
1. Keeps I at position 3.
2. Places E at a possible position (choosing position 1 gives us a clear test).
3. Introduces several new, untested letters to learn about the remaining slots.

The word **EDIFY** satisfies these criteria:
- E is at position 1 (allowed).
- I remains at position 3.
- New letters D, F, and Y are tested, none of which have been eliminated yet.

Thus “EDIFY” is a strong next guess.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We re‑evaluated the feedback symbols: “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, while “x” means it is not in the word.  

From the previous clues we have:
- I is correct at position 3 (✓).
- E is correct at position 4 (✓) (it was not allowed at positions 1, 2, 5).
- D is correct at position 5 (✓) (it was not allowed at position 2).

Letters known to be in the word but not placed yet:
- H (from HEIST, H(-) → H is in the word, not at position 1).
- S (from HEIST, S(-) → S is in the word, not at position 4).

All other letters have been ruled out (C,R,A,N,T,F,Y,P,L,O,X and the eliminated positions for the remaining letters).

Thus the unknown letters must occupy positions 1 and 2, and they must be H and S in some order.  
Constraints:
- H cannot be in position 1 → H must be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied) and can be in position 1 or 2, but position 2 is taken by H, so S must be in position 1.

The only word fitting the pattern **S H I E D** is **SHIED**.

Therefore the next (and final) guess is “SHIED”.
