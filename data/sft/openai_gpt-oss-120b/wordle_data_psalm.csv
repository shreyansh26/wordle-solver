### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels to gather information. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in Wordle-like games because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This should give me a good distribution of feedback for the secret word.

We know the secret word has A in the third position, and letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word with A as the third letter and without any of the excluded letters. A good candidate is ""PLAIT"" (P‑L‑A‑I‑T), which satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to test.

We have:
- From CRANE: A is correct at position 3; C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- From PLAIT: P is correct at position 1; A again correct at position 3; L is in the word but not at position 2; I and T are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
1 = P
2 ≠ L, ≠ C,R,N,E,I,T (any other letter)
3 = A
4 or 5 = L (since L isn’t at position 2)
Other letters cannot be C,R,N,E,I,T.

We need a real 5‑letter word matching P _ A L _. “PSALM” fits:
- P at 1 (✓)
- S at 2 (allowed)
- A at 3 (✓)
- L at 4 (L not at 2, good)
- M at 5 (allowed)

All letters are permissible, and the word is common enough.

So the next guess should be “PSALM”.
