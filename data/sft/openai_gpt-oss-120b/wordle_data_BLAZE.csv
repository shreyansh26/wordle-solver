### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Positions known: 2nd letter L (✓), 3rd letter A (✓), 5th letter E (✓).
- Letters ruled out: C, R, N, S, T, plus previously excluded letters from first guess (C, R, N) and second guess (S, T). So far the secret word must fit the pattern _ L A _ E and cannot contain any of those excluded letters.
- Choose a word matching the pattern while avoiding the excluded letters. Possible options include “BLADE”, “FLAME”, etc.
- “BLADE” uses letters B, L, A, D, E; none of those are excluded, and it fits the pattern perfectly.
Thus the next guess will be **BLADE**.

We have determined the secret word pattern is B L A _ E, with the fourth letter unknown. Excluded letters from previous guesses are C, R, N, S, T, D, M. The fourth position cannot be D or M and cannot be any of the excluded letters. Viable English words fitting the pattern are ""BLAZE"" (fourth letter Z) and ""BLAKE"" (fourth letter K). ""BLAZE"" is a common noun/adjective and is likely allowed. I will guess ""BLAZE"".
