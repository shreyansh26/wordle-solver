# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain the letters C, R, A, or N anywhere. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (it was 5th in CRANE, so it must be elsewhere). For the next guess we should include E in a different position and try other common letters while avoiding the disallowed ones.

We have confirmed that the secret word contains E and I. Feedback shows:
- E is present but not in positions 1,2,4,5 → E must be in position 3.
- I is present and was confirmed correct at position 4.
All letters marked with (x) are not in the word: C,R,A,N,L,M,S,D,T,Y,Q,U,P.  
Thus the pattern is __EI_ and the remaining possible letters for the unknown spots are among {B,F,G,H,J,K,O,V,W,X,Z}.  

To gather more information we need a guess that keeps E in position 3 and I in position 4, while introducing new candidate letters for the other slots. A valid English word that fits this pattern is **SHEIK** (variant of “sheikh”). It places E and I where we think they belong and tests H, K and the first‑position letter S (which we already suspect is absent, but the guess will confirm).

So the next guess will be:
