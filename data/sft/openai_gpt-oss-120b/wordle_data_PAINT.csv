### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ A I N T. The letter at position 1 cannot be S (eliminated), cannot be T (eliminated at position 1), and cannot be any of the previously eliminated letters C, R, E, L, O, G. The remaining common possibilities include F, H, M, P, etc. ""FAINT"" is a common word fitting the pattern and uses a new letter F that hasn't been ruled out. This will confirm the correct first letter.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, and E are not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word has the form _ _ _ N _. A must be in position 1, 2 or 5. To test new letters while respecting these constraints, I’ll choose a word that keeps N in the fourth slot, places A elsewhere, and avoids the rejected letters C, R, and E. “ALONG” fits: A is at position 1, N stays at position 4, and it introduces L, O, G for further clues.

Guess 2: ALONG -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) N(✓) G(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, E, L, O, G.
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3, so it must be in position 2 or 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern:
- Position 4 = N
- Position 2 or 5 = A

We need a valid 5‑letter word that includes N at the fourth slot and A in either the second or fifth slot, while avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **TAINT** satisfies these constraints:
- T A I N T → N is fourth, A is second.
- It uses none of the eliminated letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be “TAINT”.
