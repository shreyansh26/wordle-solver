### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on the first guess:

- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (it was 3rd in “CRANE”).

We need a new five‑letter guess that includes A in a different spot and avoids C, R, N, E. A good candidate is “BALMY” (B A L M Y), which satisfies those constraints and tests new letters.

We know from previous feedback:

We need a new guess that includes A in one of those allowed spots and avoids all eliminated letters. Choosing a word with A in the first position lets us test many new letters. “AUDIO” fits: A is first, and the other letters U, D, I, O have not been tried yet and are not among the eliminated set.
Thus “AUDIO” is a valid next guess.
