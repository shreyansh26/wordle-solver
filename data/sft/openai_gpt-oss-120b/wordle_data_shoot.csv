### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:

- Position 3: O (✓)
- T is in the word but not positions 2,4 (from both guesses); therefore T must be position 5.
Thus the pattern is S _ O _ T.

Letters known not in the word: L, A, E, R, M.
We need letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not among those and fit a real word.

The word “SCOUT” fits the pattern S C O U T, using new letters C and U which have not been ruled out. It’s a common 5‑letter word, so it’s a good next guess.
