### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that only the letter **R** is in the secret word, and it is not in the second position. All other letters from the first guess (C, A, N, E) are not in the word. I need a new 5‑letter word that:

- Contains the letter R, but not in position 2.
- Uses none of the excluded letters C, A, N, E.

A good candidate is **BIRTH**:
- It includes R in the third position.
- The other letters (B, I, T, H) have not been ruled out yet.

Thus, BIRTH is a valid next guess.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters C, A, N, E, I, H are not in the word.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- The letter B is in the word, but not in position 1.
- The letter T is in the word, but not in position 4.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing R, B, and T that respects those position limits.  

The word **ROBOT** fits all constraints:
- Contains R, O, B, O, T.
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- B is at position 3 (not position 1).
- T is at position 5 (not position 4).
- No excluded letters are used.

Thus ROBOT is a valid next guess.
