### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (correct).
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

We need a new guess that keeps S at the first position, includes L and T (in positions other than the forbidden ones), and avoids A and E. A good choice is **SPILT**:
- S stays in position 1.
- It contains L (at position 4, which is allowed) and T (at position 5, also allowed).
- Introduces new letters P and I to gather more information.
- No A or E are present.

Thus the next guess will be “SPILT”.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is in the word but not position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not position 4.
- E is in the word but not position 5.

From the second guess SPILT we learned:
- S is correct in position 1.
- P is correct in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- L is correct in position 4.
- T is correct in position 5.

Thus the only unknown letter is the third position, and it must be one of the letters we know are present but not yet placed: E (since E is present from the first guess). Placing E in position 3 gives the word **SPELT**, which satisfies all earlier clues.

So the next guess should be SPELT.
