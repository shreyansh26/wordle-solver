### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 5 = E (✓ from both guesses)
- Position 3 = N (✓ from second guess)
Forbidden letters (not in the word): C, R, A, L, U, G, and also letters marked x in guess2: L, U, G (already included). So we must avoid C,R,A,L,U,G.

We need a word pattern __N_E with no forbidden letters. “DENSE” fits: D(1) E(2) N(3) S(4) E(5). It uses only allowed letters (D, E, N, S) and repeats E which is already known at position 5 and allowed at position 2.
