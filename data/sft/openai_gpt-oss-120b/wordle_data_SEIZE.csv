### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Eliminated letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, G, L, D, P, T, K, V.

Thus the secret word has the pattern **S _ I _ E**.

We need a word that uses only letters not eliminated for positions 2 and 4. Possible new letters include B, F, H, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, and also we can reuse E (since E is already known to be in the word).

The word **SEIZE** fits the pattern:
- S (position 1) – matches confirmed S.
- E (position 2) – a new letter, not eliminated.
- I (position 3) – matches confirmed I.
- Z (position 4) – a new letter, not eliminated.
- E (position 5) – matches confirmed E.

No letters in SEIZE have been ruled out, so it is a valid next guess.
