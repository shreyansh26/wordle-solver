### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is **L** (✓ both times).
- Position 3 is **A** (✓ both times).
- Position 4 is **S** (✓ in the second guess).
- The letter **S** also appears elsewhere in the word (the second S got “-”), but it cannot be in position 1 (first guess gave “-” for S at position 1) nor in position 5 (the “-” on the second S tells us it’s not correct there).
- Letters **T**, **E**, **G** are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ L A S _ with the restrictions that the first and last letters are not **S**, **T**, **E**, or **G**.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **CLASS** (C‑L‑A‑S‑S). It respects all constraints:
- C is not prohibited.
- L and A are fixed.
- S is correctly placed at position 4.
- The extra S at position 5 yields the “-” feedback we already saw.

Thus “CLASS” is a logical next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is **L** (✓ both times).
- Position 3 is **A** (✓ both times).
- Position 4 is **S** (✓ in the second guess).
- The letter **S** also appears elsewhere in the word (the second S got “-”), but it cannot be in position 1 (first guess gave “-” for S at position 1) nor in position 5 (the “-” on the second S tells us it’s not correct there).
- Letters **T**, **E**, **G** are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ L A S _ with the restrictions that the first and last letters are not **S**, **T**, **E**, or **G**.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **CLASS** (C‑L‑A‑S‑S). It respects all constraints:
- C is not prohibited.
- L and A are fixed.
- S is correctly placed at position 4.
- The extra S at position 5 yields the “-” feedback we already saw.

Thus “CLASS” is a logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
