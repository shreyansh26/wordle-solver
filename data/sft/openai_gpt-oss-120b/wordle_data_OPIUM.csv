### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and varied positions to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter in such word games because it contains frequent letters (C, R, A, N, E) and spreads them across the word. I'll use that as my first guess.

We know that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. For the next guess we should choose a word that contains only new letters, avoiding those five. Picking a word with common letters that we haven’t tested will give us maximal information. “SLIMY” uses five fresh letters (S, L, I, M, Y) and is a valid English word, so it’s a good next guess.

We have feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N,E are all not in the word.
- Guess 2 (SLIMY): I is correct in position 3; M is in the word but not in position 4; S,L,Y are not in the word.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains I at the third position.
- Contains M somewhere other than the fourth position.
- Excludes the letters C, R, A, N, E, S, L, Y.

We need a new guess that keeps I at position 3, includes fresh letters, and ideally tests the position of M. However, finding a common English word with I third and M in a non‑fourth slot is difficult. Instead, we can use a word that respects all known exclusions and keeps I fixed, while introducing several new high‑frequency letters to gather more information. “THIGH” uses only allowed letters (T, H, G) and retains I at the third slot, providing a good test set for the remaining unknown letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “THIGH”.

We have the following information from past feedback:

- Letter **I** is correct and fixed in the 3rd position.
- Letter **M** is in the word but not in the 4th position (from the dash on the 4th spot of “SLIMY”).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _.  
It must contain **M** somewhere other than position 4, and all other letters must come from the remaining allowed set {B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, I}.

A word that satisfies these constraints, keeps I in the third slot, includes M (not in position 4), and uses only allowed letters is **UVIUM** (U V I U M). This word will tell us whether M is indeed in the 5th position and will test the new letters U and V.

Thus the next guess should be:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N,E are all not in the word.
- Guess 2 (SLIMY): I is correct in position 3; M is in the word but not in position 4; S,L,Y are not in the word.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains I at the third position.
- Contains M somewhere other than the fourth position.
- Excludes the letters C, R, A, N, E, S, L, Y.

We need a new guess that keeps I at position 3, includes fresh letters, and ideally tests the position of M. However, finding a common English word with I third and M in a non‑fourth slot is difficult. Instead, we can use a word that respects all known exclusions and keeps I fixed, while introducing several new high‑frequency letters to gather more information. “THIGH” uses only allowed letters (T, H, G) and retains I at the third slot, providing a good test set for the remaining unknown letters.

Therefore the next guess will be “THIGH”.

- Letters **C, R, A, N, E, S, L, Y, T, H, G** are not in the secret word.
- Letter **I** is correct and fixed in the 3rd position.
- Letter **M** is in the word but not in the 4th position (from the dash on the 4th spot of “SLIMY”).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _.  
It must contain **M** somewhere other than position 4, and all other letters must come from the remaining allowed set {B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, I}.

A word that satisfies these constraints, keeps I in the third slot, includes M (not in position 4), and uses only allowed letters is **UVIUM** (U V I U M). This word will tell us whether M is indeed in the 5th position and will test the new letters U and V.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
