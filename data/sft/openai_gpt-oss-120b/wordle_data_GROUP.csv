### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- R in position 2 (✓)
- O in position 3 (✓)
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (‑ on position 1 means wrong spot)
- X and Y are not in the word.
Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, E, F, S, T, B, I, L, X, Y.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ R O _ _. P must appear in position 4 or 5. A common word fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **GROUP** (G R O U P), where P is in position 5, satisfying the “‑” feedback for P at position 1.
