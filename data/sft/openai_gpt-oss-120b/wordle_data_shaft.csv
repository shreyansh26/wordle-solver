### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to gather information about the secret word. “CRANE” includes two frequent consonants (C, R) and two common vowels (A, E) plus N, which often appears in five‑letter words. This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Position 1 is S (confirmed from SWAMP).
- Position 3 is A (confirmed from CRANE and SWAMP).
- Letters C, R, N, E, G, L, W, M, P are not in the word.
- S is not in positions 4 or 5 (from GLASS feedback), so only S at position 1.
Thus the pattern is S _ A _ _. Remaining letters must avoid the eliminated set.
A good candidate that fits is ""SHAKY"": S (pos1), H (pos2), A (pos3), K (pos4), Y (pos5). None of H, K, Y have been ruled out.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)

Eliminated letters from all feedback: C, R, N, E, G, L, W, M, P, K, Y (all marked x).  
Thus remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5 cannot be any of those.

We need a common English word that fits the pattern S H A _ _. Candidates:
- SHARD (needs R – eliminated)
- SHAPE (needs P, E – eliminated)
- SHALL (needs L – eliminated)
- SHADE (needs D, E – E eliminated)
- SHARK (needs R, K – both eliminated)
- SHAVE (needs V, E – E eliminated)
- SHAFT (needs F, T – both not eliminated)

SHAFT fits all constraints and uses only new letters F and T, which have not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess is SHAFT.
