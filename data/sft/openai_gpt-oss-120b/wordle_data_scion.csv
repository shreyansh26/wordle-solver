### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common, information‑rich five‑letter word.  
A good opening guess uses a mix of common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate many possibilities.  
“CRANE” contains two of the most frequent letters (C, R, N) and both primary vowels (A, E), which will give useful feedback about vowel presence and placement as well as consonant positions.

We know from the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes C and N in different positions, and introduces other letters to test possibilities while avoiding R, A, and E.  
""LUNCH"" places C at position 4 (different from position 1) and N at position 3 (different from position 4). It also brings in L, U, and H for further information. This fits all constraints.

Thus the next guess will be ""LUNCH"".

We have determined that the secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in certain positions:
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 4, so it can be 2, 3, or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4, so it can be 1, 2, or 5.
All other letters eliminated so far are R, A, E, L, U, H.

We need a five‑letter word that includes C and N in allowed spots and introduces new letters to test.  
The word **SCION** fits:
- C is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- New letters S, I, O have not been tested yet and are not ruled out.
Thus it’s a good next guess.
