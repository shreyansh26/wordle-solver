### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback: C, R, N are not in the word. E is correct in position 5. A is in the word but not in position 3.  
So the secret word ends with **E**, contains an **A** somewhere other than the third slot, and does not contain C, R, or N.

From previous feedback:
- E is confirmed at position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, F, L.
- Letters that must be present: A (not in positions 2 or 3), B (not in position 3).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ _ E, with A allowed only in positions 1 or 4, and B allowed in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).  

Choose a word that respects these constraints while introducing new letters for testing. “ABIDE” fits:
- A at position 1 (valid),
- B at position 2 (valid),
- I and D are new letters,
- E at position 5 (already known).

So the next guess will be “ABIDE”.
