### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5. Letters C, R, and N are not present anywhere. We need a five‑letter word matching the pattern __A_E with no C,R,N. “BLADE” fits: B L A D E, satisfies the known positions and avoids the excluded letters. It will give us more information about the remaining letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: D (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the secret word matches pattern _ L A D E. The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""GLADE"". The letter G hasn't been tried and is not among the excluded letters (C, R, N, B). So we guess GLADE.
