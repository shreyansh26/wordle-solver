### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have two previous guesses:

   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. RINGO → R(-) I(x) N(-) G(x) O(x)
   - I, G, O are not in the word.
   - R is also not in position 1 (since it got “-” at position 1).
   - N is not in position 3 (got “-” at position 3).

Combining:
- Letters excluded: C, A, E, I, G, O.
- Required letters: R and N.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2; it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 3, 4; it must be in 1, 2, or 5.

We need a new word containing R and N in allowed spots, avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **SPURN** fits:
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- Contains only allowed letters S, P, U, R, N.

Thus it will give fresh information about the remaining three letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RINGO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) N(-) G(x) O(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two previous guesses:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - C, A, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. RINGO → R(-) I(x) N(-) G(x) O(x)
   - I, G, O are not in the word.
   - R is also not in position 1 (since it got “-” at position 1).
   - N is not in position 3 (got “-” at position 3).

Combining:
- Letters excluded: C, A, E, I, G, O.
- Required letters: R and N.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2; it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 3, 4; it must be in 1, 2, or 5.

We need a new word containing R and N in allowed spots, avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **SPURN** fits:
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- Contains only allowed letters S, P, U, R, N.

Thus it will give fresh information about the remaining three letters.

<guess>SPURN</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RINGO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) N(-) G(x) O(-)
Guess 3: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) U(x) R(✓) N(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have deduced the following from the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 4 is R (✓).
- N is in the word but not in positions 3,4,5; therefore N must be in position 2.
Thus the pattern is **S N _ R _**.

All letters C, A, E, I, G, O, P, U have been ruled out.  
The remaining unknown letters (positions 3 and 5) must come from the unused alphabet.

A good next guess should keep the confirmed letters (S, N, R) in their correct spots and test two new letters. “SNARK” fits the pattern S‑N‑A‑R‑K, keeping S, N, and R fixed while introducing A and K for further information.

Therefore, I will guess **SNARK**.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 4: R (✓)

Remaining unknown positions are 3 and 5.  
All letters that have received an “x” are excluded: A, C, E, G, I, K, O, P, U.  
We need a real 5‑letter word of the form **S N _ R _** using only the remaining letters.  
A common candidate fitting this pattern is **SNORT**. Even though O was previously marked “x”, testing it now will clarify whether that elimination was correct.

Thus the next guess is SNORT.
