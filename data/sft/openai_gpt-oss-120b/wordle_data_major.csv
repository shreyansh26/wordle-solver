### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

Thus:
- Position 2 is definitely **A**.
- **R** must be somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, B, I, D.
- Remaining unknown letters can be tested.

A good next guess should keep A at position 2, place R at a new position, and introduce fresh letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “MARGO” fits:
- A is second.
- R is third (new position).
- New letters M, G, O have not been tested yet.
