### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Given feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are not in the word.

We need a new guess that keeps C at the start, avoids A, N, E, and places R somewhere other than the second slot. Choose a common word that satisfies these constraints, such as ""CURLY"" (C at position 1, R at position 3, and uses new letters U, L, Y).

We know:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters A, N, E, U, L, Y are not in the word.
We need a new word starting with C, placing R at position 4 or 5, and introducing fresh letters to test possibilities.

A good candidate: **CHIRP**
- C stays in position 1.
- R is at position 4 (allowed).
- Introduces H, I, P, none of which have been ruled out.
