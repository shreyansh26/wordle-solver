### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- CRANE: C, R, A are not in the word; N is present but not in position 4; E is correct at position 5.
- SNIPE: S, I, P are not in the word; N is correct at position 2; E is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ N _ _ E, with N fixed at position 2 and E at position 5. Excluded letters are C, R, A, S, I, P. We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting the pattern and avoiding those letters.

The word **GNOME** fits perfectly: G N O M E.
- N is in position 2.
- E is in position 5.
- Letters G, O, M are not among the excluded set.
So GNOME is a logical next guess.
