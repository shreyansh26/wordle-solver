### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from prior feedback:

- Letters marked x (not in the word): C, R, A, N, B, S, T, M, D.
- Letters marked - (in the word, wrong position): E, L, O.

Positional constraints:
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 2.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → L can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in position 2 → O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **HELLO**:
- Position 1 = H (new test letter, not ruled out)
- Position 2 = E (allowed for E)
- Position 3 = L (allowed for L)
- Position 4 = L (allowed for L)
- Position 5 = O (allowed for O)

No excluded letters appear, and the placement respects all known position restrictions. This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while confirming the positions of E, L, and O.
