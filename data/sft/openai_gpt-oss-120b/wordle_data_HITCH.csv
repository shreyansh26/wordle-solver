### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to give useful information for the next guesses.

Guess 2: SCOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) U(x) T(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from feedback:
- C is in the secret word, but not in position 1 (from CRANE) nor position 2 (from SCOUT). So C can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- T is in the secret word, but not in position 5 (from SCOUT). So T can be in positions 1‑4.
- Letters eliminated: R, A, N, E, S, O, U (they are not in the word).

We need a new guess that includes both C and T in positions we haven’t tried for them, and three other letters not yet eliminated.  
A good candidate is **THICK**:
- T is placed at position 1 (new spot, not position 5).
- C is placed at position 4 (new spot, not positions 1 or 2).
- The remaining letters H, I, K have not been tested and are not among the eliminated letters.

Thus the guess satisfies all constraints and will give us new information.

We need a 5‑letter word that places C at the 4th spot and includes T, H, and I in allowed positions, with the remaining letter being something not yet ruled out.

The word **DITCH** fits:
- D (unknown, not eliminated)

- T at position 3 (allowed, T not at 1 or 5)
- C at position 4 (confirmed)

All constraints are satisfied, and it introduces a new letter D for further information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
