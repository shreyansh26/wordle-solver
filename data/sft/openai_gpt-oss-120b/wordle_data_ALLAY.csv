### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial guess that is a common 5‑letter English word, ensuring it contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a popular starter choice in word‑guessing games because it includes frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E). I will submit this as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the secret word must contain A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll choose a common word that places A in a new spot and introduces new letters to test. “BALMY” puts A in position 2 and uses B, L, M, Y, none of which have been ruled out.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  → Letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.  
  → A is in the word but not in position 3.

- Guess 2: BALMY → B(x), A(-), L(✓), M(x), Y(✓)  
  → B, M are not in the word.  
  → L is correct at position 3.  
  → Y is correct at position 5.  
  → A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know it isn’t in position 3).

Thus the secret word must be of the form **_ _ L _ Y**, with an **A** somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, 5).  
All letters C, R, N, E, B, M are ruled out.

A common 5‑letter word satisfying these constraints is **ALLAY**:
- Positions: A 1, L 2, L 3 (matches the known L at position 3), A 4, Y 5.
- It contains A (not at positions 2 or 3) and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore the next guess will be **ALLAY**.
