### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the next guess should contain the letter A in a different slot (1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll choose a word with several new letters to gather more information: “MALTS”. This places A in the 2nd position and introduces M, L, T, S as fresh candidates.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, M, L, T.
- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- The letter S is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5; S can be in positions 1‑4 (just not 5).

We need a new guess that includes A and S in allowed spots and introduces fresh letters to test.  
Choosing **SQUAD**:
- S is placed at position 1 (allowed).
- A is placed at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3).
- Introduces Q, U, D – letters we haven’t tested yet.
All other letters are from the allowed set (no C, R, N, E, M, L, T).

This guess will give us more information about the unknown letters while respecting the known positional constraints.
