### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle‑style games because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants. This should give me useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

All five letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) have been marked as not present in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out and includes a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. “SHOUT” contains S, H, O, U, T, none of which have been eliminated, so it’s a good candidate for the second guess.
