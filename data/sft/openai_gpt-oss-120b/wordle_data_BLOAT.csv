### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the secret word must contain the letter A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and cannot contain C, R, N, E. I’ll choose a new word that includes A in a different slot and introduces several fresh letters to gather more information. “GLOAT” places A in the 4th position and adds the unused letters G, L, O, T for testing.
