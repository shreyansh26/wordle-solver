### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E). This will give useful information about the presence and positions of several letters.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as not present in the secret word. The next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose another common five‑letter word that contains none of C, R, A, N, E. “SHOUT” uses S, H, O, U, T, all of which are still possible, so it’s a good next attempt.

We have fixed letters in positions 1-3: S (✓), H (✓), O (✓). Positions 4 and 5 are unknown, but letters U and T are confirmed absent. Also C, R, A, N, E are absent from earlier guess. So the secret word matches pattern S H O _ _. We need a common English word fitting this pattern without any disallowed letters (C,R,A,N,E,U,T). Candidates:
- SHOOK (adds O and K) – O is allowed, K not excluded.
- SHOAL (contains A → excluded)
- SHORE (contains R,E → excluded)
- SHOES (contains E → excluded)
- SHOVE (contains E → excluded)
- SHONE (contains N,E → excluded)

Thus ""SHOOK"" is the only viable common word. We'll guess that.
