### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A and E are in the word, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, N, and tries new letters to gather more information. “BLEAT” fits:
- B L E A T uses A (position 4) and E (position 3), both different from the forbidden spots.
- It introduces B, L, and T for further testing.
Thus “BLEAT” is a good next guess.
