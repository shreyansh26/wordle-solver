### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have feedback: S is correct at position 1. L, T, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore the secret word starts with S, contains an A somewhere other than the third spot, and must avoid the letters L, T, and E entirely. 

Looking for a common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints, “SCUBA” works:
- Starts with S.
- Has A at the last position (position 5), satisfying the “A not in position 3” rule.
- Uses letters C, U, B that have not been ruled out.
- Contains no L, T, or E.

Thus the next guess will be “SCUBA”.

- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: C is not in the word.
- Position 3: U is correct.
- Position 4: B is not in the word.
- Position 5: A is correct.

Earlier feedback eliminated L, T, and E entirely.

Thus the secret word must follow the pattern S _ U _ A, using none of the letters C, B, L, T, E. The remaining unknown letters can be any other alphabet letters not yet excluded.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **SAUNA** (S‑A‑U‑N‑A). It respects all constraints:
- Starts with S and ends with A.
- Has U in the third position.
- Uses A again in the second position (allowed, since A is only known to be not in position 3).
- Introduces new letters N (acceptable) and repeats A, both not ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be ""SAUNA"".
