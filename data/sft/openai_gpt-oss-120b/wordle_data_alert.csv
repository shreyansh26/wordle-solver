### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common, information‑rich five‑letter word. ""SLATE"" includes a mix of common consonants and vowels (S, L, A, T, E) and often yields useful feedback, so I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know:
- Position 2 is L (correct).
- Letters A, T, E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (positions 3,4,5 respectively).
- S is not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with L second, containing A, T, E elsewhere, respecting the position bans:
- A ≠ position 3 → can be 1,4,5
- T ≠ position 4 → can be 1,3,5
- E ≠ position 5 → can be 1,3,4

The word **BLEAT** (B L E A T) satisfies all:
- L is in position 2.
- Contains E (pos3, allowed), A (pos4, allowed), T (pos5, allowed).
- No S present.

Thus BLEAT is a valid next guess.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 2 is L (from both guesses).
- Position 3 is E (from second guess, exact ✓).
- Position 5 is T (from second guess, exact ✓).
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4; with positions 2,3,5 already taken, A must be at position 1.
- Letters S and B are not in the word.
- Position 4 is still unknown and cannot be A, L, E, T, S, or B.

The pattern is therefore **A L E _ T**. The common English word fitting this pattern is **ALERT**, with R in the fourth position, which hasn't been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be ALERT, which should solve the puzzle.
