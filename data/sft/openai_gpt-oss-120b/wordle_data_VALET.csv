### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game, I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. This will give me informative feedback for the next steps. “CRANE” is a good starter because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = A (✓ from MALES)
- Position 3 = L (✓ from MALES)
- Position 4 = E (✓ from MALES)

Letters known not to be in the word: C, R, N, M, S, plus any letters marked x elsewhere.

Thus the word looks like _ A L E _. The remaining unknown letters are positions 1 and 5. They must be letters not in the excluded set (C,R,N,M,S) and also not duplicate A, L, E unless the word has repeats (unlikely).

Possible common words fitting the pattern include “VALET” (V A L E T) and “BALED” (B A L E D). Both introduce new letters that will give us clear information about the first and last positions.

Choosing “VALET” provides two fresh letters (V and T) to test the unknown slots.
