### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two frequent vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the feedback that the secret word starts with C in the first position, R in the second, and ends with E. Letters A and N are not present anywhere. The pattern is therefore C R _ _ E. We need a common 5‑letter word that fits this pattern and does not use A or N. “CRUDE” fits: C‑R‑U‑D‑E, uses new letters U and D, and respects the known constraints.
