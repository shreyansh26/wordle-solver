### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that:
- R is correct and in the second position.
- Letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like _ R _ _ _. I need a new five‑letter word with R in the second slot and none of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E). A common option is “TRUST”, which fits the pattern and uses only new letters (T, U, S) that haven’t been ruled out yet.

We have confirmed:
- Position1 = P (✓ from PROWL and PRIOR)
- Position2 = R (✓ from all guesses)
- Position3 = I (✓ from PRIOR)
- Letter O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from PROWL and PRIOR). Therefore O must be in position 5.
- Position4 is still unknown; it cannot be any letters that have been marked x: C, A, N, E, T, U, S, W, L. It also cannot be O (already placed) or R (duplicate unless the secret contains a second R, but PRIOR showed R at pos5 as ‘-’, indicating the extra R belongs elsewhere, which could be position4, but a common English word fitting the pattern is *PRIMO* with M at position4).

The word **PRIMO** satisfies all constraints:
- P R I M O matches the known correct letters.
- O is at position 5, not at 3 or 4.
- M has not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be PRIMO.
