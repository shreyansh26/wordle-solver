### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C was in the word but not in position 1.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have **R** at the 2nd spot.
- Contain **C** somewhere in positions 3‑5.
- Contain **E** somewhere in positions 1‑4 (but not 5).
- Exclude the letters **A** and **N**.

A valid 5‑letter word that meets these constraints is **ERUCT** (E R U C T), which places E at position 1, R at position 2, and C at position 4, satisfying all the known conditions while introducing new letters U and T for further clues.
