### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

- E is in the word but not at position 5 → could be 1, 2, 4.
- Letters eliminated: R, N, S, L, and any other letters seen as “x”.

We need a word of the form __A__, containing C and E in allowable spots, and avoiding eliminated letters.  
The word **BEACH** fits:
- B E A C H → A is at position 3.
- C is at position 4 (allowed).
- E is at position 2 (allowed, not 5).
- Uses only new letters B and H, which haven’t been ruled out.

We have the following confirmed information:

- C is correct at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at positions 2, 5, and from the latest guess we see it must be at position 1 (since position 2 was E in BEACH and got a '-', and position 5 was ruled out earlier). So E is at position 1.
- Letters eliminated: R, N, S, L, B, H, and any other letters marked with “x”.

Thus the word pattern is **E _ A C _**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern, using only unused letters, is **EXACT** (E‑X‑A‑C‑T). It satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters X and T for further testing.
