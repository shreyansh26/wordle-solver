### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- The secret word contains the letters A, I, and at least two S's.
- Position 3 is definitely an S (✓ from VISAS).
- The second S is in the word but not in position 5 (‑ from VISAS) and also not in position 4 (‑ from ARISE). Therefore the other S must be in position 1 or 2.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (‑ from ARISE) or 4 (‑ from VISAS). So A can be in positions 2, 3, or 5, but position 3 is already S, leaving positions 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in positions 2 (‑ from VISAS) or 3 (‑ from ARISE). So I can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- The letters R, E, V are not in the word.

A valid English word that satisfies all these constraints is **OSSIA**:
- O at position 1 (unknown, allowed)
- S at position 2 (second S, wrong position, matches the “‑” feedback)
- S at position 3 (correct position, matches the “✓” feedback)
- I at position 4 (I is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, allowed)
- A at position 5 (A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, allowed)

We have deduced the following constraints from the feedback:

- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 → must be in position 2.
- Letter S is in the word and was marked correct at position 3 → S is at position 3.
- Letter I is in the word and was marked correct at position 4 → I is at position 4.
- Letters R, E, V, O have been marked as not in the word.
- The remaining positions (1 and 5) can be any letters not excluded, and they must form a valid English word.

The pattern is: _ A S I _. A common English word fitting this pattern is **BASIC** (B A S I C). None of the excluded letters appear, and all known letters are in the correct positions.

Thus the next logical guess is ""BASIC"".
