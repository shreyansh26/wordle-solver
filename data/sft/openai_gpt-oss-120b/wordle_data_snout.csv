### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

Thus the next guess must include N in a different position and avoid C, R, A, E. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints: **BUNTS** (N is in position 3, and none of the prohibited letters appear).

We have two guesses with feedback:

1. CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word (x). N is present but not in position 4 (-).
2. BUNTS: B is not in the word (x). U, N, T, S are present but not in the positions they appear in (all -).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters N, U, T, S plus one other letter (not C,R,A,E,B).  
Positional restrictions:
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions 1,2,5.
- U cannot be in position 2.
- T cannot be in position 4.
- S cannot be in position 5.
- No banned letters in any position.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **SNOUT**:
- Contains S, N, O, U, T (O is the unknown fifth letter, not banned).
- Positions: S1 (allowed), N2 (allowed), O3 (free), U4 (U not in pos2, OK), T5 (T not in pos4, OK).

Therefore the next guess should be SNOUT.
