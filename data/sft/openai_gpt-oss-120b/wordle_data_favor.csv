### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new word with A in the second slot, R in slot 4 or 5, and only using letters not yet ruled out. 
The word **MAJOR** fits: pattern M A J O R (A at 2, R at 5) and introduces new letters M, J, O which have not been eliminated.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 2 = A (confirmed by multiple guesses)
- Position 4 = O (confirmed by guess 4)
- Position 5 = R (confirmed by guess 4)

R cannot be in positions 1‑3, so it must be in position 5, which matches.

The remaining unknown positions are 1 and 3, forming the pattern _ A _ O R.

Eliminated letters (marked “x”) are: C, N, E, I, L, S, G, T, H, M, J, plus any others from earlier guesses. Letters still possible include F, V, D, K, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **FAVOR** (F A V O R), using the still‑allowed letters F and V.

Thus the next guess should be “FAVOR”.
