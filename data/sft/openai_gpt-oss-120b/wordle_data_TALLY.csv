### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but NOT in the third position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. For the next guess I’ll choose a word that:
- Includes A in a new position,
- Avoids the forbidden letters C, R, N, E,
- Introduces several new letters to gather more information.

“GLOAT” fits these criteria: it places A in position 4, and uses the new letters G, L, O, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.
