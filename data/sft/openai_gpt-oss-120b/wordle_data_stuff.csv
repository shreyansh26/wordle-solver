### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get good information about the secret word. “CRANE” includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should help identify letters and their positions early.

We have determined that the first three letters are S, T, U in exact positions from the feedback on ""STUDY"". The letters D and Y are not in the word. All previously guessed letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H, P, O) are also excluded. Therefore the secret word is of the form **STU??** where the fourth and fifth letters are not any of the excluded letters. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out is **STUFF** (adding two F’s, a letter we have not tested). This guess will confirm whether the remaining letters are F‑F.
