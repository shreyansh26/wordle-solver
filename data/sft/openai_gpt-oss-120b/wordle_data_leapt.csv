### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is correct at position 3.
- E is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Has A as the third letter.
- Includes E somewhere other than the last position.
- Does not contain C, R, or N.
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **LEAST** (L E A S T):
- A is in the required third position.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- No C, R, or N appear.
- It adds new letters L, S, and T for further clues.

Thus we’ll guess “LEAST”.
