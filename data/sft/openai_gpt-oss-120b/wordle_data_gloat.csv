### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells me that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. It does contain the letter A, but A is not in the third position. Therefore, I need to choose a new five‑letter word that includes A in a different slot (1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoids the disallowed letters C, R, N, E.

A good candidate is **VAULT**:
- Contains A at position 2 (different from position 3).
- Uses only letters V, A, U, L, T, none of which have been ruled out.
- Provides new letters to test (V, U, L, T).

Thus I will submit “VAULT” as the next guess.

- T is correct at position 5.
- A is in the word but not at positions 3 (CRANE) nor 2 (VAULT), so A must be at position 1 or 4.
- L is in the word but not at position 4 (VAULT), so L can be at positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, V, U (all marked “x”).

A word that fits all these constraints is **ALLOT**:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- L appears at positions 2 and 3 (both allowed, and not at 4).
- T is at position 5 (confirmed correct).
- No prohibited letters are used.

Thus the next guess should be “ALLOT”.

We have determined the exact positions of four letters:

- Position 2: L (confirmed by FLOAT)
- Position 3: O (confirmed by FLOAT)
- Position 4: A (confirmed by FLOAT)
- Position 5: T (confirmed by FLOAT)

The only unknown is the first letter. From all previous feedback, the letters that are ruled out for the word are: C, R, N, E, V, U, F, and also the letter A cannot be at position 1 (it is already at 4). The first position must be a letter that is not among the excluded set and that forms a valid English word with the pattern **_LOAT**.

Common five‑letter words fitting this pattern are:

- **BLOAT**
- **GLOAT**

Both use only allowed letters. Since we have two guesses left, we start with the more common of the two, **BLOAT**.

This guess will either solve the puzzle or, if incorrect, leave us with only one possible remaining word (**GLOAT**) for the final try.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
