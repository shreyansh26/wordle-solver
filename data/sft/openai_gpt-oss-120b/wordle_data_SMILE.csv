### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess: it includes a vowel (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N) that will give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the first guess ""crane"" that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all, and the letter E is correct and in the fifth position. Therefore the secret word has the form _ _ _ _ E, with none of the letters C,R,A,N appearing elsewhere. To gather more information I’ll choose a word that uses only new letters and ends with E. “GLOBE” fits: it introduces G, L, O, B and keeps E in the correct spot, while avoiding the excluded letters.

We have pattern ____E. From ""crane"": C,R,A,N are not in the word, E is correct at position5. From ""globe"": G, O, B are not in the word; L is in the word but not at position2; E confirmed at position5. So we need three more letters (besides L and E) that are not any of the excluded letters {C,R,A,N,G,O,B}. Choose a word ending with E, placing L in a position other than 2. ""SMILE"" fits: S, M, I are new letters, L is at position4, and E at position5.
