### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, W. N is known to be in the word but not in position 5 (since N was marked '-' at position 5 in the guess CROWN). Therefore N must be in positions 1‑4.

We need a new 5‑letter word containing N (not at the last slot) and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (plus N).

A good candidate is **UNZIP**:
- Contains N at position 2 (acceptable).
- Uses letters U, N, Z, I, P, all of which are still possible.
- Is a valid English word.

Thus we’ll guess UNZIP.

We have confirmed letters:
- I is correct at position 2 (from DINGY).
- N is correct at position 3 (from DINGY and earlier hints).
- Y is correct at position 5 (from DINGY).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ I N _ Y.

We need a valid English word fitting the pattern. A good candidate is **JINNY**, which uses J (still untested) and repeats N at position 4, allowing us to verify whether the word contains a second N.

Thus the next guess will be JINNY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
