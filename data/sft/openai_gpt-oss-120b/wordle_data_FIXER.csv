### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Positions known: I is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 4.
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (occupied by I) and not at position 4 (occupied by E). So R must be at position 3 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, T, S.
- All other letters are still possible.

We need a word of the form **_ I _ E _** that includes R at position 3 or 5 and avoids the excluded letters.  
A common English word satisfying this is **FIRED** (F I R E D): it places R at position 3, fits the known letters, and introduces new letters F and D for further clues.

Thus the next guess is:

Thus the word pattern is **F I _ E R**.

Letters known not to be in the word (marked x): C, A, N, T, S, D.

The remaining unknown third letter must be a letter not excluded yet. Common possibilities include B, L, V, etc.

A viable English word fitting the pattern is **FIBER** (F I B E R), introducing the new letter B for further information.

So the next guess will be ""FIBER"".

We have determined the exact known letters:

- Position 4: E (confirmed)
- Position 5: R (confirmed)

The third letter is still unknown, and must be a letter not ruled out by previous guesses (C, A, N, T, S, D, B are excluded). Viable common words fitting the pattern **F I _ E R** include:
- FIVER (V as the third letter)
- FILER (L as the third letter)
- FIFER (F as the third letter)

Choosing **FIVER** introduces a new letter V and tests one of the plausible options.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the pattern **F I _ E R** with confirmed letters at positions 1 (F), 2 (I), 4 (E), and 5 (R). The letters that are known NOT to be in the word are: C, A, N, T, S, D, B, V. The third position must be a letter not among those exclusions.

Possible valid English words fitting the pattern are:
- **FILER** (third letter L)
- **FIXER** (third letter X)

Both L and X are still allowed. “FIXER” introduces a new, previously unused letter X and is a common word, making it a good candidate for the next guess.
