### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess of a common 5‑letter English word. I'll pick ""trace"" as it contains a mix of common letters and provides a good spread of vowels and consonants for the first feedback.

We know C is correct at position 4, and T,R,A,E are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word with C in the fourth slot and none of the excluded letters. One candidate is **BUNCH** (B‑U‑N‑C‑H), which fits the pattern _ _ _ C _ and avoids T, R, A, E.

We have confirmed letters: position 2 = U, position 4 = C. Excluded letters are T,R,A,E,B,N,H. Need a 5‑letter word pattern _ U _ C _. “juicy” (J U I C Y) fits: U at 2, C at 4, and none of the excluded letters appear. It’s a common English word, so likely the secret word.
