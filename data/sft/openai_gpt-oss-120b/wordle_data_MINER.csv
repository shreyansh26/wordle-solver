### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- Letters R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”:
   * R cannot be in position 2.
   * N cannot be in position 4.
   * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Excludes C and A.
2. Includes R, N, and E, each placed in a different position from those in “CRANE”.
3. Adds two other letters to test more possibilities.

The word **UNDER** satisfies all constraints:
- No C or A.
- Contains R (position 5, not 2), N (position 2, not 4), and E (position 4, not 5).
- Introduces the new letters U and D for additional information.

Thus, the next guess will be “UNDER”.

We have the following confirmed information:

- E is correct at position 4.
- R is correct at position 5.
- N is in the word but cannot be at positions 2 or 4 (and cannot be at 5 because R is there). So N must be at position 1 or 3.

Thus the word pattern is either **N _ _ E R** or **_ _ N E R**.

A common English word that fits the second pattern is **TONER** (T‑O‑N‑E‑R):

- Introduces new letters T and O to test other possibilities.

This should give me a good spread of feedback for the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess:
- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- Letters R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”:
   * R cannot be in position 2.
   * N cannot be in position 4.
   * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Excludes C and A.
2. Includes R, N, and E, each placed in a different position from those in “CRANE”.
3. Adds two other letters to test more possibilities.

The word **UNDER** satisfies all constraints:
- No C or A.
- Contains R (position 5, not 2), N (position 2, not 4), and E (position 4, not 5).
- Introduces the new letters U and D for additional information.

Thus, the next guess will be “UNDER”.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information:
- Letters C, A, U, D are not in the secret word.
- E is correct at position 4.
- R is correct at position 5.
- N is in the word but cannot be at positions 2 or 4 (and cannot be at 5 because R is there). So N must be at position 1 or 3.

Thus the word pattern is either **N _ _ E R** or **_ _ N E R**.

A common English word that fits the second pattern is **TONER** (T‑O‑N‑E‑R):
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters T and O to test other possibilities.
- Uses the known correct letters E (pos 4) and R (pos 5).

This guess respects all constraints and gives us more information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
