### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE gave the following information:
- C, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and A in different positions from those ruled out, and avoids C, N, and E. 
Choosing “RAILS” places R at position 1 (good, not position 2) and A at position 2 (good, not position 3). It also introduces three new letters I, L, S to gather more information while respecting the constraints.

We have determined the known letters and positions:
- Position 1 = R (from RAILS ✓)
- Position 2 = A (from RAILS ✓)
- Letter S is in the word but not at position 5 (RAILS gave S - at pos5), so S must be at position 3 or 4.
Letters that are not in the word: C, N, E, I, L.

We need a word of the form R A _ _ _.  
Placing S at position 3 gives the pattern R A S _ _. A common word fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **RASPY** (R A S P Y). This respects all known constraints.
