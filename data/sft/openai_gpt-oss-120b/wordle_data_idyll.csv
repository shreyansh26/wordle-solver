### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- CRANE: all letters eliminated (C,R,A,N,E).
- GHOST: all eliminated (G,H,O,S,T).
- BUILD: B and U eliminated; I is in the word but wrong spot; L is correct at position 4; D is in the word but wrong spot.
- MIDLY: M eliminated; I still wrong spot; D still wrong spot; L correct at position 4; Y is in the word but wrong spot.

Thus the secret word contains the letters **L** (fixed at position 4), **I**, **D**, and **Y**.  
Restrictions from the “‑” marks:
* I cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1 or 5.  
* D cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions 1 or 2.  
* Y cannot be in position 5 (and position 4 is taken) → possible positions 1, 2, or 3.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **IDYLL**:
- I at 1 (allowed), D at 2 (allowed), Y at 3 (allowed), L at 4 (✓), L at 5 (no conflict).
All letters are permitted and no eliminated letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “IDYLL”.
