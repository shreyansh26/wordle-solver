### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed (C 1st, R 2nd, A 3rd). The letters N and E are not in the word at all.  
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C, R, A in different positions, avoids N and E, and adds two other plausible letters.  
The word **MARCH** fits: it contains A, R, C, places them in positions 2, 3, and 4 (different from the original spots), and introduces M and H, which we have no information about yet. It also contains no N or E.

We have the following information:

- From the first guess (CRANE): C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively. N and E are not in the word.
- From the second guess (MARCH): 
  * R is correct in position 3.
  * M, A, and C are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.
  * H is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **C, R, A, M** plus one other letter (not N, E, H).  
Positions we know:

- Position 3 = **R** (fixed).
- **C** cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2 or 5.
- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
- **M** cannot be in position 1 → possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **SCRAM**:

- S (new letter, allowed)
- C in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (correct)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- M in position 5 (allowed)

All letters fit the known placements and none of the excluded letters appear. Therefore “SCRAM” is a logical next guess.
