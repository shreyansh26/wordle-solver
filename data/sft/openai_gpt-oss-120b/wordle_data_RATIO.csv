### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess SLATE:
- S, L, E are not in the secret word.
- A and T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (A not 3rd, T not 4th).

So the secret word must contain A and T, placed elsewhere, and must avoid S, L, E. A good next guess should include A and T in new positions and use other common letters that are not ruled out. “BATCH” (B A T C H) fits: it includes A (now in position 2) and T (position 3), and introduces new letters B, C, H to test.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is correct at position 2.
- T is correct at position 3.
All other letters from previous guesses are ruled out: S, L, E, B, C, H.

So the secret word has pattern _ A T _ _. Positions 1,4,5 must be letters not in {S, L, E, B, C, H}. We need a new guess that uses new letters to gain information. Choosing a common word with A at 2 and T at 3 and three new letters is optimal. “RATIO” fits: R A T I O, introducing R, I, O (none have been tested yet). This will tell us which of those are in the secret word and their positions.
