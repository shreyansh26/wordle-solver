### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Eliminated letters: C, N, E, I, L, S, P, T, Y (from previous guesses).
- Remaining possible letters are among B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the second slot and R at position 5 (or 4). The word **FAVOR** fits:
- Pattern: F A V O R → A at position 2, R at position 5.
- Contains only new letters (F, V, O) that haven’t been ruled out.
Thus FAVOR will test the R‑position and introduce three fresh letters.

From the feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 2.
- O is confirmed at position 4.
- R is confirmed at position 5.
- P is present but not at position 1, so it must be at position 3.
- V is present but not at position 3, leaving position 1 for V.

Thus the word fits the pattern V A P O R, which satisfies all previous clues. The next guess should be this word.
