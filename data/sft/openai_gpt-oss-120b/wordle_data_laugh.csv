### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 2 must be **A** (A was correct in BALMY).
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 3 (L got a “-” in BALMY).
- Excluded letters from the two guesses: C, R, N, E, B, M, Y (all received “x”).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ A _ _ _. It must contain an **L** somewhere other than the 3rd spot, and cannot contain any of the excluded letters.

A common 5‑letter English word meeting those constraints is **JAILS**:
- J A I L S → A is in position 2,
- L is in position 4 (not position 3),
- No excluded letters appear.

This guess will test new letters J, I, and S while confirming the placement of L.

- Uses only allowed letters: F, A, T, A, L.
- Tests new letters F and T while confirming the location of L.

Thus the next guess should be “FATAL”.

We have:
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by two ✓ marks).
- Letter L is present but was marked “-” at positions 3, 4, 5, so L cannot be in those spots; it must be at position 1.
- Excluded letters (x) are C, R, N, E, B, M, Y, J, I, S, F, T.
- Remaining letters can be from the set {D, G, H, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, A, L}.
We need a common English word of the form **L A _ _ _** using only allowed letters.  
“LAUGH” (L A U G H) fits: L at position 1, A at position 2, and U, G, H are all allowed and have not been ruled out. It also respects that L is not at positions 3‑5.
Thus the next guess should be LAUGH.
