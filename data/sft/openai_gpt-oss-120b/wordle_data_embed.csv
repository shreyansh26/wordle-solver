### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain C, R, A, or N. The letter E is present but not in the 5th position. So we need a new 5‑letter word that avoids C, R, A, N and places E somewhere other than the last slot. “MOTEL” satisfies these constraints: it has no prohibited letters and puts E in the fourth position.

We have confirmed that letters C, R, A, N, M, O, T, L are not in the secret word (marked x). Letter E is present and, from the second guess, is correctly placed at position 4 (E got a ✓ at the fourth spot). Therefore the secret word must have the form ***E* with the fourth letter fixed as E, and cannot contain any of the excluded letters.

We need a new valid 5‑letter word that respects these constraints. “SWEEP” fits:
- Pattern S W E E P → fourth letter is E.
- None of its letters (S, W, P) are among the excluded ones.
- It introduces two new letters (S, W, P) and repeats E, which is allowed.

Thus “SWEEP” is a suitable next guess.

We know:

- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, O, T, L, S, W, P, plus any others marked x.
- We need a word with pattern _ M _ E _ (if M is at 2) or _ _ _ E M (if M at 5).

A word that fits the first pattern and uses only allowed letters is **EMBED**:
