### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have feedback from the first guess CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters C, A, N, and E (each at a different position from those guessed) and must not contain R. We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C, A, N, E plus one other letter, respecting the positional restrictions.

The word **DECAN** (D‑E‑C‑A‑N) satisfies all conditions:
- Contains C, A, N, E.
- Positions: D (1) is allowed, E (2) avoids position 5, C (3) avoids position 1, A (4) avoids position 3, N (5) avoids position 4.
- No R present.

Therefore, DECAN is a valid next guess.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 4 is A (✓ from DECAN).
- Position 5 is N (✓ from DECAN).
- C is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 3; it also cannot be in 4 or 5 (occupied), so C must be in position 2.
- E is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 5; thus E can be in position 1 or 3.
- D and R are not in the word.

The pattern is: _ C _ A N, with E occupying either the first or third slot. The word **OCEAN** fits perfectly (O C E A N), satisfying all known constraints and introducing a new letter O.

Thus the next guess should be OCEAN.
