### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess SLATE that the letters S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (the last position). Our next guess should therefore:
- Exclude S, L, A, T.
- Include E, placed somewhere other than the 5th slot.
- Introduce new letters to test more possibilities.

A suitable word is “COVER”: it contains E in the 4th position, and the other letters C, O, V, R have not been tested yet and do not conflict with the known exclusions.

From the first guess (SLATE) we learned that S, L, A, T are not in the word and that E is in the word but not in the last position.

The second guess (COVER) gave feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- O, V, E, R are all correct **and in the correct positions** (positions 2‑5).

Thus the secret word has the form ? O V E R, where the first letter is not C, S, L, A, or T. Possible common words fitting this pattern are HOVER, DOVER, MOVER, and ROVER. To determine which one it is, I’ll guess a word that keeps O V E R fixed and tests a new first letter.
