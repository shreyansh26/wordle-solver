I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these games because it includes the common letters C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

We know the secret word has R in the second position and A in the third position. Letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word that respects the known positions and avoids the excluded letters. A common choice is **BRAVO** (B‑R‑A‑V‑O), which fits the pattern and introduces new letters B, V, O for testing.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- Position 3 = A (✓)
- Position 1 = B (✓)
- Letters V, O, C, N, E are not in the word.
So the secret word fits the pattern **B R A _ _** with two unknown letters that are not V, O, C, N, E. Choose a common word that introduces new letters and respects the pattern. “BRAID” (B R A I D) fits and tests I and D.
