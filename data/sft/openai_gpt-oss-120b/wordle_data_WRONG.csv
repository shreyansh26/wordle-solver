### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequently occurring letters C, R, N, and the vowel A plus E. This should give me a solid base of feedback for subsequent guesses.

We know from the feedback that:
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 4.
- The letters C, A, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must follow the pattern: _ R _ N _.  
We need a valid English word that fits this pattern and avoids C, A, E. “BRING” matches perfectly:
- B R I N G
- R is in position 2, N is in position 4.
- It contains none of the excluded letters (C, A, E).

Thus “BRING” is a logical next guess.

Current pattern from feedback:

- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: G (correct)
- Positions 1 and 3 are unknown.
Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, E, B, I.
Thus we need a word of form _ R _ N G using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates include “WRONG” (W R O N G) and “PRONG” (P R O N G). Both fit the pattern and use only letters not ruled out. I’ll choose the more common word “WRONG”.
