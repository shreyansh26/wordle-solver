### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern from feedback: letters known:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letter R is in the word but not at position 2.
- Letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E, containing R in a position other than 2, and avoiding C, A, N. Choosing a word that also introduces new letters will give more information. “ROGUE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- R is at position 1 (acceptable).
- Introduces O, G, U, none of which have been ruled out yet.
Thus “ROGUE” is a good next guess.

From previous feedback:
- Position 5 is definitely **E**.
- **R** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3 or 4.
- **U** is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters **C, A, N, O, G** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in **E** that contains both **R** and **U**, places **R** in position 3 or 4, and places **U** somewhere other than position 4.  
The word **PUREE** fits:
- P U R E E → ends with E, has R at position 3, U at position 2, and uses only letters not ruled out.
Thus it will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all constraints.
