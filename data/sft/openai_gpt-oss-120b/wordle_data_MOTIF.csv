### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback: S, L, A, and E are not in the word. T is in the word but not in the 4th position. So the secret word must contain T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. I’ll pick a common word that includes T in a different spot and avoids the excluded letters. “POINT” has T at the 5th position and uses none of the eliminated letters.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, P, N, E.
- O is correct at position 2.
- T is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5, so it must be at position 1 or 3.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word with O in the second slot, containing both T and I, with T placed at position 1 or 3 and I not at position 3. The word **MOTIF** (M O T I F) satisfies all these conditions and avoids all eliminated letters.

Thus the next guess is MOTIF.
