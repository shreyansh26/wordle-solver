### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE, we know:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the third position.

Thus the secret word pattern is __A__ with no C,R,N,E anywhere. I need a new 5‑letter word that has A in the third slot and avoids using the excluded letters.

We have confirmed that the third letter is A.  
From KOALA we learned:
- L is in the word but not in position 4 → L must be in position 1, 2 or 5.
- There is at least one more A (the second A in KOALA got a “-”), so the word contains a second A that is not in position 5.

Therefore the secret word pattern is:
_ _ A _ _
with L in 1, 2, or 5 and a second A in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 5).

A common 5‑letter word satisfying these constraints is **AVAIL**:
- A is at positions 1 and 3 (giving the required second A).
- L is at position 5 (allowed for L).
- All letters (A, V, I, L) have not been ruled out.

This guess also tests two new letters, V and I.
