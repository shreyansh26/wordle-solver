### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed positions from previous feedback:

- R is correct at position 5 (R✓).

Letters known to be in the word (but not yet placed) are N, I, and E.
From the feedback:
- N was wrong at positions 2,4,5, so N must be at position 1.
- This gives the pattern N _ C _ R.
- The remaining slots (positions 2 and 4) must be filled with I and E in some order.

The word that fits this pattern is **NICER**:
N (pos1) – I (pos2) – C (pos3) – E (pos4) – R (pos5).

All letters satisfy the earlier clues, and none of the excluded letters (A, S, O, U) appear.
