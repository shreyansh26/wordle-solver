### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, M, P, H, B.
- Confirmed letters:
  * U is correct at position 2 (U✓).
  * R is correct at position 3 (R✓) and there is another R somewhere else (second R got “-” at position 4).
  * O is in the word but not at positions 2, 3, or 5 (got “-” each time it was guessed).

Thus the word must fit the pattern:
_ U R _ _  
with another R not in position 4, and O in either position 1 or 4 (but not 5).

A valid English word that satisfies all constraints is **FUROR**:
- Positions: F U R O R → U at 2, R at 3, second R at 5 (allowed), O at 4 (allowed).
- Uses only letters not eliminated (F, O, R are still possible).

Therefore the next guess should be “FUROR”.
