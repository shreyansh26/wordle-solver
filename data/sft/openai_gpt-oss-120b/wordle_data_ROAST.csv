### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- A is correct at position 3.
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that keeps A in the third slot, avoids C, N, E, and preferably tests new letters while respecting the R clue. A good candidate is **GLASS** (G L A S S). It keeps A in place, introduces G, L, and S, and contains no prohibited letters.

We know:
- A is correct at position 3.
- S is correct at position 4.
- R is in the word but not at position 2, so it can be at position 1 or 5.
- Letters C, G, L, N, E are not in the word.

We need a word of the form _ _ A S _. To include the mandatory R without placing it at position 2, the simplest option is to put R at the first position. “ROAST” fits perfectly:
- R at position 1 (R is allowed, not at 2)
- O at position 2 (new letter, not prohibited)
- A at position 3 (confirmed)
- S at position 4 (confirmed)
- T at position 5 (new letter)

Thus “ROAST” respects all known constraints and introduces two new letters (O, T) for further information.
