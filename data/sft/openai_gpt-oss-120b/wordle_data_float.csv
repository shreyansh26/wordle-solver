### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells us that the letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter A is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore our next guess must:
- Include the letter A, but place it in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Exclude C, R, N, and E.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **BALMY**:
- It contains A (in position 2, satisfying the “wrong position” clue).
- The other letters B, L, M, Y are all new and not among the excluded letters.

Thus, BALMY is a valid next guess.
