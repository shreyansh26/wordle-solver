### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, M, O, N.
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.
- L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Thus the pattern is _ E _ _ _. L must occupy one of the remaining spots except position 1. A good candidate that fits these constraints and uses only new letters is **BELCH** (B E L C H). It places L at position 3, respects the known placement of E, and introduces only letters we haven’t ruled out.
