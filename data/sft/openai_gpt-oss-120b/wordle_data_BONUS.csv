### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4. For the next guess we should include N in a different position and test several new letters while avoiding the letters we already know are absent.

  - U is not in position 1 (from UNZIP).

Thus N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5; U can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).  
We need a valid 5‑letter word that contains both N and U, respects those position constraints, and avoids the eliminated letters.  

""NUTTY"" fits:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- U in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses only new letters T and Y, which have not been ruled out.
Hence, ""NUTTY"" is a good next guess.

- Letters not in the word (x): C, R, A, E, Z, I, P, T, Y.
- Letters in the word but misplaced (-): N and U.
- Position constraints:
  * N cannot be in positions 1 (from NUTTY), 2 (from UNZIP), or 4 (from CRANE). So N must be in position 3 or 5.
  * U cannot be in positions 1 (from UNZIP) or 2 (from NUTTY). So U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- We need a valid 5‑letter English word containing both N and U, respecting those position limits, and using only letters that have not been ruled out.

The word **GLUON** satisfies all conditions:
- Contains N (position 5) and U (position 3).
- N is not in positions 1, 2, 4 and U is not in positions 1, 2.
- The other letters G, L, O have not been excluded.

Thus GLUON is a good next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, A, E, Z, I, P, T, Y, G, L.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced (marked -): N, U, O.

Position constraints:
- N is not in positions 1,2,4 → N can be in 3 or 5.
- U is not in positions 1,2,3 → U can be in 4 or 5.
- O is not in position 4 → O can be in 1,2,3,5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **BONUS**:
- B O N U S
- Positions: O is in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), U in position 4 (allowed).
- B and S are letters we have no information about yet and are not excluded.

Thus BONUS is a valid next guess.
