### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a valid English word of five letters that starts with S and uses only allowed letters. “SKIMP” fits: S K I M P uses only allowed letters and is a common word.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 1 is S (correct).
- Letters K, M, P, Q, U, D, C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, H are not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, so I must be in position 2 or 5.

The remaining possible letters are B, F, G, I, J, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A valid English word that fits the pattern S I _ _ _ (with I at position 2) and uses only these letters is **SISSY** (S I S S Y). This word respects all known constraints and introduces the new letter Y for testing.

Thus the next guess should be “SISSY”.
