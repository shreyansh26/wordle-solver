### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common vowel‑rich five‑letter word that gives good information about possible letters and their positions. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter because it contains two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should provide a solid baseline for the first feedback.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- Letter E is correct and in the 5th position.

So the secret word ends with **E** and must avoid C, R, A, N. Choose a common word fitting those constraints. “SLIDE” meets all criteria (S, L, I, D are not excluded, and it ends with E). This will test several new letters.

We have determined that the only confirmed letter is E at position 5. All other letters from the previous guesses (C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D) are not in the secret word. Therefore the secret word must be a 5‑letter word ending in E and using only the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. A common word that fits these constraints is **QUOTE** (Q U O T E). This introduces new letters Q, U, O, T while keeping the known E at the end.
