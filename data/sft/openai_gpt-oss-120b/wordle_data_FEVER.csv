### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 4 is definitely **E** (✓ from guess 2 and 3).
- Position 5 is definitely **R** (✓ from guess 3).
- The secret word contains only the letters **E** and **R** from our previous guesses; all other letters guessed (C, A, N, O, B, S, T, I, M) are ruled out.
- The letter **R** cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (it was “-” in guess 1 at position 2 and “-” in guess 2 at position 1). Since we have R at position 5, the remaining unknown positions are 1‑3 and must be filled with letters not yet excluded.
Thus the pattern is ___ER, using only letters not in the excluded set {A, B, C, I, M, N, O, S, T}. Good candidates are words that introduce new letters and keep the known E and R in place.

A strong choice is **GLUER**:
- Fits pattern G L U E R.
- Introduces three fresh letters (G, L, U) to gather more information.
- Uses known E at position 4 and R at position 5.

So the next guess will be “GLUER”.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A strong choice is **GLUER**:
- Fits pattern G L U E R.
- Introduces three fresh letters (G, L, U) to gather more information.
- Uses known E at position 4 and R at position 5.

So the next guess will be “GLUER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
