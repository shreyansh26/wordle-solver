### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements, which will give useful information for the next steps. “CRANE” is a popular starting word in word‑guessing games because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowel pair A and E. This should reveal a good amount about the secret word’s letters and their positions.

We know from the first feedback:

- N is not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than in “CRANE”. Thus:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in new positions, avoids C and N, and introduces some new letters to gather more information.  
The word **RAVEL** satisfies these constraints:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2 in CRANE).
- A is at position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is at position 4 (different from position 5).
- V and L are new letters, and the word contains no C or N.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than in “CRANE”. Thus:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in new positions, avoids C and N, and introduces some new letters to gather more information.  
The word **RAVEL** satisfies these constraints:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2 in CRANE).
- A is at position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is at position 4 (different from position 5).
- V and L are new letters, and the word contains no C or N.

Thus “RAVEL” is a valid next guess.

- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1,2,3.

Letters that are definitely not in the word: C, N, V, L.

We need a new word that places R, A, and E in allowed slots and introduces two new letters to test more possibilities.  
The word **EXTRA** satisfies all constraints:
- E is at position 1 (allowed for E).  
- R is at position 4 (allowed for R).  
- A is at position 5 (allowed for A).  
- X and T are new letters not yet ruled out, and the word avoids C, N, V, L.

All other letters tested so far (C, N, V, L, X, T) are not in the word.

A word that fits these constraints and introduces two new letters is **SMEAR**:
- S (new)

- S is correct at position 1.
- M is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 3.
- A is correct at position 4.

Thus the secret word pattern is **S ? E A R**. The only unknown letter is the second one, and it cannot be any of the letters already ruled out (C, N, V, L, X, T, M).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.
