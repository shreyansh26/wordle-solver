### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are present in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter guess that avoids all of those letters. Choosing a common word with different letters will give more information. “MOUTH” uses M, O, U, T, H, none of which have been eliminated, so it’s a good candidate.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H are not in the secret word.
- Letter T is correct and in position 4.
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ T _, with O somewhere except position 2. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and avoids all eliminated letters is **BLOTS** (B L O T S). It places O at position 3, keeps T at position 4, and introduces new letters B, L, and S for further testing.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, B, L, S are not in the secret word.
- Letter T is confirmed in the fourth position (✓).
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 2 (from guess 2) and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Therefore O can only be in position 1 or 5.

The pattern of the secret word is thus: _ _ _ T _.  
O must be either the first or the last letter.

Remaining unused letters (not eliminated) are: D, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern with O in position 1 or 5, T in position 4, and uses only allowed letters.

A suitable candidate is **DITTO**:
- Positions: D (1), I (2), T (3), T (4), O (5)
- It respects the pattern (the fourth letter is T, the fifth letter is O).
- Introduces two new letters D and I to test their presence.
- Also checks whether a second T exists in the word.

Thus the next guess will be DITTO.
