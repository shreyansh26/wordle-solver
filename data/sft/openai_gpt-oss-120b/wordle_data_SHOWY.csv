### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:

- The letter **O** is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, E, L, I, D** are not in the word at all.

We need a new guess that keeps **S** at the first position, puts **O** somewhere other than the second slot, and introduces new letters to gather more information.  
A good candidate is **SPOUT**:
- Keeps **S** at position 1.
- Places **O** at position 3 (allowed).
- Introduces three fresh letters **P, U, T** that we haven’t tested yet.

This will tell us whether any of those new letters belong in the secret word and also confirm the exact position of **O**.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, I, D, P, U, T, K, M (all marked x).

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4 are those not yet excluded: B, F, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others like O but O is already placed). We need a valid English word matching pattern S _ O _ Y.

The word **SHOWY** fits:
- S at position 1 (correct)
- H at position 2 (new, not excluded)
- O at position 3 (correct)
- W at position 4 (new, not excluded)
- Y at position 5 (correct)

Thus SHOWY is a logical next guess.
