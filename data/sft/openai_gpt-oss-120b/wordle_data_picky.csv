### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give me useful information about which letters are present and their positions. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (S, L, T). This should provide a solid base for the first feedback.

All five letters from the first guess (S, L, A, T, E) are confirmed absent from the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely, choosing common letters to maximize information. 
Possible candidates include words like “CRONY”, “FROWN”, “MUNCH”, etc. “CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y – none of which were ruled out, giving a good mix of consonants and a vowel (O). This should provide useful feedback for the next step.
