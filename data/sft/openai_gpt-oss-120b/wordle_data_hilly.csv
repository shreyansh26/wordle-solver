### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common introductory word that contains a variety of common letters and vowel placements to gather useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which will help identify letters and positions early on.

The feedback from the first guess indicates that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are present in the secret word. I need to choose a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely while still being a common English word to gather useful information. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T, all of which have not been ruled out, so it’s a good next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, T are not in the word.
- I is correct at position 2.
- H is in the word but not at position 4.

Thus the secret word has pattern: _ I _ _ _. H must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
We need a new guess that respects these constraints and tests new letters.  
“HILLY” fits: H (possible position 1), I (correct at 2), L, L, Y (all untested letters). No eliminated letters are used.
