### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, balanced starter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess in Wordle because it tests two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): all letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From guess 2 (MIGHT): 
  - M, H are not in the word.
  - I is correct at position 2.
  - G is correct at position 3.
  - T is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ I G _ T.  
We need a real 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern using letters that have not been ruled out (cannot use C,R,A,N,E,M,H).  

Possible candidates include **BIGOT** (B I G O T) and **DIGIT** (D I G I T).  
DIGIT repeats the letter I, which we have not seen elsewhere, but BIGOT uses only new letters B and O, both of which are still possible.  

Choosing BIGOT gives fresh letters B and O to test while respecting the known positions.
