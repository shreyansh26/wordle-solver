### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that the letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since it got a “-” in position 5 of “crane”). Therefore our next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E, but place it in a different position (1‑4).
- Introduce new letters to test.

The word “gives” meets these criteria:
- Contains no C, R, A, N.
- Contains E in position 4 (different from position 5).
- Adds the new letters G, I, V, S for further information.
Thus “gives” is a suitable second guess.
