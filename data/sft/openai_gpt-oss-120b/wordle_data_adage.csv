### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give me a good spread of feedback for the secret word.

We have confirmed that the secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5. All letters C, R, N, S, H, P, B, L, M, Q, U, K have been eliminated. Remaining possible letters include D, F, G, I, J, O, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need a word matching the pattern __A_E that only uses still‑possible letters. A good candidate is **ADAGE** (A D A G E): it fits the pattern (A in position 3, E in position 5) and introduces new letters D and G while also testing whether there is another A at position 1.
