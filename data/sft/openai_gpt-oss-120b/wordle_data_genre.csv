### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common, information‑rich guess. 
A good first word contains a mix of frequent letters and both vowels and consonants, which helps identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. 
""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the two most common vowels A and E. This should give me a solid amount of feedback to work with for subsequent guesses.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **R** and **N** somewhere else (R ≠ 2, N ≠ 4), and cannot contain C or A.  
A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **RINSE**:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3), both not in the forbidden positions.
- Uses only letters we have no information about yet (I, S), which is allowed.

So the next guess will be “RINSE”.

We know from feedback:
- Secret word ends with E.
- N is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, and cannot be position 5 (E). So R must be position 4.
Thus pattern: _ _ N R E.

Letters ruled out: C, A, I, S (not in word). We need a common English word matching __NRE with no prohibited letters.

The word ""GENRE"" fits:
- G (unknown), E (unknown but allowed), N (fixed), R (fixed), E (fixed).
No prohibited letters appear.

So next guess is GENRE.
