### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and both vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes C, R, A, N, E, giving useful information about many frequent letters.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C is in the secret word but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the secret word but NOT in position 5.
- R, A, N are NOT in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C and E in different positions from the first guess and avoids R, A, N. 
Choosing a word that places C in position 3 and E in position 4 satisfies those constraints while testing new letters.

The word **TICED** fits:
- Contains C (position 3) and E (position 4), both not in their original positions.
- Contains no R, A, or N.
- Introduces new letters T, I, D for further clues.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 4 is definitely **E** (E✓ in guess 2).
- The secret word contains **C**, but C is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So C can be in positions 2 or 5.
- The secret word contains **T**, but T is not in position 1 (from guess 2). So T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Letters that are ruled out: R, A, N, I, D (all got an “x”).

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern `_ _ _ E _` and includes C and T in allowed spots, avoiding the excluded letters.

The word **OCTET** satisfies all conditions:
- Pattern: O C T E T → E is in position 4.
- C is in position 2 (allowed) and not in positions 1 or 3.
- T appears in positions 3 and 5, never in position 1.
- None of the forbidden letters (R, A, N, I, D) appear.

Thus OCTET is a legal next guess.
