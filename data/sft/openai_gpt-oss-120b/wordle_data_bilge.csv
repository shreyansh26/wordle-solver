### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of frequent letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving me useful information for the next steps.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5). Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. For the next guess I’ll keep E in the fifth spot and test four new letters that are common and haven’t been ruled out. “SLIDE” fits: S, L, I, D are all still possible, and E remains in the correct final position.

We have the following feedback:
- From guess CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is correct at position 5.
- From guess SLIDE: S and D are not in the word; L and I are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (L is not position 2, I is not position 3). E is again correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **L** and **I** (in other positions), and does not contain C,R,A,N,S,D. We need a new 5‑letter word that respects these constraints.  

A good candidate is **BILGE**:
- Positions: B I L G E
- Contains L (position 3, allowed) and I (position 2, allowed).
- Uses new letters B and G, which have not been ruled out.
- Ends with E in the required fifth position.

So the next guess will be “BILGE”.
