### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 4 is S (✓ from guess 2).
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 1 (‑ from guess 2), so R must be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters L, A, T, O, U are not in the word (x).
- Letter S is confirmed at position 4, so we must keep it there.

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ S E with R in slot 2 or 3. A common word fitting this pattern is **PRISE** (P‑R‑I‑S‑E), which places R in position 2 and introduces new letters P and I to test.
