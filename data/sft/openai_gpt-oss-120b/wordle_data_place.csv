I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes both a vowel and several frequently used consonants, giving useful information about the secret word.

We know the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5.  
C is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 4.  
R and N are not in the word at all.

A good candidate that respects these constraints is **PLACE** (P‑L‑A‑C‑E), which puts C in position 4 and keeps A and E fixed.
