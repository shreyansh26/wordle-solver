### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E) and will give useful information about the secret word.

We know:
- Position 1 = A (✓)
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- A is not at position 3 (A(-) from first guess)
- The second R in “ARROW” got a “-”, so the secret word contains another R somewhere other than position 3.
- O is in the word but not at position 4 (O(-) from “ARROW”).

Thus the word starts **AR** and must contain a second **R** (positions 4 or 5) and an **O** (positions 3 or 5).  
To gather more information we can try a word that keeps the confirmed letters (A at 1, R at 2) and places O at position 3, while using a new letter in the remaining spots. “AROMA” fits these requirements and avoids the letters we know are absent (C, N, E, W).

So the next guess will be:
