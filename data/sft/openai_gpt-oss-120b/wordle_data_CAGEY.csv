### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which will give useful information about the secret word.

From the first feedback:
- C is correct and in the first position.
- R and N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word starts with **C**, contains **A** and **E** somewhere else (A not in position 3, E not in position 5), and has no R or N. A good candidate that fits these constraints is **CAMEL** (C‑A‑M‑E‑L), which places A in position 2 and E in position 4, both allowed.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: G (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: not D (x) and cannot be any previously eliminated letters (R, N, M, L, V, S, D).

The pattern is C A G E _. The only common English word that fits this pattern and hasn't been ruled out is **CAGEY** (meaning cautious). Y hasn't been tested yet, so this guess will verify the final letter.
