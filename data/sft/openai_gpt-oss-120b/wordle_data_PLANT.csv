### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to begin the Wordle-like game with a common, well‑balanced starter word that contains a mix of frequently used consonants and vowels. “CRANE” has two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), making it a solid first guess.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓)
- Position 4 is N (✓)
- Letters C, R, and E are not in the word at any position (x)

Thus the secret word has the pattern ??AN?. We need a valid English word with A in the third slot, N in the fourth, and no C, R, or E elsewhere.

Possible candidates include:
- SWANK (S W A N K)
- SLANT (S L A N T)

Both satisfy the constraints. I’ll choose “SLANT” as the next guess.

From the feedback:
- Positions 2‑5 are confirmed as L A N T.
- Position 1 cannot be S (from SLANT) and cannot be any of C, R, E (from CRANE).
The only common English word fitting the pattern _LANT with those constraints is “PLANT”.
Thus the next guess should be PLANT.
