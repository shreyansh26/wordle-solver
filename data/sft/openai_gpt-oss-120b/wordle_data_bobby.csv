### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): all letters are not in the secret word → eliminate C,R,A,N,E.
- Guess 2 (MIGHT): all letters are not in the secret word → eliminate M,I,G,H,T.
- Guess 3 (FOULS): O is correct in the second position; F,U,L,S are not in the word.
- Guess 4 (WOODY): 
  * W is not in the word.
  * O in position 2 is correct (green).
  * O in position 3 is marked “-”, meaning O exists somewhere else but not in position 3. Since we already have O at position 2, this tells us the secret does **not** have an O at position 3.
  * D is not in the word.
  * Y in position 5 is correct (green).

Thus the pattern is: **_ O _ _ Y**.  
All letters marked “x” are eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,F,U,L,S,W,D.  
Remaining possible letters (besides the confirmed O and Y) are: **B, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z**.

We need a real 5‑letter English word matching `_ O _ _ Y` that uses only the allowed letters.  
“POPPY” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: P O P P Y → matches `_ O _ _ Y`
- Uses only letters P, O, Y which are not eliminated.
- Introduces no new forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
