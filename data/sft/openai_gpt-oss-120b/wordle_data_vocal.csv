### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 3: LOCAL -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the feedback:
- From guess 3 (LOCAL): L at position 1 is marked “-” (letter exists elsewhere), O at 2 is correct, C at 3 is correct, A at 4 is correct, L at 5 is correct.
Thus the secret word is of the form ? O C A L, with L confirmed at the final position. The first letter is not L, and cannot be any letters we have previously eliminated (R, N, E, T, I). Viable common words matching ""?OCAL"" are “FOCAL” and “VOCAL”. Both use letters not yet ruled out. Choosing one to test, I’ll guess “FOCAL”.
