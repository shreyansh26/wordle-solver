### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving good coverage for the first feedback.

We know that the secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Letters C, R, and N are not present anywhere. We need a new five‑letter word that respects these constraints. “SLATE” fits: S L A T E – it places A third and E fifth, and it avoids C, R, and N.

We have the pattern based on feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- Letters C, R, N, L are not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word looks like _ _ A _ E, containing S and T with S ≠ position 1 and T ≠ position 4.  
A word that satisfies all these conditions is **TEASE**:
- T at position 1 (allowed, T is not at position 4),
- E at position 2 (extra E is permissible even though we only know one E at position 5),
- A at position 3 (matches confirmed A),
- S at position 4 (S is present and not at position 1),
- E at position 5 (matches confirmed E).

Therefore, TEASE is a valid next guess.
