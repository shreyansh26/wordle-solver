We have the following feedback:
- CRANE: only E correct at position 5.
- MOUSE: only E correct at position 5.
- GLIDE: only E correct at position 5.
- BETTE: E correct at position 2 and position 5; T present but not in positions 3 or 4; B not in word.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
1: unknown (cannot be B, cannot be T because T is not in position 1? Actually T could be position 1; we haven't ruled it out.)
2: E (confirmed)
3: not T
4: not T
5: E (confirmed)

Both T’s in BETTE got “-”, meaning T exists somewhere else, but not in positions 3 or 4. The only remaining slots for T are positions 1, 2, or 5. Positions 2 and 5 are already E, so T must be in position 1. Therefore the word starts with T and ends with E, giving the pattern **T E _ _ E**.

All letters used so far that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, M, O, U, S, G, L, I, D, B. Remaining possible letters for the 3rd and 4th positions are: F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word fitting **T E _ _ E** with allowed letters is **TEPEE** (a type of tent). It uses the new letter P and repeats E, which is allowed.

Thus the next guess should be TEPEE.
