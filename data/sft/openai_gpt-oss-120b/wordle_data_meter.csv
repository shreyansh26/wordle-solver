### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R and E are in the secret word but not in the positions we guessed (R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
* Includes R and E,
* Does not place R in the second slot nor E in the fifth,
* Avoids the letters C, A, N,
* Introduces some new letters to gather more information.

“SHRED” fits these constraints:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 4), neither in the forbidden slots.
- Uses only allowed letters (S, H, D are new, none of C, A, N).
- Is a valid English word.

- R at position 1 (testing if R belongs at the start).  
- I, V, T are new letters that haven’t been tried yet, giving us fresh information.  
- Pattern fits: R _ _ E _.

- Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, H, D, I, V, T.
The word pattern is ___ER with the first three letters all unknown and must avoid the excluded letters.

Choose a word that fits the pattern and introduces new, untried letters. “JOKER” (J O K E R) satisfies:
- Ends with ER in the correct positions.
- Uses new letters J, O, K that haven’t been tested yet.
- Contains no excluded letters.

Thus the next guess should be “JOKER”.

We have determined the secret word pattern is ___ER, with E confirmed at position 4 and R at position 5. All other letters tried so far (C, A, N, S, H, D, I, V, T, J, O, K) are not in the word. Remaining possible letters include B, F, G, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

A common English word fitting the pattern and using new letters is **BLUER** (B L U E R). This respects all known constraints and introduces three fresh letters (B, L, U) for further information.

Thus the next guess should be “BLUER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
* Includes R and E,
* Does not place R in the second slot nor E in the fifth,
* Avoids the letters C, A, N,
* Introduces some new letters to gather more information.

“SHRED” fits these constraints:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 4), neither in the forbidden slots.
- Uses only allowed letters (S, H, D are new, none of C, A, N).
- Is a valid English word.

- Position 5 is definitely **R** (from JOKER and confirmed).
- The letter **R** cannot be in positions 1‑3 (R(-) on guesses 1‑3), so it must be only at the last slot.
- All other letters tried are not in the word: C, A, N, S, H, D, I, V, T, J, O, K, B, L, U.

The remaining possible letters (excluding those eliminated) are: **F, G, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z** (and the already‑known E and R).

A common word that fits is **FEWER** (F E W E R):
- Ends with **ER** and has **E** in the fourth position.
- Contains only new letters F and W besides the known E and R.
- No extra R appears in the first three positions.
