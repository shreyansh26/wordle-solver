### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 is correct).
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing R somewhere other than the second position, and avoiding C, A, N.  
Choosing a word that introduces several new letters will give us the most information for the next guess.  

**FORGE** fits all constraints:
- Ends with **E**.
- Contains **R** at position 3 (different from position 2).
- Introduces new letters **F**, **O**, **G** which we haven’t tested yet.
- Does not contain any excluded letters.
