### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 2: A (correct).
- Position 3: unknown, cannot be C, R, B, G, T, K.
- Position 4: E (correct).
- Position 5: N (correct).

We need a common 5‑letter word fitting _ A _ E N with allowed letters. “HAVEN” satisfies all constraints:
- H and V have not been ruled out.
- Pattern H A V E N matches the known positions.
Thus “HAVEN” is a valid next guess.

We have feedback:
- Position2 A is correct.
- Position4 E is correct.
- Position5 N is correct.
- Letters eliminated (X) from previous guesses: C, R, B, G, T, K, H, V.

Thus pattern is _ A _ E N, with allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 being any except the eliminated ones. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is ""LADEN"" (L A D E N). L and D have not been ruled out. This satisfies all constraints.
