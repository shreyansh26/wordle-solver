### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The previous guess “CRANE” gave the feedback:
- C, R, A, and E are marked “x”, so those letters are not in the secret word at all.
- N is marked “✓” in the fourth position, so the secret word has N as its fourth letter.

Therefore the next guess must:
1. Have N in the fourth position.
2. Contain none of the letters C, R, A, or E.

A common 5‑letter word meeting these constraints is **MOUND** (M‑O‑U‑N‑D), which places N correctly at position 4 and introduces new letters to test.
