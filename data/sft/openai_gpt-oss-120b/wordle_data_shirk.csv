### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that the secret word does NOT contain C, A, N, or E. The letter R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

For the next guess we should:
- Keep R in a different position to test where it belongs.
- Use only letters that have not been ruled out.
- Include a mix of common consonants and vowels to gather more info.

A good candidate is **RISKY**:
- R is placed at position 1 (different from the previous guess).
- I, S, K, Y are all letters we have no information about yet.
- None of the letters are C, A, N, or E, which are known to be absent.

Thus this guess will tell us if R belongs in position 1 and will test four new letters.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From previous feedback:
- Letters C, A, N, E, I, S, K, Y are not in the secret word.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from guesses CRANE and RISKY).

Thus R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
We need a valid 5‑letter word that includes R in one of those positions and uses none of the excluded letters.

Candidate: **GOURD**  
- Contains R in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses letters G, O, U, D, none of which have been eliminated.

This guess will test R at position 4 and introduce four new letters.

We have confirmed that the secret word has H in position 2 and R in position 4. All vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and Y have been marked absent, so the remaining letters are limited to consonants. To continue gathering information, I’ll guess a word that keeps H and R in the known correct spots and introduces new consonants to test. “WHIRR” fits the pattern (H₂, R₄) and adds W and I (to double‑check I) plus an extra R.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the next guess we should:
- Keep R in a different position to test where it belongs.
- Use only letters that have not been ruled out.
- Include a mix of common consonants and vowels to gather more info.

A good candidate is **RISKY**:
- R is placed at position 1 (different from the previous guess).
- I, S, K, Y are all letters we have no information about yet.
- None of the letters are C, A, N, or E, which are known to be absent.

Thus this guess will tell us if R belongs in position 1 and will test four new letters.

We have established the following fixed letters from the feedback:
- Position 2 = H (from THORN and WHIRR).
- Position 3 = I (from WHIRR).
- Position 4 = R (from GOURD and THORN).

Thus the word pattern is **_ H I R _**.

Letters confirmed to be in the word but not yet placed:
- S (present, not in position 3).
- K (present, not in position 4).

Both S and K can therefore occupy positions 1 or 5.

All other letters have been ruled out (C, A, N, E, G, O, U, D, T, Y, W, etc.), so a word that fits the pattern and uses S and K in the remaining slots is **SHIRK**:
- S in position 1 (allowed, not previously forbidden).
- H in position 2 (✓).
- I in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 4 (✓).
- K in position 5 (present, not in position 4, satisfying the earlier “K(-)” clue).
