We know the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N. We need a new guess with E in the fifth position and new letters to test. Choose a common word without the excluded letters. “LOUSE” fits: L O U S E, with E correctly placed at the end and introduces L, O, U, S for testing.

From previous feedback:
- Position 1 is L (✓ from LOUSE).
- Position 2 is O (✓ from LOUSE).
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, A, N, U, S are not in the word (all marked x).
Thus the secret word fits the pattern L O _ _ E, with the 3rd and 4th letters unknown and not among the excluded letters. A common word matching this pattern is ""LODGE"" (L O D G E), introducing D and G as new candidates.
