### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. It DOES contain the letter N, but N cannot be in the 4th position (since it was marked “-” in position 4 of CRANE). Therefore the new guess must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and avoid the letters C, R, A, E entirely.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “NIGHT” places N in position 1, and uses only letters I, G, H, and T, none of which have been ruled out. This makes it a solid next guess.

- Letters C, R, A, E, G, H, T are not in the word.
- Letter I is correct at position 2.
- Letter N is in the word but not at positions 1 (from NIGHT) or 4 (from CRANE). So N can be at position 3 or 5.

We have determined from feedback:
- I is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3 (the only remaining slot after eliminating other positions).
- Eliminated letters: A, B, C, E, G, H, L, O, R, S, T, V, Y, plus the earlier ones C,R,A,E,G,H,T,B,S,O,V,Y,L.
Remaining possible letters for positions 1,4,5 are among D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (and maybe others not yet tested).
A common English word fitting the pattern _ I N _ _ with only unused letters is **PINUP** (P I N U P), which uses P and U that have not been ruled out.
Thus the next guess should be PINUP.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. It DOES contain the letter N, but N cannot be in the 4th position (since it was marked “-” in position 4 of CRANE). Therefore the new guess must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and avoid the letters C, R, A, E entirely.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints, “NIGHT” places N in position 1, and uses only letters I, G, H, and T, none of which have been ruled out. This makes it a solid next guess.

- Letters C, R, A, E, G, H, T are not in the word.
- Letter I is correct at position 2.
- Letter N is in the word but not at positions 1 (from NIGHT) or 4 (from CRANE). So N can be at position 3 or 5.
- We need a word of the form _ I _ _ _. 

Considering common words that fit and introduce new letters, **BISON** fits:
- Pattern B I S O N → I is at position 2.
- N would be at position 5 (one of the allowed spots).
- New letters B, S, O have not been ruled out.

Thus BISON is a good next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern:

- Position 2 = I (✓ from NIGHT, BISON, VINYL, PINUP)
- Position 3 = N (✓ from VINYL, PINUP)
- Letter O is in the word, not in position 4 (O(-) from BISON) → O can be position 1 or 5.
- Letter G is in the word, not in position 3 (G(-) from NIGHT) → G can be position 1, 4, or 5.
- All other letters guessed have been marked absent (C,R,A,E,H,T,B,S,V,Y,L,P,U and others).

Thus the word must be of the form _ I N _ _. It must contain both G and O, with O at position 5 (since position 4 is taken by G in a common word) and G at position 4. The remaining first letter must be a letter not yet eliminated; D fits.

The word **DINGO** satisfies:
- I at 2, N at 3,
- G at 4 (allowed),
- O at 5 (allowed),
- D is a new letter not previously ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be DINGO.
