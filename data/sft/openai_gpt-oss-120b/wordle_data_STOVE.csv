### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess gave feedback that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all, while E is correct and in the fifth position. Therefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and contains none of the letters C, R, A, N.

I need a new 5‑letter word that ends with E, uses only letters not yet ruled out, and introduces new letters to gather more information. A good candidate is **SHOVE** (S‑H‑O‑V‑E). It ends with E, and the letters S, H, O, V have not been tested yet.

We have determined the secret word layout from feedback:
- Position 1: S (✓ from SHOVE)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: V (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓ from both guesses)

Only position 2 is unknown. The word must be a valid English word of the form S?OVE. The obvious candidate is ""STOVE"", with T in the second slot. T has not been tried yet, so this guess will confirm the final letter.
