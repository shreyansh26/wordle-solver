### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes S, L, A, T, and E, covering both common consonants and a vowel.

Feedback summary:
- T is correct at position 4.
- A is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, P, R, Y.

We need a word of the form _ _ _ T _. Placing A at position 5 satisfies the constraints (A cannot be 2 or 3). The pattern becomes ???TA. A common English word fitting this pattern and avoiding the excluded letters is **JUNTA** (J U N T A). It uses allowed letters only and puts A at position 5.
