### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter C is correct and in position 1 (C ✓).
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from previous feedback). Therefore E must be in position 4.
- The letters H, W, Y, A, R, I, S, M, L, O, N are not in the word.
- We need a 5‑letter word of the form **C _ _ E _**, using only letters not yet ruled out.

A suitable word that fits this pattern and introduces new letters is **CUBED** (C‑U‑B‑E‑D). It places E in the required fourth position and avoids all excluded letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- C is correct in position 1 (C✓).
- E is correct in position 4 (E✓).

From previous guesses:
- M is in the word but not in position 1 (M‑), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (O‑), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- All other guessed letters marked “x” are not in the word: A, R, I, S, L, N, H, W, Y, U, B, D, plus the “x” from MELON (L and N) and from ARISE (A,R,I,S).

Thus the remaining unknown positions are 2, 3, and 5, which must include the letters M and O (and one additional letter not yet ruled out). A common English word that fits the pattern C _ _ E _ and contains both M and O in allowed spots is **COMET** (C‑O‑M‑E‑T).

- C is already correct at position 1.
- O is placed at position 2 (allowed, not position 4).
- M is placed at position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- E remains at position 4 (already confirmed).
- T is a new letter, not previously eliminated.

Therefore, the next logical guess is **COMET**.
