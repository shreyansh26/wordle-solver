### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to make an initial guess of a 5‑letter English word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common starter that contains a mix of frequent letters to maximize information. “CRANE” is a good choice because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E).

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the next guess must include the letter C (not as the first letter) and must avoid R, A, N, E. I’ll choose a word that places C in a different position and uses other common letters. “SCOLD” fits: it has C in the second slot and uses only allowed letters (S, O, L, D). This will test several new letters while keeping C positioned differently.

From the feedback:
- The letters C, S, O, and L are all in the secret word but each is in a different position than in the previous guesses.
- Positions ruled out:
  * C cannot be 1st or 2nd.
  * S cannot be 1st.
  * O cannot be 3rd.
  * L cannot be 4th.
- Letters D, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

A common 5‑letter word that contains exactly the letters C, S, O, L plus one new letter and respects all position constraints is **LOCUS** (L O C U S).  
- L is now 1st (allowed).  
- O is 2nd (not 3rd).  
- C is 3rd (not 1st/2nd).  
- S is 5th (not 1st).  
- U is a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be “LOCUS”.
