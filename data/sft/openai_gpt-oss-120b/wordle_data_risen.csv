### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4 (from earlier “-” feedback), so it must be in position 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **R I _ _ N**.

We need to test which letters belong in positions 3 and 4. The letters already ruled out are C, A, E, O, T, H, K, S. Remaining common letters include D, F, G, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A common English word matching R I _ _ N is **RIPEN**, which would also test the previously eliminated letter E (to confirm it truly isn’t in the word). This guess keeps R and I fixed, places N at the end, and introduces P and E for positions 3 and 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

  * R is not in position 2 (from “CRANE”) and not in position 3 (from “NORTH”), so R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that:
- Contains N and R placed only in the allowed slots.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

The word **RINKS** fits:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- The other letters I, K, S have not been eliminated.
Thus it will test the positions of R and N while introducing new letters.
