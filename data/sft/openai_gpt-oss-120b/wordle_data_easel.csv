### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From “crane”: C,R,N are not in the word; A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- From “bleat”: B,T are not in the word; L is in the word but not position 2; E is still in the word but not position 3; A is still in the word but not position 4.

So the secret word must contain A, E, L and exclude C,R,N,B,T. Position constraints:
- A cannot be 3rd or 4th → possible positions 1,2,5.
- E cannot be 3rd or 5th → possible positions 1,2,4.
- L cannot be 2nd → possible positions 1,3,4,5.

A common 5‑letter word satisfying all these constraints and using only allowed letters is **MALES** (M A L E S):
- A is in position 2 (allowed),
- L is in position 3 (allowed),
- E is in position 4 (allowed),
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus “MALES” is a logical next guess.
