### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first feedback we know:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, N, E.
- Include A in a different slot (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
- Introduce several new letters to test.

A good candidate is **BALMY**: it contains A in the 2nd position and adds B, L, M, Y, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have these constraints from feedback:

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, B, M, Y.
- Letters that are in the word but NOT in certain positions:
  * A is in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BALMY and CRANE).
  * L is in the word, but cannot be in position 3 (from BALMY).

Thus the secret word must contain A and L, plus three other letters not among the excluded set. We need a guess that respects the position restrictions and introduces new letters.

A good candidate is **VITAL**:
- Positions: V(1) I(2) T(3) A(4) L(5)
- A is placed at position 4 (allowed) and L at position 5 (allowed).
- New letters V, I, T have not been tested yet and are not in the excluded list.
This guess will tell us whether V, I, T are present and further narrow down A and L positions.
