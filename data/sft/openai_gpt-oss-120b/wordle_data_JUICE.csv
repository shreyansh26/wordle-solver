### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the pattern of the secret word from previous feedback:

- Position 5 = E (from all guesses).
- Position 3 = I (✓ from TWICE).
- Position 4 = C (✓ from TWICE).
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, O, P, T, W are not in the indicated positions or are absent entirely.
- The remaining unknown letters are positions 1 and 2, and they must not be any of the excluded letters.

A common English word that fits the pattern __ICE with allowed letters is **JUICE** (J U I C E). Neither J nor U have been ruled out, so this guess will test them.
