### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern from feedback:

- From CRANE we get:
  * R is correct at position 2 (✓).
  * A and E remain correct at positions 3 and 5.

Letters known to be absent (x) are: S, L, T, C, N, and also from CRANE, C and N are excluded. So we must avoid those letters.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching _ R A _ E without using the excluded letters. Good candidates are:

  * A and E remain correct at positions 3 and 5.
Therefore the word fits the pattern: _ R A _ E.

Letters known to be absent (x) are: S, L, T, C, N, and also from CRANE, C and N are excluded. So we must avoid those letters.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching _ R A _ E without using the excluded letters. Good candidates are:
- GRAPE (G R A P E)
- DRAPE (D R A P E)
- BRAVE (B R A V E)
- FRAME (F R A M E)

Choosing a word that introduces new letters maximizes information. “GRAPE” adds the previously unseen letters G and P, so it is an optimal next guess.

Thus we guess **GRAPE**.

Feedback so far:
- Position 2 = R (✓ from CRANE and GRAPE)
- Position 3 = A (✓ from SLATE, CRANE, GRAPE)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from SLATE, CRANE, GRAPE)

Letters that are not in the word (marked x): S, L, T, C, N, G, P.

Thus we need a five‑letter English word of the form _ R A _ E that does not contain any of the excluded letters. 

Candidates:
- **BRAVE** (B R A V E) – uses only new letters B and V, none are excluded.
- Other possibilities like DRAPE, GRACE, CRATE, etc., all contain at least one excluded letter (P, G, C, etc.).

Therefore the best next guess is **BRAVE** to test the remaining unknown letters B and V and confirm the word.
