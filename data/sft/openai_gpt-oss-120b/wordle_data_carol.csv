### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess SLATE the feedback was:
- S: not in the word
- L: in the word but not in position 2
- A: in the word but not in position 3
- T: not in the word
- E: not in the word

Thus the secret word must contain **L** and **A**, with L ≠ position 2 and A ≠ position 3, and must not contain S, T, or E. A good next guess should keep L and A in new positions while testing other common letters.  
The word **MALIC** satisfies these constraints:
- L is in position 3 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- It introduces new letters M, I, C to gather more information.
- It contains no prohibited letters (S, T, E).

Therefore, the next guess will be MALIC.

We have determined the fixed letters from feedback:

- Position 3 is R (R ✓ in guess 3).

Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed:
- L is present, but not in positions 1, 2, 3 (it got “-” at positions 1 in LARCH and at position 3 in MALIC). So L can be only in position 4 or 5.
- C is present, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (it got “-” at 4 in LARCH and at 5 in MALIC). Therefore C must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is **C A R _ _** with L occupying either the 4th or 5th slot.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **CAROL** (C A R O L), which places L at position 5 and introduces a new letter O that has not been ruled out.
