### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 2: BANDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, E, B, D, Y.
- A is confirmed at position 2 (A✓).
- N is in the word but not at position 3 (N-). It can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- The remaining three positions (1, 3, 4, 5) need letters that have not been ruled out.

Choose a word that:
1. Has A at the second position.
2. Places N somewhere other than the third position.
3. Introduces new, plausible letters.

The word **NAILS** fits:
- N is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- I, L, S are new letters not yet eliminated.
Thus this guess will test N’s placement and give information about I, L, and S.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- N is correct at position 1 (N✓).
- A is correct at position 2 (A✓).
- L is in the word but not at position 4 (L- from NAILS, where L was at position 4).

Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, E, B, D, Y, I, S.

Thus the secret word pattern is: N A _ _ _.  
L must occupy either position 3 or 5.  
We need to choose new letters not yet eliminated. A duplicate A is allowed, and V is still possible.

The word **NAVAL** fits all constraints:
- N at 1, A at 2 (confirmed).
- L at 5 (L not at 4, so allowed).
- V is a new, not‑eliminated letter.
- The second A at position 4 does not conflict with any feedback.

So we guess NAVAL.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1: N (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 4: A (✓)
- Position 5: L (✓)
- Position 3: Not V, and must be a letter not previously ruled out (C, R, E, B, D, Y, I, S, V are all out).

We need a valid English word matching the pattern N A _ A L. A common word that fits is **NATAL** (meaning related to birth). The missing letter T has not been eliminated, so it is a viable candidate.

Thus the next guess should be NATAL.
