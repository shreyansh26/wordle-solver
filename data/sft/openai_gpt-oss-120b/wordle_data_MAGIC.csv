### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:

  - C is in the word but not in position 0.
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.
  - R, N, E are not in the word.

- From guess 2 (PATCH):
  - A is correct in position 1 (second letter).
  - C is in the word but not in position 3.
  - P, T, H are not in the word.

Thus:
- Position 1 = **A** (fixed).
- C must be somewhere other than positions 0, 1, 3 → possible positions are 2 or 4.
- All excluded letters are R, N, E, P, T, H, plus any repeats of those.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **BASIC**:
- B A S I C
- A is at position 1 (✓).
- C is at position 4 (allowed).
- No excluded letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be BASIC.
