### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 is correct).
- Letter **R** is in the word but not at position 2.
- Letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word at all.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Contains **R** somewhere other than the second spot.
3. Avoids the letters C, A, N.

A good candidate is **TORTE**:
- Pattern: T O R T E → ends with E, R is in position 3 (not position 2), and it contains none of the forbidden letters C, A, N.
This guess will test the presence of T and O while respecting all known constraints.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 5 is E (confirmed).
- The letters R, O, and T are all present somewhere in the word.
- R is NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- O is NOT in position 2.
- T is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E that contains R, O, T and respects those position rules.

The word **STORE** (S T O R E) satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains T in position 2 (allowed), O in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters C, A, N.

Thus STORE is a valid next guess.
