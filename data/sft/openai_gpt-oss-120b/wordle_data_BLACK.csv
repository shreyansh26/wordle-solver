### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:
- Secret word is 5 letters.
- From the first guess CRANE we got:
  - C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - R(x): R is not in the word.
  - A(✓): A is correct and in position 3.
  - N(x): N is not in the word.
  - E(x): E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word contains A at the third spot and also contains C somewhere other than the first position. The letters R, N, and E are eliminated.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more info. A good candidate is **SCAMP**:
- Positions: S(1), C(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)
- It places C at position 2 (allowed, since C cannot be at 1).
- It keeps A at position 3 (confirmed).
- It avoids the eliminated letters R, N, E.
- It introduces new letters S, M, P to test.

Therefore, the next guess will be SCAMP.
