### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From Guess 3 (TRIED) feedback:
- T is not in the word.
- D received a “-”, meaning D is in the word but not in position 5. Since positions 2‑4 are taken, D must be in position 1.

Thus the word pattern is **D R I E _**.

Letters confirmed not in the word: C, A, N, B, F, T.

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching D R I E ?. Options include:
- DRIED (uses D twice)
- DRIES (adds S)

Both satisfy known constraints. “DRIES” is a common word and introduces a new letter S, which hasn’t been ruled out. It’s a good next guess.

We know from the feedback:
- Positions 1-4 are D, R, I, E respectively (all ✓).
- Position 5 is unknown.
- The letter S is not in the word (x).
- From guess 3, D was marked “-” meaning D is in the word but not at position 5, confirming D cannot be at the last spot.
Thus the word form is D R I E _. The only common English word fitting this pattern, not using S and not placing D at the fifth spot, is **DRIER** (the comparative of “dry”). This introduces another R at the final position, which is allowed.
