### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that contains a mix of common letters is “CRANE”. It uses two frequently occurring consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good chance of obtaining useful feedback.

The first guess gave feedback that only the letter A in the third position is correct, while C, R, N, and E are not in the word at any position. Therefore, the secret word must have A as the third letter and must avoid the letters C, R, N, and E entirely. I need a new 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern __A__ and does not contain any of those excluded letters. “SMALL” fits: S‑M‑A‑L‑L, with A in the third spot and none of the prohibited letters present.

We know:
- The third letter is A (from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, N, E, M are not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

Thus possible placements:
- L can be at position 1 or 2.
- S can be at position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1).

A word that fits these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **GLASS**:
- G (allowed) L (position 2) A (position 3) S (position 4) S (position 5)
- L is not at 4 or 5, S is not at 1, and all letters are permissible.
