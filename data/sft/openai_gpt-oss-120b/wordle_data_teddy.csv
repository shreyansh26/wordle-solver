### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback, letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.

We have gathered the following constraints from the feedback:

- Positions: _ E _ _ Y (E is confirmed in position 2, Y in position 5).
- The letter T is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4, so it must be in position 1.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, S, U, P, F, H, plus any letters that received “x” in earlier guesses.
- Remaining letters can be used freely.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **T E _ _ Y**. A common English word matching this pattern and respecting all exclusions is **TEDDY**.
