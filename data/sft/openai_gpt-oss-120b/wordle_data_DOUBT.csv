### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a solid opening guess that contains common letters and no repeats. A good starter is “CRANE”, which includes frequent consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, L, H are not in the word.
- The word contains O and T, but O is not in position 3 and T is not in position 4.
We need a new guess that includes O and T in different positions, and uses only letters not yet eliminated.
A suitable word is **MOTIF**:
- Contains O (position 2) and T (position 3), both away from their disallowed spots.
- Uses letters M, I, F which have not been ruled out.
Thus MOTIF satisfies all constraints.

- O is confirmed in the word and green at position 2 (from MOTIF).
- T is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from SLOTH and MOTIF). Since position 2 is occupied by O, T can only be at position 1 or 5.
- Remaining possible letters are B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, T).
