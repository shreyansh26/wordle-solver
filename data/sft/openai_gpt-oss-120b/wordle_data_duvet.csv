### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L are not in the secret word.
- The word contains two E's: one fixed at position 4 (✓) and another elsewhere, but not at position 3 (the other E got “-”). So the second E must be at position 1 or 2.
- The letter T is correct at position 5.

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ E T with an extra E in position 1 or 2.

A valid English word fitting this pattern and avoiding the prohibited letters is **BEGET** (B E G E T): it has E at positions 2 and 4, T at 5, and uses only new letters B and G.

Guess 3: BEGET -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) G(x) E(✓) T(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (SLEET): S, L are not in the word; one E is in the word but not in position 3; an E is correct at position 4; T is correct at position 5.
- From guess 3 (BEGET): B, G are not in the word; the E at position 2 is in the word but not at position 2; the E at position 4 and T at position 5 are correct.

Combining these:
- The word ends with **ET** (positions 4‑5 are E and T respectively).
- There are two E’s total. One is fixed at position 4; the other cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (from the “-” feedback), so it must be at position 1.
- Thus the pattern is **E _ _ E T**.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, B, G, plus any letters shown as “x”.

We need a real English word fitting **E??ET** that uses only allowed letters. “EMMET” (meaning an ant) fits:
- E at position 1,
- M at positions 2 and 3 (M is not excluded),
- E at position 4,
- T at position 5.

Therefore the next guess is “EMMET”.

We have determined the secret word pattern is ___ET with the fourth letter fixed as E and the fifth as T. Excluded letters from previous feedback are A, B, C, G, L, M, N, R, S. Remaining possible letters for the first three positions include D, F, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. A common English word fitting the pattern and using only allowed letters is **DUVET** (D U V E T). This satisfies all constraints.
