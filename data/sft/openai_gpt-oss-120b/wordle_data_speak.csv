### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: A (✓)

Eliminated letters (x): C, R, N, L, D, W, T, H, F, plus earlier x’s.

From Guess 2, P was marked “-”, meaning P is in the word but not in position 1. Since positions 2–5 are still open, P must be in either position 2 or 5.

Testing the pattern **S _ E A _**:
- If P occupies position 2 we get “S P E A _”. The only common English word fitting this pattern and using only unused letters is **SPEAK** (with K at position 5). This respects all previous feedback: S, E, A are correct; P is present (now at position 2); K has not been ruled out.
- If P were at position 5 the pattern would be “S _ E A P”, but no standard English word fits that pattern.

Therefore “SPEAK” is the most logical next guess.
