### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 5: T (✓)
- Position 1: H was marked x, so the first letter cannot be H. No other letters have been ruled out for position 1.

The pattern is _ A U N T. The possible English words that fit are **GAUNT** and **TAUNT**. Both are valid, and neither G nor T has been excluded from the first position. I’ll guess **GAUNT** first.

We have determined the secret word pattern from all feedback:
- Position 2 = A (✓)
- Position 3 = U (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓)
- Position 5 = T (✓)

Only the first letter is unknown. Letters eliminated from previous guesses: C, R, E, S, I, H, G. Therefore the first letter cannot be any of those.

Possible English words fitting the pattern _AUNT are:
- DAUNT
- JAUNT
- TAUNT
- LAUNT (not common)
- FAUNT (not a standard word)

We need to test a new first-letter candidate. Choosing **DAUNT** introduces a new letter D and is a common word.

Thus the next guess is DAUNT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Thus the target pattern is _ _ _ N _. A can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

“SAINT” fits: S A I N T (A in position 2, N in position 4, no forbidden letters).
