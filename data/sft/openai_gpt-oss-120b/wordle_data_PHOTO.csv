### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Letters M, I, G are not in the word.
- H and T are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in ""MIGHT"": H is not position 4, T is not position 5.
- Letters C, R, A, N, E are also ruled out from the first guess.

So the secret word must avoid {C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G} and include H and T in different positions (H ≠ 4, T ≠ 5). Choose a common word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters.

Word chosen: **HOTLY**
- Contains H (position 1, not 4) and T (position 3, not 5).
- Uses only allowed letters (O, L, Y are new and not ruled out).

Thus this guess will test the remaining possibilities.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:

- Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, L, Y, O.
- H is in the word, but not in positions 1 (from ""HOTLY""), 4 (from ""MIGHT"").
- T is in the word, but not in positions 3 (from ""HOTLY"") or 5 (from ""MIGHT"").

Possible positions:
- H can be at 2, 3, or 5.
- T can be at 1, 2, or 4.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word using only the remaining letters (B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z) and satisfying the position constraints.

A word that fits is **THUDS**:
- T is at position 1 (allowed for T).
- H is at position 2 (allowed for H).
- The remaining letters U, D, S are all permitted and have not been ruled out.

Thus this guess will test the positions of H and T while introducing new letters.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letters eliminated (X): C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, L, Y, U, D, S, O? Wait O is not eliminated; actually O is present (see below). Also eliminated: O is present, not eliminated.
- From Guess 2 (MIGHT): H present not at position 4; T present not at position 5.
- From Guess 3 (HOTLY): H present not at position 1; T present not at position 3; O present not at position 2.
- From Guess 4 (THUDS): H is correct at position 2; T present but not at position 1.

Combining these constraints:
- H is fixed at position 2.
- T cannot be at positions 1,3,5, so the only remaining spot is position 4.
- O is present and cannot be at position 2; positions 1,3,5 are possible.

Thus the word pattern is: _ H _ T _
with O occupying one of the remaining slots (1,3,5). A common English word that fits this pattern and satisfies all constraints is **PHOTO** (P H O T O). This places H at 2, T at 4, and O at positions 3 and 5 (both allowed), introducing a new letter P that hasn't been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be PHOTO.
