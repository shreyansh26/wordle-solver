### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has A in the third position and N in the fourth position, while C, R, and E are not present anywhere. We need a common five‑letter word matching the pattern __AN_ without using C, R, or E. “SWANK” fits: S (not excluded) in position 1, W in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4, and K in position 5. It satisfies all constraints, so we’ll guess it.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- Position 5: K (✓)

Excluded letters: C, R, E, W, H, P, plus any others not in word. The only unknown is position 2.

Possible English words fitting S?ANK, with the unknown letter not excluded, are:
- STANK (T)
- SKANK (K) – would require a second K, which is possible but less common.
- SLANK (L) – rare/archaic.
Given typical word lists, STANK is the most common and fits all constraints.

Thus guess STANK.
