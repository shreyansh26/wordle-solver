### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, S, H, F, and also from FLARE the F is wrong. So possible first letters are any not excluded, such as B, G, D, M, etc. Common English words that fit the pattern are ""BLARE"" and ""GLARE"". Both are valid, and we have no further info to differentiate them. I'll choose one of them to test.

We have the pattern ? L A R E. The confirmed letters are:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: E
Excluded letters (not in the word) are: C, N, S, H, F, G, plus any others from previous guesses that got an ""x"": from CRANE C and N, SHARE S and H, FLARE F, GLARE G. The only plausible common English word fitting ? L A R E without using those excluded letters is **BLARE**.
