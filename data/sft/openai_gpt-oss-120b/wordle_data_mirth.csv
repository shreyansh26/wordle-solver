### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess I want to choose a common, information‑rich word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a popular starter in Wordle because it contains the frequent vowel “A” and common consonants “C”, “R”, and “N”.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, A, N, or E. The letter R is present but is NOT in the second position (the position it occupied in ""CRANE"").

Therefore, the next guess should:
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Include R in a different position to test its correct slot.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SPORT**:
- Contains R in the fourth position (different from the second).
- Uses common letters S, P, O, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.
- Meets the 5‑letter requirement and avoids the excluded letters.
