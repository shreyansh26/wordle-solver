### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From Guess 1 (CRANE): C, A, N are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 2; E is in the word but not in position 5.  
From Guess 2 (RULER):

- Position 5 is R (✓).  
- The R at position 1 is in the word but not at position 1 (‑), meaning there is another R elsewhere.  
- U and L are not in the word.

Since the R at position 2 is ruled out (from Guess 1) and position 5 already holds an R, the second R must be at position 3.  
Thus the secret word has the pattern: **_ _ R E R**, with distinct letters at positions 1 and 2 that are not any of {C, A, N, U, L}.  

A common English word fitting that pattern and using only allowed letters is **BORER** (B O R E R). It respects all known constraints.

- U and L are not in the word.

Since the R at position 2 is ruled out (from Guess 1) and position 5 already holds an R, the second R must be at position 3.  
Thus the secret word has the pattern: **_ _ R E R**, with distinct letters at positions 1 and 2 that are not any of {C, A, N, U, L}.  

A common English word fitting that pattern and using only allowed letters is **BORER** (B O R E R). It respects all known constraints.

We have determined the following constraints from prior feedback:

- Position 5 is R (✓).
- Letters not in the word at all: C, A, N, U, L, B, O, T.
- M is in the word but not in position 3 (‑ from TIMER). Since positions 2,4,5 are fixed, M must be in position 1.
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet excluded and not M.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
