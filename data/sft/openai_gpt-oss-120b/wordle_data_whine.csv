### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first attempt, I’ll choose a common, well‑balanced word that contains a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. 
“CRANE” includes the letters C, R, A, N, E – providing a good spread of common letters and two vowels, which helps narrow down the secret word quickly.

We know from the first guess that positions 4 and 5 are N and E respectively, and letters C, R, A are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word that fits the pattern ***NE and avoids C, R, A. “STONE” matches: S‑T‑O‑N‑E, with N and E in the correct spots and none of the excluded letters present. This will test three new letters (S, T, O) for positions 1‑3.

We have the pattern ___NE with N in position 4 and E in position 5. The letters C, R, A, S, T, O are confirmed not to be in the word. We need three new letters for positions 1‑3 that haven’t been ruled out. A common word fitting the pattern and using only unused letters is **WHINE** (W, H, I are all still possible). This will test three fresh letters while keeping the confirmed ending NE.
