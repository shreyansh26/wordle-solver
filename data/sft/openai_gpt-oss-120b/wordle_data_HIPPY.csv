# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A valid word meeting these constraints is **IDYLL**:

Thus we can guess “IDYLL” to test the location of I and introduce new letters.

We have determined the secret word pattern from the last feedback:
- Position 2 is I (✓)
- Positions 3 and 4 are P (✓)
- Position 5 is Y (✓)
- Position 1 is still unknown, but cannot be any of the letters marked x previously: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T,D,L,Z and also not I,P,Y (already used). Remaining possible letters include H, B, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X.

The only common English word that fits the pattern _ I P P Y with those constraints is ""HIPPY"" (H I P P Y). H has not been eliminated, so this guess should solve the puzzle.
