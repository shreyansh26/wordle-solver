### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- C, R, A are in the word but not in their original spots: C not position1, R not position2, A not position3.
- N is not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E that includes C, R, A in different positions. “TRACE” fits:
- T (new letter)
- R (now in position2, which is different from its original position2 → actually R was guessed in position2, so it must not be in position2; therefore R in position2 would be invalid. Wait, R was originally in position2 and got a “-”, meaning it is in the word but NOT position2. So we cannot place R in position2. Need R elsewhere.

Let's adjust: place R in position1, A in position2, C in position4, E at 5. Word “R A _ C E”. Possible word “RANGE” (R A N G E) but N is not allowed. “RACKE” not a word. “RAICE” no. “RACE” is 4 letters. “RACKE” no. 

Try putting R in position4, A in position1, C in position2: pattern A C _ R E. Word “AC?RE”. “ACCRE” not a word. “ACORE” not word. “ACRUE” is a word: A C R U E. Check positions: A at pos1 (original A was pos3, allowed), C pos2 (original C pos1, allowed), R pos3 (original R pos2, allowed), U pos4 (new), E pos5 (✓). This satisfies all constraints.

So guess “ACRUE”.

- Position 3 is R (✓ from guess 2).
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3, so it must be position 2.
