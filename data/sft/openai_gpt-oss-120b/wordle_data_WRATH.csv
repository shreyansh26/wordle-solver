### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be position 4.
Thus the pattern is _ R A T _.

All letters marked x are not in the word: C, N, E, G, S, P, I, L, D, F. Remaining possible letters include B, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern _RAT_ with only allowed letters is **WRATH** (W‑R‑A‑T‑H). Both W and H have not been eliminated yet.

So the next guess should be WRATH.
