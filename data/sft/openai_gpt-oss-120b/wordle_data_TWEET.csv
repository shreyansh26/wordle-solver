### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is present, but it is not in the fifth position. For the next guess I should include E in a different position and use new letters that have not been ruled out. A good candidate is **BLESS**: it places E in the third slot and introduces B, L, S (none of which have been excluded).

We know from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, L, S are not in the word.
- The letter E is in the word and correctly placed at position 3 (the middle spot).

Thus the secret word has the pattern _: _ E _ _.  
We need a new word that keeps E in the third position and introduces only letters that have not been ruled out.  
A good candidate is **TW E E D**:
- T, W, and D have not been excluded.
- It keeps E in the third slot.
- It also tests an additional E in another position, which is allowed.

Therefore the next guess will be “tweed”.

From the feedback:
- T is correct at position 1.

- E is correct at positions 3 and 4.
- D is not in the word.
All other letters previously guessed (C,R,A,N,B,L,S) are also not in the word.

Thus the pattern is T W E E _. The only plausible common English word fitting this pattern is **TWEET**, which places another T in the final position. No contradictions with earlier exclusions, so this is the next logical guess.
