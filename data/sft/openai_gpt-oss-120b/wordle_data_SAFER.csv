### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- S is correct and in the first position.
- L and T are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret pattern is: S _ _ _ _.  
We need to place A somewhere other than the 3rd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot. A good way to test both letters while introducing new possibilities is to use a word that puts A and E in different positions, e.g., putting E in the 3rd slot (allowed) and A in the 4th slot (allowed). ""SHEAR"" does exactly that and also brings in new letters H and R for further clues.
