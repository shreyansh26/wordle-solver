### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): all letters absent → eliminate C,R,A,N,E.
- Guess 2 (SHOUT): all letters absent → eliminate S,H,O,U,T.
- Guess 3 (BLIMP): B,X; L is in the word but not at position 2; I is in the word but not at position 3; M,X; P,X.
- Guess 4 (LIVID):
  * L at position 1 → “-”, so L is in the word but not at position 1 (now L cannot be 1 or 2).
  * I at position 2 → “✓”, so I is definitely at position 2.
  * V at position 3 → “x”, V not in the word.
  * I at position 4 → “-”, meaning I appears elsewhere (so the word contains at least two I’s, or the game marks any extra I as present elsewhere).  
  * D at position 5 → “-”, so D is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain:
- L (not in positions 1 or 2)
- I (definitely in position 2; possibly a second I elsewhere)
- D (somewhere except position 5)

All letters already ruled out: C,R,A,N,E,S,H,O,U,T,B,M,P,V.

Remaining possible letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, W, X, Y, Z (and also maybe others like F, G, J, K, Q, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a real 5‑letter English word satisfying the position constraints. One good candidate is **DILLY**:

- D is at position 1 (allowed, not position 5).
- I is at position 2 (✓).
- L is at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2).
- L at position 4 is fine.
- Y at position 5 is a letter not yet eliminated.

All letters (D, I, L, Y) are from the allowed set, and the word respects the known constraints. It will test the remaining possibilities for the second I and the other letters.

Thus the next guess will be **DILLY**.
