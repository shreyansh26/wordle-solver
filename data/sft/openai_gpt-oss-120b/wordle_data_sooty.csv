### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H are not in the word.
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 5 (it was at position 5 in ""MIGHT"" and got a “-”).

Thus the secret word must contain T somewhere in positions 1‑4, and the other four letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Choosing a word with five new, allowed letters will give the most information. “BLOTS” uses B, L, O, T, S—none of which have been eliminated, and places T in position 4, satisfying the requirement that T is not in position 5.

Therefore the next guess is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letter S is present (we already placed it at 1); the S in BLOTS was marked “-”, meaning it’s elsewhere, which matches position 1.
- Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H, B, L, P, U, and also any other letters marked x in guesses.

Remaining viable letters for the unknown slots (positions 2 and 5) are among: D, F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly repeats of already‑known letters (S, O, T) if the secret contains duplicates.

We need a common English word matching the pattern **S ? O T ?**. 
A suitable candidate is **SWOTS** (plural of the verb “to SWOT”). It fits the pattern:
- S at position 1
- W (a still‑untried letter) at position 2
- O at position 3
- T at position 4
- S at position 5 (testing whether the word contains a second S)

This guess will confirm whether the second letter is W and whether a second S exists, while keeping all known letters in their correct spots.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H are not in the word.
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 5 (it was at position 5 in ""MIGHT"" and got a “-”).

Thus the secret word must contain T somewhere in positions 1‑4, and the other four letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Choosing a word with five new, allowed letters will give the most information. “BLOTS” uses B, L, O, T, S—none of which have been eliminated, and places T in position 4, satisfying the requirement that T is not in position 5.

Therefore the next guess is:

- O is correct at position 3 (from BLOTS).
- T is correct at position 4 (from BLOTS and earlier clue that T is not in position 5).
- S is in the word but not at position 5 (feedback “S(-)”).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ O T _, with S occupying either position 1 or 2.

To get more information we can guess a word that places S at position 1, puts a new letter at position 2, keeps O and T in their known spots, and puts another new letter at position 5. “SPOUT” fits this: S P O U T. It tests a new letter P at position 2 and U at position 4 (which we know should be wrong, confirming T’s location), and also checks T at position 5 (which should be marked as present but wrong). This will help pinpoint the exact letters for positions 1 and 2.
