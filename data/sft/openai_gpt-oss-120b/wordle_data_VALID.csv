### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is present but not in the third position (since we got a “-”). Therefore our next guess must include A in a different slot and avoid the excluded letters. Choosing a common word with A in another position, such as “ALBUM”, satisfies these constraints: A is first, L, B, U, M are all letters we haven't ruled out.

We have feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, N, E are not in the word; A is present but not in position 3.
- From ALBUM: B, U, M are not in the word; A is present but also not in position 1; L is present but not in position 2.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters A and L, with the following position restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- L cannot be in position 2.

All other letters used so far (C, R, N, E, B, U, M) are ruled out.

Looking for a common 5‑letter word that includes A and L respecting those positions, while avoiding the excluded letters, leads to **SALTY**:
- Positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) T(4) Y(5)
- A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), and none of the forbidden letters appear.

Hence SALTY is a valid next guess.

""VALID"" fits perfectly: V A L I D uses only allowed letters (V, I, D) and matches the known positions. It is a common English word, making it an excellent next guess.
