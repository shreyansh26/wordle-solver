### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter in CRANE).

Thus the next guess must:
1. Exclude C, R, N, E.
2. Include A in a position other than the 3rd.

Choosing a common word that meets these constraints helps to discover more letters. “SALTY” fits:
- Contains A in the 2nd position (different from the 3rd).
- Uses only letters S, L, T, Y besides A, none of which have been ruled out yet.

So the next guess will be “SALTY”.

From the feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 2.
- O is confirmed at position 5.
- T is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from previous hints), leaving position 1 as the only possibility. So T is at position 1.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, P, I, plus any others marked x.

Thus the pattern is **T A _ _ O**. The remaining two letters must be unused and not among the eliminated ones. A common English word fitting this pattern is **TABOO** (T A B O O), which respects all known constraints.
