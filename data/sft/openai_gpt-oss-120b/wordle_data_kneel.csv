### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N and E are in the secret word but are not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”: N is not 4th, E is not 5th.

I need a new guess that includes N and E in different positions, avoids C, R, A, and introduces new letters to gather more information. “TOKEN” places E at position 4 (allowed) and N at position 5 (allowed), and adds T, O, K for testing.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, T, O are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 4.
- N is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- K is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word with:
- E at the 4th slot.
- N somewhere in positions 1‑3 (but not 4 or 5).
- K somewhere other than position 3 (could be 1, 2, or 5).
- No C, R, A, T, O.

“KNEEL” fits all these constraints:
- K at position 1 (not 3), N at position 2 (allowed), E at positions 3 and 4 (position 4 matches the known E), and L at position 5 introduces a new letter.
Thus it is a valid next guess.
