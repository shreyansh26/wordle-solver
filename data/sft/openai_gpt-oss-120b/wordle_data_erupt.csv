### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowel placements, which will give me the most information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular starting guess in Wordle because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

- Letters C, A, N, T, I, D, F, S, H are not in the word.

So the pattern is **E R _ _ _**.  
We need a common five‑letter word starting with “ER” that uses only letters not eliminated.  
“ERROR” fits: E R R O R. It places E at 1, R at 2, introduces a new letter O (still possible), and uses only allowed letters.
Thus “ERROR” is a logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined that the secret word starts with **E R**:
- Position 1 = E (only possible place for E after eliminating positions 3‑5).
- Position 2 = R (green in every guess).

Eliminated letters from previous guesses: A, C, N, T, I, D, F, S, H, O, plus any duplicates of R beyond the one at position 2.

Remaining possible letters for positions 3‑5 are: B, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common five‑letter word beginning with “ER” that uses only these remaining letters. A suitable candidate that tests several new letters is **ERBLY** (using B, L, Y, which have not been tried yet). This guess will confirm or eliminate those letters and help pinpoint the exact word.
