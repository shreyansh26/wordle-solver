### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess of a common five‑letter English word. Choosing a word with a mix of common consonants and vowels will give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” contains the frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, which should provide a good spread for the first feedback.

We know from the feedback:
- C is correct at position 1.
- R, A, N are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (R≠2, A≠3, N≠4).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word must start with C and contain R, A, N elsewhere.  
A plausible arrangement is C A R ? N, which satisfies all positional constraints (R is not in position 2, A not in 3, N not in 4). Adding an O in the fourth spot gives the valid English word “CARON” (a known term for a diacritic). This fits all the clues, so we’ll guess that.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 5: N (✓)

R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, and from the second guess we know it isn’t at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

Thus the pattern is C A _ R N. The common English word that fits this pattern is **CAIRN**.
