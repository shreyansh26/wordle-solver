### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A is correct in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 5.
- E is not in the word.

I need a new 5‑letter word that keeps A in the third slot, includes C (not at position 1) and avoids R and E. “SCAMP” fits: S C A M P (C is in position 2, A stays in position 3, no R/E). This will test C’s placement while respecting all known constraints.

We have gathered constraints:

- Position1 is S (from SCAMP, S ✓).
- Position3 is A (from both CRANE and SCAMP, A ✓).
- Letter C is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 (C was - in both guesses). So C must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (N was - in CRANE). So N can be in position 2 or 5 (position1 is S, position3 is A).
- Excluded letters: R, E, M, P.
- Remaining unknown slot(s) need a letter not yet ruled out.

A word satisfying all known placements is **SNACK**:
- S at position1 (fixed).
- N at position2 (allowed for N).
- A at position3 (fixed).
- C at position4 (allowed for C).
- K at position5 (new letter, not excluded).

Thus SNACK obeys all feedback and tests the final unknown letter K.
