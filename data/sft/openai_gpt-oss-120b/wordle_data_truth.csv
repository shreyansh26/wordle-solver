### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. I’ll choose a common word that covers a variety of common letters and vowel placement to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter: it contains two common consonants (C,R) and both a common vowel (A) and another vowel (E). This should give me useful feedback for the next steps.

We have the following confirmed letters from feedback:
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)
- Position 5: H (✓)

Letters ruled out: B, C, A, N, E, G, I, L, P, O, D, S, (and also any previously marked x).  

The pattern is _ R U _ H.  
We need a common English word fitting this pattern using only letters not eliminated.  

""TRUTH"" fits perfectly:  
- T (position 1) is not eliminated.  
- R (position 2) is correct.  
- U (position 3) is correct.  
- T (position 4) is allowed (T hasn't been ruled out).  
- H (position 5) is correct.  

Thus ""TRUTH"" is a valid next guess.
