### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess “crane”, only the last letter E was correct and all other letters (C, R, A, N) are not in the secret word at any position. Therefore:

We have determined the secret word pattern is **__DGE**:
- Position 3 = D (✓ from “fudge” and “midge”)
- Position 4 = G (✓ from “fudge” and “midge”)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from all guesses)

All letters guessed in positions 1 or 2 so far have been marked x:
- Eliminated letters: A, C, F, I, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, U, and also the earlier guesses gave x for C, R, A, N, S, L, O, P, F, U, M, I.
- Remaining unused letters that could occupy positions 1 and 2 are therefore: B, D, E, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since D, G, E are already fixed in positions 3‑5, the only plausible English words fitting **__DGE** with new letters are:
- **HEDGE** (H E D G E)
- **WEDGE** (W E D G E)

Both introduce a fresh first letter (H or W) and repeat E in position 2, which we have not yet tested. Choosing one will tell us both the correct first letter and whether the second letter is E.

I'll guess **WEDGE** to test W in the first slot and E in the second slot.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
