### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:

From feedback:

- S is correct in position 1.
- L and E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains A (not at position 3) and T (not at position 4).
3. Does not contain L or E.

The word **SATIN** satisfies all conditions:
- Starts with S.
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- T is at position 3 (allowed, since T was only excluded from position 4).
- No L or E present.

Thus, “SATIN” is a logical next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- S is correct at position 1.
- A and T are both in the word but not in the positions they were guessed.
From feedback:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (guessed at pos3 in guess1 and pos2 in guess2). So A must be in position 4 or 5.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (guessed at pos4 in guess1 and pos3 in guess2). So T must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a word starting with S, containing A and T in those allowable spots, and avoiding letters known to be absent (L, E, I, N). 

A viable pattern is S‑T‑‑A‑?, i.e., A at position 4 and T at position 2. The word **STRAW** fits:
- Position 1 S (fixed)
- Position 2 T (allowed)
- Position 3 R (new letter, not excluded)
- Position 4 A (allowed)
- Position 5 W (new letter, not excluded)

All conditions are satisfied, so we guess ""STRAW"".

A valid English word fitting the pattern S T _ A _ without using eliminated letters is **STOAS** (plural of “stoa”). It uses O (new) at position 3 and repeats S at position 5, both allowed.

Thus the next guess should be “stoas”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
