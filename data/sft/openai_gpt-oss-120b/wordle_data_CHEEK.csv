### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to gather useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the vowels A and E and the consonants C, R, N, which appear frequently in English words. This will give me a solid basis for the first round of feedback.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct). R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Therefore our next guess should:
- Start with C.
- Exclude R, A, N.
- Include E somewhere other than the last slot.

A good common word meeting these criteria is ""CHIEF"" (C H I E F), where E is in position 4. It also introduces new letters H, I, and F for further clues.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → C is correct (position 1), R, A, N are not in the word, E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 2: CHIEF → C is correct (position 1), H is correct (position 2), I is not in the word, E is correct (position 4), F is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **C H _ E _**.  
Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, I, F.  
We still need to determine the letters for positions 3 and 5.

A good candidate that fits the pattern, introduces new letters, and respects the exclusions is **CHEEK** (C H E E K).  
- Position 3 would be E (allowed; we haven’t ruled it out).  
- Position 5 would be K (a new letter to test).

This guess will tell us whether the third letter is indeed E and whether K is present.
