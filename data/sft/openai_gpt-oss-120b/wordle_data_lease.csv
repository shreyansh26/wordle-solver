From the first feedback:
- A is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 5.
- S and L are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

So the pattern is: _ _ A _ E, with S and L needing to occupy the remaining spots (positions 1,2,4) but not their original spots. A word that fits these constraints is **LEASE** (L at 1, S at 4, with the required A and E). This also introduces a new letter (E in position 2) to test.
