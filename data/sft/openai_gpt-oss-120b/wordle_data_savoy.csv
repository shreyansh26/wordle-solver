We know:
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- Position 5 is Y (✓).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, M, H, P, J, Z, plus any others marked x.
Thus the secret word fits pattern _ A _ _ Y using only letters that have not been eliminated. Possible letters include D, F, G, I, K, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, etc.

A good candidate that introduces several new letters is **GAWKY** (G A W K Y), which fits the pattern and uses only unused letters.

This guess will test G, W, K in positions 1,3,4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
