# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that uses only letters not yet ruled out. “SHOUT” contains S, H, O, U, and T, all of which are still possible, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

We have:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From SHOUT: S,H,O,T are not in the word; U is in the word but not in position 4.
Thus the secret word must contain U in position 1,2,3, or 5, and no other letters from the eliminated set.
Remaining possible letters are B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U.
We need a common 5‑letter word using only these letters and containing U (not fourth).
“BUILD” (B U I L D) fits: all letters are allowed and U is in position 2, which is permissible.
