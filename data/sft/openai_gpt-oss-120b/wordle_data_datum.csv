### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good opener because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both a vowel and several frequent consonants.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next guess must include A (but not in position 3) and avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll try a word that introduces new letters while satisfying these constraints. “ALBUM” fits: A is in position 1, and the other letters L, B, U, M are all unused and allowed.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,N,E are not in the word; A is present but not in position 3.
- From ALBUM: A is present but not position 1; L,B are not in the word; U is correct at position 4; M is correct at position 5.

Thus we know the secret word fits the pattern: ? A ? U M, with U at 4, M at 5, A at position 2 (since it cannot be 1 or 3). The remaining letters (positions 1 and 3) must be letters not excluded (C,R,N,E,L,B) and can be any other letters.

A common English word fitting ""? A ? U M"" is **DATUM** (D A T U M). D and T have not been ruled out, so this is a viable guess.

Thus the next guess is ""DATUM"".
