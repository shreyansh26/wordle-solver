### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that the secret word has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position, and it does not contain C, R, or A anywhere. So the pattern is ___NE. I’ll choose a common word matching that pattern and introducing new letters to gather more information. “STONE” fits (S, T, O are not ruled out) and follows the required ___NE pattern.

We have the pattern S ? O N E with the following known information:
- Position 1 = S (correct)
- Position 2 = unknown, but T is not in the word; also C, R, A are excluded.
- Position 3 = O (correct)
- Position 4 = N (correct)
- Position 5 = E (correct)

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching S?ONE. The viable candidate is **SHONE** (S‑H‑O‑N‑E). The letter H has not been ruled out yet, so this guess will test the second position.
