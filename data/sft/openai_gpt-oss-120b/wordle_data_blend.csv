### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is correct and in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word must have the form _ _ _ N _. It must contain an E somewhere in positions 1‑3, and must avoid C, R, A. A good candidate that fits these constraints is **BLENT** (B L E N T): N is fourth, E is third, and none of the forbidden letters appear.

We have determined that the secret word's first four letters are B L E N in that exact order, based on the feedback:
- B, L, E, N are all correct and placed correctly.
- T is not in the word.
- Letters C, R, A are also not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is B L E N _. We need a common English word fitting this pattern with a fifth letter that hasn't been ruled out. ""BLEND"" (B L E N D) satisfies all conditions and uses a new letter D, which hasn't been eliminated. Therefore, the next guess should be ""BLEND"".
