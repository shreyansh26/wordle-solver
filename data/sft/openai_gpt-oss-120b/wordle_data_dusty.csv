### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback from first guess:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- T is correct and is in position 4.

So the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ _ T _. It must contain an S somewhere other than the first position, and cannot contain L, A, or E.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **MINTS**:

We know:

- S is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5 (from both guesses), so S must be at position 2 or 3.
- Letters eliminated: L, A, E, M, I, N.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ T _, containing S at position 2 or 3 and using only letters not yet ruled out.

“RUSTY” fits:
- Pattern R U S T Y → S is at position 3, T at position 4.
- Uses new letters R, U, Y (none are eliminated).
Thus it will test those letters while respecting all constraints.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined from feedback:
- Position 4 is T (confirmed).

- Position 3 is S (confirmed).
- Position 5 is Y (confirmed).
- Position 1 is still unknown, but cannot be R (eliminated), nor any letters already marked absent (L, A, M, I, N, R, etc.).
The pattern is _ U S T Y. Viable English words fitting this pattern are **BUSTY** and **GUSTY**. Both use a new first letter that hasn't been ruled out. I’ll choose **BUSTY** for the next guess.

We have determined the secret word matches pattern _ U S T Y. Positions 2‑5 are confirmed as U, S, T, Y. Position 1 cannot be R, B, L, A, E, M, I, N, or any other letters marked absent previously. The remaining viable English words fitting ""?USTY"" are DUSTY and GUSTY (D and G have not been eliminated). I’ll guess DUSTY to test the remaining option.
