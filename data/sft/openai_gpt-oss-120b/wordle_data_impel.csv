### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus our next guess must avoid C, R, A, N entirely and place E somewhere other than the fifth slot. A good candidate is **SMELT**:
- Contains letters S, M, L, T which we haven’t tested yet.
- Places E in the third position, satisfying the “wrong position” rule.

We have established constraints:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, T are not in the word.
- M is correct at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at positions 3 or 5 (so could be 1 or 4).
- L is in the word but not at position 4 (so could be 1, 3, or 5).

We need a 5‑letter word with M in the second slot, containing both E and L in allowed positions, and avoiding the excluded letters. The word **IMPEL** fits:
- Pattern I M P E L → M is at position 2.
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- L is at position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus IMPEL is a valid next guess.
