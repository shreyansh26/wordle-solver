# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x) → C, A, N, E are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Guess 2 (RUSHY): R(-), U(x), S(-), H(x), Y(x) → U, H, Y are out; S is in the word but not in position 3.
- Guess 3 (SWORD): S(✓), W(x), O(x), R(-), D(x) → S is confirmed at position 1; R is in the word but not in position 4; W, O, D are out.
- Guess 4 (STRIP): S(✓), T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(-) → R is confirmed at position 3, I at position 4; T is out; P is in the word but not at position 5.

From this we know the exact layout so far:
1️⃣ S 2️⃣ ? 3️⃣ R 4️⃣ I 5️⃣ ?

The only remaining unknown slot is position 2, and P must occupy it (since P is present but not in position 5). Thus the pattern is **S P R I ?**.

The only common English word fitting this pattern and using letters not yet eliminated is **SPRIG** (S P R I G). G has not been ruled out, so this is a valid next guess.
