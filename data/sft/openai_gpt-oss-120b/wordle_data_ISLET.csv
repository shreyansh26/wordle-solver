### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. The letter E is present but not in the fifth position. Therefore the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N entirely and place E somewhere other than position 5. Choose a common word with E in the middle to test new letters.

Guess 2: SHEDS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) E(-) D(x) S(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From SHEDS: H and D are not in the word; S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5; E is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, H, D.
- The secret word contains E and S.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5; possible positions for E are 1, 2, or 4.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 5; possible positions for S are 2, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should place E and S in allowable spots and introduce new letters to test.  
The word **FEIST** fits:
- Positions: F 1, E 2, I 3, S 4, T 5.
- E is at position 2 (allowed), S at position 4 (allowed).
- All other letters (F, I, T) have not been tried yet and are not among the forbidden set.

Therefore, the next guess is FEIST.

- From SHEDS: H and D are not in the word; S is present but not in positions 1 or 5.

- From UPSET: U and P are not in the word; E is correct at position 4; S is present but not at position 3; T remains correct at position 5.

Putting this together:
- Position 5 = T
- Position 4 = E
- Position 2 = S (the only remaining place for S)
- Position 1 cannot be A, C, D, F, H, I, N, P, R, U (all marked “x”)
- Position 3 cannot be A, C, D, F, H, I, N, P, R, U, S (S already placed)

Thus the pattern is **_ S _ E T**. The only common English word that fits this pattern is **ASSET**, which would require the first letter to be A. Although A was previously marked “x” in the first guess, it’s possible that the earlier feedback contained an error. To resolve the ambiguity, we should test the remaining plausible word.

Therefore, I will guess **ASSET**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

- Position 2 = S (confirmed).
- I is present and cannot be in position 3; the only remaining open slot is position 1, so I must be at position 1.

- From SHEDS: H and D are absent; S is present but not in positions 1 or 5; E is present but not in position 3.
- From FEIST: F is absent; E is present (still not position 2); I is present but not position 3; S is present (still not position 4); T is correct at position 5.
- From UPSET: U and P are absent; S is present but not position 3; E is correct at position 4; T is correct at position 5.
- From ASSET: A is absent; S is correct at position 2; the second S is present elsewhere; E and T remain correct at positions 4 and 5.

Combining these:
- Position 5 = T (confirmed).
- Position 4 = E (confirmed).
- Position 2 = S (confirmed).
- I is present and cannot be in position 3; the only remaining open slot is position 1, so I must be at position 1.
- The remaining unknown slot is position 3; it must be a letter not yet ruled out. The common word fitting the pattern I S ? E T is **ISLET**, with L in position 3, which satisfies all constraints and uses only letters not marked absent.

Thus the next logical guess is ISLET.",Guess 6: ISLET -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) S(✓) L(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
