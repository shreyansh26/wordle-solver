### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C and E are not in the word.
- R, A, and N are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (R not 2nd, A not 3rd, N not 4th).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, N in different positions and introduces new letters to test. “RADON” fits:
- R is 1st (different from position 2),
- A is 2nd (different from position 3),
- N is 5th (different from position 4),
- It adds D and O for new information,
- It contains no C or E.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters C and E are not in the word.
- Letters D and O are not in the word.
- Letter N is correct in position 5.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible layouts:
1. A _ R _ N  (A at 1, R at 3)
2. _ _ R A N  (R at 3, A at 4)
3. A _ _ R N  (A at 1, R at 4)

We need a common English word that satisfies one of these patterns using only letters not yet ruled out (B F G H I J K L M P Q S T U V W X Y Z plus A, R, N).  

The word **AURYN** fits pattern 1:
- Position 1 = A (allowed)
- Position 2 = U (new, allowed)
- Position 3 = R (allowed, not in 1 or 2)
- Position 4 = Y (new, allowed)
- Position 5 = N (confirmed)

It contains no prohibited letters (C, D, E, O) and satisfies all positional constraints, making it a strong candidate.

Thus the next guess will be **AURYN**.

- C and E are not in the word.
- R, A, and N are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (R not 2nd, A not 3rd, N not 4th).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, N in different positions and introduces new letters to test. “RADON” fits:
- R is 1st (different from position 2),
- A is 2nd (different from position 3),
- N is 5th (different from position 4),
- It adds D and O for new information,
- It contains no C or E.

Thus “RADON” is a valid next guess.

Guess 2: RADON -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(-) O(-) N(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters C and E are not in the word.
- Letters D and O are not in the word.
- Letter N is correct in position 5.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible layouts:
1. A _ R _ N  (A at 1, R at 3)
2. _ _ R A N  (R at 3, A at 4)
3. A _ _ R N  (A at 1, R at 4)

We need a common English word that satisfies one of these patterns using only letters not yet ruled out (B F G H I J K L M P Q S T U V W X Y Z plus A, R, N).  

The word **AURYN** fits pattern 1:
- Position 1 = A (allowed)
- Position 2 = U (new, allowed)
- Position 3 = R (allowed, not in 1 or 2)
- Position 4 = Y (new, allowed)
- Position 5 = N (confirmed)

It contains no prohibited letters (C, D, E, O) and satisfies all positional constraints, making it a strong candidate.

Thus the next guess will be **AURYN**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
