I need to start the word-guessing game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess in such games is “CRANE” because it contains frequently used letters and covers a range of vowels and consonants.

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C, R, and E in different positions from those ruled out, and avoids A and N.  
The word **SCREW** satisfies:
- C at position 2 (allowed),
- R at position 3 (allowed),
- E at position 4 (allowed, not position 5),
- No A or N present.

Thus it is a good next guess.
