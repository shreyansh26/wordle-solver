### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A common opening word in many word-guessing games is ""CRANE"" because it contains frequently used letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the hidden word contains C, R, A, and E, each in a different position than guessed, and no N. I need a new 5‑letter word using those letters (and possibly a new one) that respects the position restrictions.  
“RACES” (R‑A‑C‑E‑S) satisfies all constraints:
- R is not in position 2 (it’s in position 1) – ok.
- A is not in position 3 (it’s in position 2) – ok.
- C is not in position 1 (it’s in position 3) – ok.
- E is not in position 5 (it’s in position 4) – ok.
- No N appears.

Thus “RACES” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- R is correct at position 1 (✓).
- C is correct at position 3 (✓).
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (‑).
- E is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5 (‑ from both guesses).
- Letters N and S are not in the word (x).

Thus the secret word has the pattern:
1 R, 2 E (the only remaining slot for E), 3 C, with A placed in either position 4 or 5, and the final letter being something other than N or S.

A common word fitting this pattern is **RECAP** (R‑E‑C‑A‑P), which respects all constraints.
