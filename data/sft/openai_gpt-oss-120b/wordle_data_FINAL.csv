### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have:
- N confirmed at position 3 (✓).
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3 (from feedback A(-) in CRANE, MANGO, AUNTS). So A must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, E, M, G, O, U, T, S.
- Remaining possible letters: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5‑letter word pattern __N__ with A at position 4 or 5.
A candidate that fits all constraints and introduces new letters is **KINDA**:
- K (new), I (new), N (correct at position 3), D (new), A (at position 5, allowed).
All letters are permitted, and the pattern matches the known constraints.

Current known constraints:
- Position 2 = I (✓)
- Position 3 = N (✓)
- Position 4 = A (‑ confirmed not at position5, so must be position4)
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown letters, must not be any previously eliminated letters (C,R,E,M,G,O,U,T,S,K,D).

We need a word of the form ? I N A ?. “FINAL” fits perfectly:
- F (new, not eliminated) at position1
- I at position2 (✓)
- N at position3 (✓)
- A at position4 (‑ confirmed)
- L (new, not eliminated) at position5

Thus “FINAL” satisfies all constraints and introduces two fresh letters (F and L) for more information.
