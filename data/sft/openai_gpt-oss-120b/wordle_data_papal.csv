### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- A is correct at position 2.
- L is in the word but not at positions 1,2,3 → must be at position 4 or 5.
- Another A exists (since the second A in guess 3 got a “-”), so the secret contains at least two As, one at position 2 and another elsewhere (not position 5).
- Excluded letters: S, T, E, B, M, Y, R, V, and also letters marked “x” in earlier guesses.
- Remaining viable letters include C, N, etc.

A word fitting all constraints is **CANAL**:
- Pattern C A N A L satisfies A at pos2, another A at pos4, L at pos5.
- Uses only new letters C and N, which haven’t been ruled out.
Thus this guess will test the remaining possibilities.

From the feedback we have determined the exact positions of three letters:
- A is correct at position 2.
- A is also correct at position 4.
- L is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ A _ A L.

All letters marked “x” in earlier guesses cannot appear anywhere in the word: S, T, E, B, M, Y, R, V, C, N, etc.  
We need a common English word matching the pattern and using only letters not yet excluded.

The word **PAPAL** fits:
- Pattern P A P A L matches the required positions.
- It uses only letters P, A, L, none of which have been eliminated.
- “Papal” is a standard English word.

Therefore the next guess is PAPAL.
