### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ E L L Y with known letters:
- Position 2: E (✓)
- Position 3: L (✓)
- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

The first letter cannot be any of the letters that have been marked x: C, R, A, N, S, H, F, G, B. Remaining common possibilities are J, T, or maybe D, M, P, etc., but the most common English words fitting the pattern are ""JELLY"" and ""TELLY"". ""JELLY"" is a very common word, so it is the best next guess.

Thus I will guess JELLY.
