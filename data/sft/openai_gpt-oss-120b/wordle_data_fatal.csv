### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, N, E, P, V, I, D are not in the word.
- The letter A is in the word and, according to guess 2 (PAVID), it is correctly placed at position 2.

So the secret word has the pattern **_ A _ _ _**, and must avoid all excluded letters (C,R,N,E,P,V,I,D).  

I’ll choose a word that keeps A in the second spot and introduces several new letters to test more possibilities: **JAZZY** (J, A, Z, Z, Y). None of these new letters have been ruled out yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

So the secret word has the pattern **_ A _ _ _**, and must avoid all excluded letters (C,R,N,E,P,V,I,D).

Remaining possible letters are: B, F, L, O, Q, T, W, X (and A already placed).

- Uses new letters B, O, T.
- Contains L (which we know is present) but not in the first position.
- Keeps A (the known correct letter) but in a different spot, which will confirm that A belongs only at position 2.

Thus “BLOAT” is a strategic next guess.
