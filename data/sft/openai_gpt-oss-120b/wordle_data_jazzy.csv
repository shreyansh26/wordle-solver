### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess (CRANE) I learned that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, N, or E. The letter A is present but is NOT in the third position. Therefore the secret word must have an A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and the remaining four letters must avoid C, R, N, and E.

A good next guess should:
- Include the confirmed letter A in a new position,
- Introduce several new, common letters not yet ruled out,
- Avoid the forbidden letters.

The word “AUDIO” fits these criteria: it contains A (now in position 1), and introduces U, D, I, O, none of which have been eliminated. This will give me information about both the placement of A and the presence of the new letters.

- Is a common 5‑letter English word.

The word **BALMY** fits:
- A is in position 2.
- Letters B, L, M, Y are all still possible.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus BALMY will give new information about the remaining letters and A’s exact placement.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is correct in position 2.
- Y is correct in position 5.
All other letters from previous guesses are eliminated: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, B, L, M, H, S, T.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ A _ _ Y** with the remaining unknown positions (1,3,4) using only letters that have not been ruled out: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter English word that matches the pattern and introduces new possible letters. A good candidate is **JAZZY**:
- Fits the pattern: J A Z Z Y
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (J, Z, Y)
- Introduces two new letters (J and Z) and repeats Z to test if the word contains one or two Z’s.

This guess will give us information about whether J and/or Z are in the secret word and will greatly narrow the remaining possibilities.
