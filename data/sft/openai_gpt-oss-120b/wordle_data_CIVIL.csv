### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and varied vowel placement to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a good initial guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and both a common vowel (A, E). This should give a solid base for feedback.

The feedback tells us that the first letter C is correct, and the letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all. So the secret word must start with C and cannot contain R, A, N, or E in any position. I need a new guess that starts with C and uses new letters to gather information. Choosing a word with common letters that haven’t been ruled out will be helpful. “CLOTH” fits: it starts with C, and introduces L, O, T, H, none of which have been tested yet and they don’t include any forbidden letters.

We know:
- Position 1 is C (confirmed).
- Letters R, A, N, E, O, T, H are not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

We need to place L in one of the remaining slots (3,4,5) and introduce new possible letters that haven't been ruled out. A good candidate is ""CIVIL"": 
- Starts with C.
- Places L at position 5 (testing L in a new slot).
- Introduces I and V, which are still possible letters.
This guess will tell us whether I or V belong in the word and also confirm L’s correct position.
