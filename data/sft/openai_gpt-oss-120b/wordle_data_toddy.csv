### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, L, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- T is in the word but not in the 4th position (which it occupied in SLATE).

So the next guess must:
1. Exclude S, L, A, E entirely.
2. Include the letter T, but place it in a different slot (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).

Choosing “MIGHT” satisfies these constraints:
- It contains T in the 5th position (different from the previous 4th position).
- It uses new letters M, I, G, H, none of which have been ruled out.
- All letters are common enough to give useful new information.

Thus “MIGHT” is a solid second guess.

Thus “MIGHT” is a solid second guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, E, M, I, G, H.
- The letter T is in the secret word but is not in position 4 (from SLATE) and not in position 5 (from MIGHT). Therefore T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

All remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones. Viable common letters left are B, C, D, F, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real English word containing T in one of the allowed positions and using only the allowed letters. “TRUNK” fits:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- Remaining letters R, U, N, K are all not eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
