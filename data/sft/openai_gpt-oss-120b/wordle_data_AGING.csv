### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- N is correct in position 4.
- I is correct in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be position 1 or 5.
- Letters C, R, E, F, T are not in the word.

Thus pattern: _ _ I N _. 
If A is position 1 we get A ? I N ?, e.g., **APING** (A‑P‑I‑N‑G), which uses only new letters not ruled out.
If A were position 5 we’d need a word like _ _ I N A, but common words fitting that pattern are scarce and often contain forbidden letters.

“APING” satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters P and G for further testing.

- Position 5: G (confirmed)

Only position 2 is unknown. The word pattern is **A _ I N G**.  
We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern, using a letter not yet ruled out.  
Possible candidates:
- **AWING** (A‑W‑I‑N‑G) – uses W, a letter we haven’t tested.
- **AGING** (A‑G‑I‑N‑G) – repeats G, which is possible but less informative.

Choosing **AWING** introduces a new letter (W) and will confirm the final unknown position.

Thus the next guess should be AWING.

We have deduced the pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: A (confirmed)
- Position 2: unknown, but W is not in the word.
- Position 3: I (confirmed)
- Position 4: N (confirmed)
- Position 5: G (confirmed)

Thus the secret word is A _ I N G, with the second letter not being any of the eliminated letters (C, R, E, F, T, P, W). The common word that fits this pattern is **AGING**, which places a G in the second position—a letter not yet ruled out and consistent with all previous clues.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""AGING"".
