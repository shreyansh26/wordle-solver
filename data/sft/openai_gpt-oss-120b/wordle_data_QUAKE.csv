### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position, and it does not contain the letters C, R, or N anywhere. Therefore the pattern is __A_E with the restrictions that C, R, N are excluded. A good candidate that fits this pattern and uses common letters is ""SLATE"" (S‑L‑A‑T‑E). None of its letters are among the excluded ones, so it’s a valid next guess.

We have confirmed that the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5. All other letters guessed (C,R,N,S,L,T) are not in the word at all. So the pattern is __A_E with allowed letters excluding those. Looking for a common word fitting that pattern, “QUAKE” (Q U A K E) uses only permissible letters and matches the pattern. This will test new letters Q, U, and K.
