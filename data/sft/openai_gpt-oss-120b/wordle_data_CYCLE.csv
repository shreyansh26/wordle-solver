# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- E is correct at position 5.
- L is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so L must be at position 3 or 4.
- Letters eliminated: S, A, T, U, N, G.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing L at position 3 or 4, and avoiding the eliminated letters.  
""RIFLE"" fits:
- Pattern R I F L E → L is in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters (S, A, T, U, N, G) appear.
- Introduces new letters R, I, F for more information.

Thus the next guess is ""RIFLE"".

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 1 is C (C✓ from guess 4).
- Position 4 is L and position 5 is E (from guess 3 and 4).
- Letters eliminated: S, A, T, U, N, G, R, I, F, O, B.
- L is only allowed at position 4, and E is fixed at position 5.

Thus the secret word has the pattern **C _ _ L E** with the middle two letters not among the eliminated set.  
A common English word fitting this pattern and avoiding all eliminated letters is **CYCLE** (C‑Y‑C‑L‑E). It introduces new letters Y and repeats C, both of which have not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “CYCLE”.
