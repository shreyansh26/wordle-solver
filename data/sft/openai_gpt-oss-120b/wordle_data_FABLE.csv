### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters: position 2 = A, position 3 = B, position 4 = L, position 5 = E. Position 1 is unknown but cannot be T (from TABLE feedback) and cannot be any letters previously marked x: C,R,N,P,U,S,W,I,V,T. Remaining possible letters include F, G, etc. The word pattern is _ A B L E. Valid English words fitting this pattern are ""FABLE"", ""GABLE"", ""CABLE"" (C excluded), ""SABLE"" (S excluded). Thus the possible solutions are FABLE or GABLE. I'll guess FABLE first.
