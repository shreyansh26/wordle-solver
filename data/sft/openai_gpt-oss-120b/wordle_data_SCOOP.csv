### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. It does not contain R, A, N, or E at all. I need a new guess that includes C in a different slot and avoids the excluded letters. I’ll choose a word with common letters and C placed elsewhere. “SLICK” puts C in the fourth position and uses letters (S, L, I, K) that haven’t been ruled out.

We need a valid English word starting with “SCO”. Common candidates:
- SCOOP (adds O in position 4, P in position 5) – both letters are still possible.
- SCOP? (needs a fifth letter, e.g., “SCOPS” with P and S) – also possible but “SCOPS” is less common.
Choosing the more common word “SCOOP” gives new letters O (again) and P to test position 4 and 5.
Thus guess “SCOOP”.
