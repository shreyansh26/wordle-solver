### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2) nor position 5 (from guess 1); therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letter P is correct in position 4.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ P _.  
E is either at position 1 or 2, and the remaining positions must use letters not yet ruled out (B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good candidate that respects all constraints and introduces new letters is **HEMPY** (H E M P Y).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed).  
- P is in the required position 4.  
- H, M, Y have not been tested yet.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

### Response Format:

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ E M P _.  
A common English word that matches this pattern is **KEMPT** (meaning neat or tidy). The only questionable letter is **T**, which was marked “x” in the second guess, but it’s possible that the feedback was mis‑interpreted or that a duplicate letter rule affected it. Trying **KEMPT** will confirm whether **T** can be part of the solution.

We have determined the exact positions of several letters:

- Position 2 = E (confirmed by guesses 2, 3, 4)
- Position 3 = M (confirmed by guesses 3, 4)
- Position 4 = P (confirmed by guesses 2, 3, 4)

Letter T has been marked “‑” (present but wrong spot) in guesses 2 and 4, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. The only remaining open positions are 1 and 5, and position 5 is ruled out, so T must be at position 1.

Thus the pattern is **T E M P _**.  
We need a common English word fitting that pattern with a fifth letter not yet eliminated (C,R,A,N,S,L,H,Y,K have been shown absent). “O” is still possible, giving the word **TEMPO**.

I will guess that.
