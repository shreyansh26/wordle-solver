### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starter is “SLATE” because it includes S, L, A, T, and E, which are among the most common letters in English and are all different, giving me the broadest possible coverage.

We know from the first guess:
- Letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at any position.
- Letter A is in the secret word but NOT in position 3 (the third slot of SLATE).

Therefore the next guess should:
1. Include the letter A, but place it in a different position (positions 1,2,4, or5).
2. Avoid using S, L, T, E.
3. Introduce new letters to test more possibilities.

A good candidate is **CARGO**:
- Contains A in position 2 (different from the previous guess).
- Uses new letters C, R, G, O which have not yet been ruled out.
- Contains no prohibited letters (S, L, T, E).

This will give us fresh information about the remaining letters.

From the feedback:
- C is correct at position 1.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 → possible positions 2, 4, 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 5 → possible positions 2, 3, 4.
- G, S, L, T, E are not in the word.

We need a guess that keeps C at the start, places A, R, O in allowed spots, and introduces a new letter to test the remaining unknown slot. “CROAK” does exactly that:
C (✓) at 1, R at 2, O at 3, A at 4, and a new letter K at 5.

This will confirm the positions of R, O, A and test whether K is part of the secret word.
