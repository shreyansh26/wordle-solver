### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in CRANE.
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E, avoids C and N, and places those known letters in different positions from the ones ruled out.

The word **RAVEL** fits:
- Contains R, A, E.
- Positions: R at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed).
- No C or N.

Thus, ""RAVEL"" is a valid next guess.

So far we know:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = E
- R must be at position 3 or 5
- Forbidden letters: C, N, V, L (and also any letters we have marked “x”).

A good candidate that respects all constraints is **MAKER**:
- Pattern _ A _ E _.  
- Contains R at position 5 (allowed).  
- Uses only letters not ruled out (M, K are new, A, E, R are confirmed).

Thus the next guess will be “MAKER”.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 4 = E (confirmed)
- Position 5 = R (confirmed)

Only the first letter is unknown, and it cannot be any of the letters already ruled out (C, N, V, L, M, K, W, plus R which is already used at the end). Viable common words fitting the pattern are **DATER**, **HATER**, **PATER**, etc. “HATER” uses a new letter H not yet excluded and is a common word likely in the allowed list.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
