### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R is correct in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Thus the secret pattern is: _ R _ _ _ with an E somewhere except the last slot, and without C, A, N.

- Position 2 is **R** (✓ in all guesses).
- Position 3 is **E** (E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5, so it must be in position 3).
- Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, A, N, B, I, F, U, P, T, and also the letters that were marked “x” in previous guesses.
- Remaining possible letters for the other slots are: D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that fits the pattern **_ R E _ _** using only allowed letters.  
A common English word that satisfies all conditions is **DRESS** (D‑R‑E‑S‑S), which uses only letters we have not ruled out.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 is **R** (green in every guess).
- Position 3 is **E** (the only possible spot after eliminating 1, 4, 5).
- Position 4 is **S** (green in the last guess).
- The second S in “DRESS” got a “-”, meaning the word contains another S somewhere other than position 5 – most likely at position 1, but the duplicate‑letter rule could also allow the word to have only one S.  
- Excluded letters (gray) are: C, A, N, B, I, F, U, P, T, D, and any letters not yet tested.

Thus the pattern is **_ R E S _**, with the first and last letters still unknown but cannot be any of the excluded letters.

To gather more information, I’ll guess a word that fits the known pattern and introduces a new letter in the first slot while keeping the last slot a letter we already know is not in the word (T). This will let us confirm whether the first letter is S or something else and also reconfirm that T is indeed absent.

The word **WREST** matches the pattern (_ R E S _), uses a new first letter **W**, and keeps **T** in the final position as a control.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
