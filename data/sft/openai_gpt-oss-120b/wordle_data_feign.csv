### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A. It does contain N and E, but N is NOT in position 4 and E is NOT in position 5 (from the feedback on “CRANE”). For the next guess we should place N and E in different positions than those, and introduce new letters to test possibilities while avoiding C, R, A.

A good candidate is **TUNED**:

- E correct at position 2 (from LEMON feedback)
- N correct at position 5 (from LEMON feedback)

All other letters tested so far (C, R, A, T, U, D, L, M, O) are not in the word.

We need a word of the form _ E _ _ N using only untapped letters.  
A common candidate is **SEVEN** (S E V E N). It places E and N in the known correct spots and introduces new letters S and V for testing.

We know the secret word pattern is _ E _ _ N with E in position 2 and N in position 5 confirmed. All other tested letters (C,R,A,T,U,D,L,M,O,S,V) are not in the word, and there is only one E (the extra E in SEVEN got a ""-"" indicating wrong position). So we need new letters for positions 1,3,4 from the remaining alphabet. A common English word fitting the pattern is **FEIGN** (F E I G N), using only previously untested letters F, I, G. This will test three new letters while respecting all known constraints.
