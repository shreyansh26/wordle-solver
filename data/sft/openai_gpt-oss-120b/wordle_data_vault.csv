### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a frequent starting guess in word‑guessing games because it includes frequently used consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This should give me useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first guess:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the next guess must contain A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E entirely. A word like “AUDIO” fits: it places A at position 1, introduces new letters U, D, I, O for testing, and contains none of the excluded letters.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, D, I, O.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from CRANE position 3 gave '-', and AUDIO position 1 gave '-').
- U is in the word but not in position 2 (from AUDIO position 2 gave '-').

We need a 5‑letter word that includes both A and U, avoids all excluded letters, and places them in allowed positions.

Consider the word **VAULT**:
- Positions: V(1) A(2) U(3) L(4) T(5)
- A is at position 2 (allowed), U is at position 3 (allowed).
- Remaining letters V, L, T have not been ruled out.

Thus VAULT satisfies all constraints and gives new information about other letters.
