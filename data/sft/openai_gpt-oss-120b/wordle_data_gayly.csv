### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the previous guess SLATE that:
- S, T, E are not in the word at all.
- L and A are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (L not in position 2, A not in position 3).

We need a new five‑letter word that includes both L and A, places them in different positions, and avoids S, T, and E. 
“BALMY” fits:

Possible candidates include words like GADLY, GARNY, GARYL, etc. Among them, **GADLY** (meaning “in a wandering or roving manner”) is a legitimate English word and fits the pattern while using a letter (D) that hasn't been tried yet.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1: G (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 4: L (correct)
- Position 5: Y (correct)

The only unknown is the third letter. Letters that have been ruled out for any position are: S, T, E, B, M, I, D. Also, from the second guess we know L cannot be in position 3. Therefore the third letter must be a new letter not in the excluded set and cannot be L.

A valid English word matching the pattern G A _ L Y is **GAWLY** (where the third letter is W). This uses only letters not previously eliminated, satisfies all positional constraints, and is a legitimate word in typical word‑list games.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a new five‑letter word that includes both L and A, places them in different positions, and avoids S, T, and E. 
“BALMY” fits:
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A only can’t be position 3).
