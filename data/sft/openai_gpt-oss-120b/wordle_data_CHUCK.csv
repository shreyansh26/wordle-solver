### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)

Positions 4 and 5 are unknown. Letters known NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, L, O, T, I, P, S, F. Letters still possible include D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, B, and also C (could appear again). Looking for a common English word matching the pattern CHU??. Candidates: CHUCK, CHUMP (P excluded), CHUNK (N excluded), CHURN (R/N excluded). CHUCK fits the pattern, uses only letters C, H, U, C, K—none of which are excluded, and introduces a new letter K to test.
Thus the next guess should be CHUCK.
