### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following:

- Position 2 = L (✓)
- Position 3 = U (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓)

All letters marked **x** are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, H, I, Y, F, O, D, B, T.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ L U N _** and can only use letters that have not been ruled out: G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus any not yet tried.

A common English word matching this pattern is **PLUNK** (P‑L‑U‑N‑K). Both P and K have not been eliminated, making it a valid next guess.
