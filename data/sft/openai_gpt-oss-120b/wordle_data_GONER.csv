### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Contains both N and R in allowed positions.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

- Required letters: R, N, O.
- From earlier feedback, R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 → thus N must be at position 3.
So the pattern is: _ O N _ _ with R in slot 4 or 5 and no forbidden letters.

A valid English word that fits is **DONOR** (D O N O R): O at 2, N at 3, R at 5, and all other letters are allowed.

- Therefore possible placements:
  * N can be in position 1 or 3.
  * R can be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- We need a 5‑letter English word fitting the pattern _ O _ _ _, containing both R and N, and using none of the excluded letters.

The word **NORTH** satisfies all constraints:
- Pattern: N (pos1) O (pos2) R (pos3) T (pos4) H (pos5)
- Contains both N and R in allowed positions.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

Thus the next guess should be NORTH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
