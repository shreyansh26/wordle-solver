### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since there is no prior information, I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information. “CRANE” is a good starter word because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

We have determined the confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = O (from guess 4, O was a ✓).
- Position 4 = S (from guess 4, S was a ✓).
- Position 5 = E (from all guesses, E is a ✓).

From previous guesses we know letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, G, L, I, D, T, V, P.  
Also, S cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3) and cannot be in position 3 (from guess 4). O cannot be in position 3 (from guess 3).

Thus the pattern is _ O _ S E, with allowed letters for the blanks being any that haven’t been ruled out. “HOUSE” fits perfectly:
- H is not excluded.
- O is already fixed at position 2.
- U is still possible.
- S is correctly at position 4.
- E is correct at position 5.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “HOUSE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E that includes both S and O, avoids the excluded letters, and respects the positional restrictions:
- S cannot be in slot 1.
- O cannot be in slot 3.

A common word that satisfies all these constraints is **POSSE**:
- P (allowed), O (allowed, placed in slot 2, not slot 3), S (allowed, placed in slots 3 and 4, not slot 1), E (correct in slot 5).
- No disallowed letters appear.

Thus “POSSE” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the exact pattern of the secret word:
- Position 2 = O (✓ from “posse” and “house”).
- Position 3 = U (✓ from “house”).
- Position 4 = S (✓ from “posse” and “house”).
- Position 5 = E (✓ from every guess).

Thus the word looks like **_ O U S E**.

All letters that have been ruled out (appear with “x”) are: C, R, A, N, G, L, I, D, T, V, P, H, and also S cannot be in position 1 (from earlier “-” feedback). The only common English word that fits the pattern and respects these restrictions is **MOUSE** (M is not excluded).
