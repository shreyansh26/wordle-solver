### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. The letter N is present but is NOT in the 4th position (the position it occupied in “crane”). Therefore, our next guess must include N in a different slot (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5) while avoiding the excluded letters. Choosing a word with common letters that satisfies these constraints gives us a good chance to learn more. “BUNKS” places N in the 3rd position and uses only letters not ruled out yet.

From the feedback:
- Only the letter N is confirmed to be in the word.

We have feedback:
- From guess 1 and 2, only N is known to be present; it is not in positions 3 (bun**k**s) nor 4 (cra**n**e).

  * N(-): N is in the word but not at position 1.
  * I(-): I is in the word but not at position 2.
  * G(✓): G is correct at position 3.
  * H(x): H is not in the word.
  * T(✓): T is correct at position 5.

Thus N must occupy position 2 (the only remaining slot), giving the pattern **_ N G _ T**.
I must be in the word but cannot be at position 2, so I can be at position 1 or 4.

Looking for a common English word matching **? N G ? T** with I in position 1 or 4 and using only letters not ruled out (C,R,A,E,B,U,K,S,H are excluded).  
The word **INGOT** fits perfectly:
- I N G O T → I at position 1, N at 2, G at 3, O at 4, T at 5.
- All letters are allowed, and the pattern satisfies the feedback.
