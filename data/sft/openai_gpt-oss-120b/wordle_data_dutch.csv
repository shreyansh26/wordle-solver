### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, A, E are not in the word. T is in the word but not in position 4.
- From TRICK: C is correct in position 4. T is in the word but not in position 1 (since it got a “-” at position 1). Therefore T must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.

All other letters guessed (R, I, K) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word has pattern: _ _ _ C _.  
T occupies position 2, 3, or 5.  
We need a new guess that keeps C at position 4, places T in one of the allowed spots, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is **BUTCH**:
- B, U, H have not been tried yet.
- T is at position 3 (allowed).
- C is at position 4 (confirmed).
- No prohibited letters are used.

This will test three new letters while respecting all constraints.

Thus the secret word has pattern: _ _ _ C _.  
T occupies position 2, 3, or 5.  
We need a new guess that keeps C at position 4, places T in one of the allowed spots, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is **BUTCH**:
- B, U, H have not been tried yet.
- T is at position 3 (allowed).
- C is at position 4 (confirmed).
- No prohibited letters are used.

This will test three new letters while respecting all constraints.

4. CUTCH → Position 2‑5 remain U, T, C, H (all ✓). Position 1 is C with “-”, meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. Since we already have a C at position 4, the “-” simply indicates the same C is elsewhere, so the word has only one C at position 4.

The first letter must be a letter not yet ruled out (not S, L, A, E, R, I, K, B, C). A common English word fitting this pattern is **HUTCH** (a small cage or cupboard).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have deduced the pattern from the feedback:

- Positions 2‑5 are confirmed as U, T, C, H respectively.
- The first letter is still unknown but cannot be any letters that have been marked absent: S, L, A, E, R, I, K, B, C (already at position 4), or H at position 1 (since it got a “-” meaning H is elsewhere, not at position 1).
- The possibilities for a valid English word matching _UTCH are limited. “HUTCH” would give a green at position 1, but the feedback for HUTCH showed a “-”, so the secret word is not HUTCH.
- The remaining common word fitting the pattern is **DUTCH** (D U T C H). This satisfies all previous feedback:
  - SLATE: T present, not at position 4.
  - TRICK: T present, not at position 1; C correct at position 4.
  - BUTCH, CUTCH, HUTCH all give the same feedback pattern with a “-” for the first letter, which is true for DUTCH (the first letter D is not among the guessed letters, but H and C appear elsewhere, yielding “-”).
- Therefore the next logical guess to confirm the solution is “DUTCH”.

The guess will test the first letter and should result in all correct positions.
