### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, O, S are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is correct in position 4.

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ T _. H must appear in position 2, 3, or 5. All other letters must avoid the excluded set. A plausible common word fitting these constraints is **BLITH** (B L I T H): it uses only allowed letters, places T in the fourth slot, and includes H at the fifth position.

2. HOSTS → H is in the word but not position 1; O, S are eliminated; T is correct at position 4.
3. BLITH → B, L eliminated; I is in the word but not position 3; T confirmed at position 4; H confirmed at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
- Position 4 = T
- Position 5 = H
- Contains I, but not in position 3 (so I must be in position 1 or 2)
- Contains H (already placed at 5) and T (already placed at 4)
- No letters C, R, A, N, E, O, S, B, L.

A common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints is **FIFTH**:
- F (allowed) I (position 2, satisfying the “I not in position 3”) F (allowed) T (position 4) H (position 5).

All letters are permissible and the known placements match. This makes it a strong next guess.
