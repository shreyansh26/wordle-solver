### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter: it uses frequent consonants S, L, T and the common vowels A, E. This should give a clear pattern for the first feedback.

From the first feedback:
- S, L, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and T, placed elsewhere. I’ll choose a word that includes A and T in new positions and avoids S, L, E. “PAINT” puts A in position 2 and T in position 5, satisfying the constraints and introduces new letters P, I, N for more information.

From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, P, I.
- A is correct at position 2.
- T is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be position 1 or 3.
- N is in the word but cannot be in position 4, so it can be 1, 3, or 5.

We need a word of the form _ A _ _ _. It must contain T and N in the allowed spots and avoid the excluded letters.  

The word **TANGO** fits:
- T at position 1 (allowed),
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct),
- N at position 3 (allowed),
- G and O are new letters not yet excluded,
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus “TANGO” satisfies all constraints and gives fresh letters to test.
