# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- Letters not in word: C, A, E, B, O, W.
- Letters in word: R (wrong position 2), N (wrong positions 4 and 5).
Thus R cannot be at position 2, N cannot be at positions 4 or 5.
We need a 5‑letter word containing both R and N, respecting those position constraints and avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **RINKS** satisfies:
- R is at position 1 (allowed), N at position 3 (allowed).

- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new allowable letters is **UNRIG**:

We have the following information:

- Letters known **not** to be in the word (marked x): C, A, E, B, O, W, K, S, U, G.
- Confirmed letters:
  * N is correct at position 2 (from UNRIG feedback).
  * R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, and also not position 3 (from previous “-” feedback). Thus R can only be in position 4 or 5.
  * I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, so I can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Because virtually every English 5‑letter word with N in the second slot begins with a vowel, and the only allowed vowel not eliminated is **I**, the first letter must be I.  
Thus the pattern is **I N _ _ _**, with R at position 4 or 5 and I occupying a remaining allowed slot.

A valid word fitting all constraints and using only letters not ruled out is **INDRI**:
- I (1) – allowed (I not in pos2/4)
- N (2) – fixed correct
- D (3) – new letter, not ruled out
- R (4) – allowed position for R
- I (5) – allowed (I not in pos2/4)

“INDRI” is an English noun (a type of lemur) and satisfies every piece of feedback received so far.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- Letters not in word: C, A, E, B, O, W.
- Letters in word: R (wrong position 2), N (wrong positions 4 and 5).
Thus R cannot be at position 2, N cannot be at positions 4 or 5.
We need a 5‑letter word containing both R and N, respecting those position constraints and avoiding the excluded letters.  
The word **RINKS** satisfies:
- R is at position 1 (allowed), N at position 3 (allowed).
- Contains only allowed letters (R, I, N, K, S) none of which are excluded.
Hence it is a suitable next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have identified the letters that must be in the secret word: R, I, N. All other letters guessed so far (C, A, E, B, O, W, K, S) are not in the word.

Position constraints:
- N cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 → N must be in position 1 or 2.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 2.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new allowable letters is **UNRIG**:
- Pattern: _ N _ _ _
- N is at position 2 (allowed).
- R is at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2).
- I is at position 4 (allowed, not 2).
- The additional letters U and G have not been ruled out.

Thus UNRIG is a valid next guess.

From guess INDRI, position 3 (D) was gray, and position 5 (I) was yellow, meaning there is another I somewhere else (not at position 5). Since position 1 already holds an I, the second I must be at position 3. Thus the pattern is:
