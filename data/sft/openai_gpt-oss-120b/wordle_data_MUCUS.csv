### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know the secret word includes the letter C, but not in the first position. Letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word. We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
- Contains C in a position other than the first.
- Avoids R, A, N, E.
Choosing a common word with C at the end gives us useful information about other letters. “MUSIC” fits: it places C in the fifth slot and introduces new letters M, U, S, I, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C is in the word but not at position 1. R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From MUSIC:  
  • M is correct at position 1 (✓)  
  • U is correct at position 2 (✓)  
  • S is in the word but not at position 3 (–)  
  • I is not in the word (x)  
  • C is in the word but not at position 5 (–)

Thus:
- Position 1 = M, position 2 = U (fixed).  
- C cannot be at positions 1, 2, 5 → possible positions 3 or 4.  
- S cannot be at position 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.  

If we place C at position 3 and S at position 5 we get the pattern **M U C _ S**.  
A common English word that fits this pattern and respects all excluded letters is **MUCUS** (M U C U S). It uses a second U at position 4, which is allowed because we have no information ruling out another U.

Therefore the next guess should be “MUCUS”.
