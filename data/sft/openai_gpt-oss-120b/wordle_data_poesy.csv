### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it tests two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This will give a good spread of feedback for the next guesses.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked 'x').
- E is in the secret word but not in the 5th position (marked '-').

So the next word must:
1. Exclude the letters C, R, A, N.
2. Contain the letter E somewhere other than the 5th position.

Choosing a common word that fits these constraints helps gather more information. “SHOES” meets all the criteria:
- No C, R, A, N.
- Contains E in the 4th position (different from the previous 5th‑position guess).
- Uses other frequent letters (S, H, O) to test more possibilities.
