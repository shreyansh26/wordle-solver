### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “crane” gave feedback that all five letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that uses none of those letters. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, T, all of which are permissible. This will give new information about the remaining letters.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, I, G are not in the secret word.
- Letters M, H, T are in the word but not in their guessed positions:
  * M is not at position 1.
  * H is not at position 4.
  * T is not at position 5.
We need a 5‑letter word containing M, H, T plus two other allowed letters, avoiding the forbidden letters and respecting the position restrictions.  
The word **THUMB** fits:
- Contains T, H, M plus U and B (both allowed).
- Positions: T at 1 (allowed, only restriction is not at 5), H at 2 (not 4), M at 4 (not 1).  
Thus it satisfies all known constraints and will give new information.

- From guess 1 (crane): C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From guess 2 (might): M, H, T are in the word but in different positions; I and G are not.
- From guess 3 (thumb): T is correct at position 1, H at position 2, U at position 3, M at position 4, and B is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must be **T H U M _**.  
The only letter still unknown is the fifth one. It cannot be any of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, G, B) and could be a new common letter. A very common English word fitting the pattern is **THUMP** (adding P, which has not been ruled out). This guess will confirm the final letter.

Therefore the next guess should be “thump”.
