### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. This will give me useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. A good starter word is ""SLATE"" because it includes the frequent letters S, L, T, plus the vowels A and E.

Feedback from first guess:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word starts with ""SL"". The remaining letters must include T and E, placed somewhere in positions 3‑5, respecting the position restrictions:
- T cannot be position 4.
- E cannot be position 5.

Possible placements:
- T at position 3, E at position 4 → pattern SLTE?.
- T at position 5, E at position 3 → pattern SLE?T.

The pattern SLE?T forms the common word ""SLEPT"", which satisfies all constraints:
- S (✓) L (✓) E (now in position 3, allowed) P (new letter) T (position 5, allowed).
This is a valid 5‑letter English word and uses the known letters correctly.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SLEPT"".

We have determined the secret word layout from feedback:

- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: L (correct)
- Position 3: E (correct)
- Position 5: T (correct)
- Position 4: unknown, but cannot be P (since P was marked absent) and must be a letter that forms a valid English word.

The pattern is S L E _ T. The common word that fits this pattern is **SLEET** (placing another E in position 4). This uses only letters we know are allowed and introduces no prohibited letters.

Thus the next guess should be ""SLEET"".
