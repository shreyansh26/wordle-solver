### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening guess that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowel placements to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter word because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

We know from the feedback:
- R is correct at position 2.
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word with R as the second letter, containing E (not at the last spot), and avoiding C, A, N. “TRIED” fits: T R I E D (R is second, E is fourth, no C/A/N). This will give us more information about the remaining letters.

We have the following confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)

Letters confirmed absent: C, A, N, I, D, plus any that were marked x.

Thus the secret word matches the pattern **T R _ E _**.

We need to test possible letters for positions 3 and 5 while respecting the exclusions. 
A good candidate that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **TRUER** (U at position 3, R repeated at position 5). This will tell us whether U belongs in the word and whether the final letter is R.
