### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that only the letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in the third position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all. So the next guess must:

- Include the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed:
- A is in the word, but not in positions 2,3,4. So A can be position 1 or 5.
- L is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So L can be position 1, 2, or 4.
- Excluded letters (x): C, R, N, E, B, M, Y, V, I, T.
- Remaining possible letters: A, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Z.

We need a 5‑letter word containing both A and L, respecting the position limits.  
A plausible candidate is **ALPHA**:
- A at position 1 (allowed) and L at position 2 (allowed).  
- Uses only allowed letters (P, H) besides A and L.

Thus we will guess “ALPHA”.

We have determined the exact positions for A and L:
- Position 1 is A (confirmed by a ✓).
- Position 2 is L (confirmed by a ✓).

All other letters guessed so far are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, M, Y, V, I, T, P, H.  
Thus the remaining three letters (positions 3‑5) must be chosen from the unused alphabet (D, F, G, J, K, O, Q, S, U, W, X, Z, etc.) and must not violate any known placement rules (L cannot be at position 3 or 5, but could be at 4; however we already have L at position 2, so we’ll avoid a second L for simplicity).

A common English word fitting the pattern **A L _ _ _** and using only allowed letters is **ALOOF**:
- Positions 3‑5 are O, O, F – all letters not previously ruled out.
- The word respects all placement constraints (L is not in a forbidden spot, A is not at any disallowed position).

Therefore the next guess is “ALOOF”.
