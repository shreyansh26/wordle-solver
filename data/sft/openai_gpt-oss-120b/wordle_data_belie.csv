### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter word. A good opening guess uses common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information quickly. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, “ROAST”, or “AUDIO” are popular choices. I’ll pick “CRANE” because it contains three frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), giving a balanced chance to receive useful feedback.

We have the following information:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) from both guesses.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, S, O, P** are not in the word at all.
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, contain an L somewhere except position 2. To learn more, we should try a word that:
- Ends with E,
- Places L in a new position (e.g., position 1),
- Introduces fresh letters that have not been ruled out.

The word **LITHE** satisfies these criteria:
- L is at position 1 (allowed),
- Introduces I, T, H (new letters),
- Ends with E (confirmed correct).

So the next guess will be **LITHE**.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) from both guesses.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, S, O, P** are not in the word at all.
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, contain an L somewhere except position 2. To learn more, we should try a word that:
- Ends with E,
- Places L in a new position (e.g., position 1),
- Introduces fresh letters that have not been ruled out.

The word **LITHE** satisfies these criteria:
- L is at position 1 (allowed),
- Introduces I, T, H (new letters),
- Ends with E (confirmed correct).

So the next guess will be **LITHE**.

- Secret word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters not in word: C, R, A, N, S, O, P, T, H.
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Letter I is in the word but not in position 2.
Thus the word pattern is _ _ _ _ E with L somewhere in position 3 or 4, I somewhere in position 1,3,or4 (but not 2), and no forbidden letters.

A word that satisfies all constraints is **EXILE**:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I (position 3) and L (position 4), respecting the positional restrictions.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (E, X, I, L).

Therefore the next guess should be EXILE.

We have the following information from the feedback:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) – confirmed by every guess.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, S, O, P, T, H, X** are not in the word at all.
- **L** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 → therefore **L** must be in position 3.
- **I** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → therefore **I** must be in position 4 (position 1 is still possible, but we’ll test the other option).
- There is a second **E** somewhere other than position 1 (the first E in “EXILE” was marked “–”). Since position 5 already holds an E, the additional E must be in position 2.

Putting these constraints together gives the pattern:
1 ?  2 E  3 L  4 I  5 E

The only common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **BELIE**.

Thus the next guess should be “BELIE”.
