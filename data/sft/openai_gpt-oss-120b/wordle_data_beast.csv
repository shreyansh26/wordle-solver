### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess in Wordle‑style games is “CRANE” because it contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. I’ll use that as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is correct at position 3.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the third slot, containing an E somewhere other than the fifth slot, and without C, R, or N.  
A suitable candidate is **DEALT** (D E A L T): it satisfies all constraints.

We have determined the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 2 is E (✓ from DEALT).
- Position 3 is A (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 5 is T (✓ from DEALT).
- Letters C, R, N, D, L are not in the word (x marks).
- E is not at position 5 (already satisfied).

Thus the word must fit the pattern _ E A _ T, using only letters not excluded. A common English word that matches is **BEAST** (B‑E‑A‑S‑T). It respects all constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore the next guess is BEAST.
