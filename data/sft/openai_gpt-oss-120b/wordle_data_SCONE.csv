### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Secret word ends with E (E is correct at position 5).
- S is in the word but not in position 4, so S can be 1,2, or 3.
- Letters A, R, I are not in the word at all.

Choose a word that respects these constraints, keeps E at the end, places S in a possible position, and introduces new letters to test. ""STOLE"" fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- Ends with E.
- Introduces T, O, L for new information.

A common English word fitting the pattern S?ONE with an allowable second letter is **SCONE** (a type of pastry). The second letter C has not been excluded yet, making this a valid candidate.
