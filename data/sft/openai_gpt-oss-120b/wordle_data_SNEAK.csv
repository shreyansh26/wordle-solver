### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback:
- C and R are not in the word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in (A not 3rd, N not 4th, E not 5th).

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E in different positions, avoids C and R, and tries new letters for the remaining spots. “EATEN” satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A, N, E.
- Positions: E (1), A (2), T (3), E (4), N (5) – none conflict with the prohibited positions.
- No C or R.

Thus I’ll guess “EATEN”.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, T.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  * A is in the word, but not in positions 2 (from guess 2) or 3 (from guess 1). So A can be 1, 4, 5.
  * E is in the word, but not in positions 1, 4, 5 (from both guesses). So E can be 2 or 3.
  * N is in the word, but not in positions 4 (guess 1) or 5 (guess 2). So N can be 1, 2, 3.

We need a real 5‑letter word using A, E, N in allowed spots and avoiding C, R, T elsewhere.

Choosing:
- E at position 3,
- N at position 2,
- A at position 4,

gives the pattern **_ N E A _**. A common English word that fits this pattern is **SNEAK** (S N E A K). It respects all position constraints and introduces two new letters (S and K) that have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be “SNEAK”.
