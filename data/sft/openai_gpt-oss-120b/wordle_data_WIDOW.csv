### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N, Y. From the second guess, O is present but not in position 3. Therefore O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. We need a 5‑letter word containing O (in a different spot) and four other letters that are not any of the excluded ones. ""OPIUM"" fits: O is at position 1, and the letters P, I, U, M have never been ruled out. It’s a valid English word, so it’s a good next guess.

We know the secret word does NOT contain the letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N, Y, P, U, M.  
From previous feedback:
- O is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.
- I is also in the word but not in position 3.

Thus O must be in position 2, 4, or 5, and I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both O and I, respects those position constraints, and uses only letters that have not been ruled out.  

The word **WIDOW** satisfies all conditions:
- Contains O (position 4) – not 1 or 3.
- Contains I (position 2) – not 3.
- Remaining letters W, D are not among the excluded set.
- It is a valid English word.

So the next guess is “WIDOW”.
