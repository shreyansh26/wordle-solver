### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:

- From guess 2 (SLEPT): S, L are not in the word. E is correct in position 3. P is in the word but not in position 4. T is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus:
- Position 3 = **E**.
- The word contains **P** (possible positions 1, 2, 5) and **T** (possible positions 1, 2, 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, L.

We need a new word that respects these constraints, includes P and T, and avoids the excluded letters.  
A valid candidate is **POETY**:
- P at position 1 (allowed for P),
