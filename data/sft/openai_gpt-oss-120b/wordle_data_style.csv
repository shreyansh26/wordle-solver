### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a word of form S _ _ _ E with L in position 3 or 4, not 2. A good candidate is **SMILE** (S M I L E): L is in position 4, satisfying the constraint, and it introduces new letters M and I to test.

We have determined the known letters:
- Position 1: S (✓ from SLOPE and SMILE)
- Position 4: L (✓ from SMILE, confirming the earlier “‑” on position 2 in SLOPE)
- Position 5: E (✓ from CRANE, SLOPE, SMILE)

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S _ _ L E**.

Letters that have been ruled out (appear as “x”): C, R, A, N, O, P, M, I.  
Letters still possible for positions 2 and 3 are any not in that excluded set.

A common English word matching **S??LE** with unused letters is **STYLE** (S T Y L E).  
T and Y have not been tried yet and are not among the excluded letters, making “STYLE” a logical next guess.

Therefore I will guess:
