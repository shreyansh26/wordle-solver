### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern is ? L I E R based on feedback:
- Positions 2-5 are L, I, E, R respectively (all confirmed).
- Position 1 is still unknown, but cannot be any letters that have been ruled out: C, A, N, O, V, S, P, R (already used at end), etc.
We need a common 5‑letter English word matching _LIER. Viable candidates include:
- FLIER (American spelling of “flyer”)
- GLIER (comparative of “gli”, not common)
- BLier? (not a word)
Thus “FLIER” is the most plausible common word and introduces a new, untested letter F.
