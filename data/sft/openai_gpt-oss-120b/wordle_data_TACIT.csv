### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and varied positions. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in these word games because it checks the vowels A and E and common consonants C, R, and N. This will give useful information for the next steps.

We have:
- From CRANE: C is in the word but not in position 1; A is in the word but not in position 3; R, N, E are not in the word.
- From BASIC: A is correct at position 2; I is correct at position 4; C is in the word but not at position 5; B, S are not in the word.

Thus the secret word layout is:
1 ? (cannot be C, R, N, E, B, S)
2 A
3 ? (C cannot be 1 or 5, so C must be here)
4 I
5 ? (cannot be C, R, N, E, B, S)

So the pattern is **_ A C I _**. A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not yet eliminated is **TACIT** (T A C I T).

This satisfies all known constraints, so I’ll guess “TACIT”.
