### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R and A, places them in positions other than 2 and 3 respectively, and avoids C, N, E. The word **RADAR** satisfies these constraints: it contains R and A, puts R in positions 1 and 5 (neither is position 2), puts A in positions 2 and 4 (neither is position 3), and introduces a new letter D while avoiding the excluded letters.

- The final letter cannot be W, nor any of the previously excluded letters (C, N, E, D). Possible common completions are “P” (STRAP) or “Y” (STRAY).
