### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, the secret word must contain A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. We should choose a new word that includes A and avoids the known absent letters. A good candidate is **SHALT** (S, H, A, L, T): it contains A and introduces new letters S, H, L, T for testing, while not using C, R, N, or E.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, N, E, S, H, T are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and L, with A not at the 3rd spot and L not at the 4th spot. We need a word that includes both A and L, avoids all excluded letters, and introduces new letters to learn more about the remaining positions.

The word **ALBUM** fits:
- A at position 1 (allowed).
- L at position 2 (allowed).
- Adds new letters B, U, M which haven’t been tested yet.
- Contains no excluded letters.

Thus ALBUM is a good next guess.
