### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- The letter E is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.
- The letter L is in the word but not at position 5 (it was guessed at position 5 and got a “-”), so L must be in one of positions 1‑3.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E _. L must be in positions 1‑3.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **SLEEK** (S L E E K):

- E is at position 4 (correct).
- No disallowed letters are present.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Letters excluded: C, R, A, N, V, O, W, S, K, D.
- Confirmed letters and positions:
  * B at position 1 (✓ from BLEED)
  * L at position 2 (✓ from SLEEK and BLEED)
  * E at position 3 (✓ from SLEEK and BLEED)
  * E at position 4 (✓ from SLEEK and BLEED)

Thus the word is B L E E _. The fifth letter cannot be D (was marked x) and must not be any excluded letters. Viable common English words fitting ""BLEE_"": ""BLEEP"" (P is not excluded) and ""BLEES"" (S excluded). ""BLEEP"" is a known word and fits all constraints. So we will guess ""BLEEP"".
