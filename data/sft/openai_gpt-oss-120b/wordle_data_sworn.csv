### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, E are not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

Thus the secret word must contain R and N, with R ≠ position 2 and N ≠ position 4. All other letters are still unknown, but we should avoid C, A, E in our next guess.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **RINDS**:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3), meeting the “‑” positions.
- Uses new letters I, D, S to gather more information.
- No forbidden letters (C, A, E) are present.

We have the following information from feedback:

  * N cannot be positions 3 or 4 → N can be 1, 2, or 5.
  * S cannot be position 5 → S can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
