### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, W, D.
- Letters in the word but misplaced: R (not position 2 or 4), S (not position 1), O (not position 3).

We need a 5‑letter word containing R, S, O plus two other allowed letters, respecting those position restrictions.

The word “TORUS” uses T, O, R, U, S.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, not position 3).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not positions 2 or 4).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, not position 1).
All letters are allowed (none are excluded).

Thus “TORUS” satisfies all constraints and is a valid guess.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word (x): C, A, N, E, W, D, T, U.
- Letters present but misplaced (-):
  * R is present, cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → R can be 1 or 5.
  * S is present, cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → S can be 2, 3, or 4.
  * O is present, cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → O can be 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter English word using R, S, O plus two other allowed letters (not in the excluded set) that respects those position limits.

The word **VISOR** fits:
- V I S O R
- Position 1: V (allowed)
- Position 2: I (allowed)
- Position 3: S (S is allowed at 3)
- Position 4: O (O is allowed at 4)
- Position 5: R (R is allowed at 5)

All letters are from the allowed pool and the placement respects the constraints. Thus VISOR is a valid next guess.
