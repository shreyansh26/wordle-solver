### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Starts with C.
2. Contains R and A in positions different from their previous spots (R ≠ 2, A ≠ 3).
3. Omits N and E.

A good candidate is **CARGO**:
- C at position 1 (matches).
- A moves to position 2 (allowed, since A wasn’t in position 3 before).
- R moves to position 3 (allowed, since R wasn’t in position 2 before).
- G and O are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Thus “CARGO” satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh letters to test.
