### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback so far:

- **CRANE** → all letters are not in the word.
- **SIGHT** → all letters are not in the word.
- **JUMBO** → J, U, M, B are not in the word; **O** is in the word but not in position 5.
- **FLOOD** → F and D are not in the word; **L** is in the word but not in position 2; **O** is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.

Thus:
- The secret word must contain **O** and **L**.
- O cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 → O must be in position 1 or 2.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- All other letters we have tried (C,R,A,N,E,S,I,G,H,T,J,U,M,B,F,D) are excluded.

The remaining unused letters are: **K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z** (and any other letters not yet tried).  

We need a valid English 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains O (in position 1 or 2) and L (not in position 2).
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

The word **“POLLY”** fits:
- P O L L Y → O is in position 2 (allowed), L appears in positions 3 and 4 (not position 2), and no excluded letters are used.

Therefore “POLLY” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the following feedback:

- **CRANE**: all letters marked x → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **SIGHT**: all letters marked x → S, I, G, H, T are not in the word.
- **JUMBO**: J, U, M, B are x; O is “-” → O is in the word but not in position 5.
- **FLOOD**: F and D are x; L is “-” → L is in the word but not in position 2; O is “-” again → O not in positions 3 or 4.
- **POLLY**: P (✓), O (✓), L (✓), L (-), Y (-).

From POLLY we know:
- Positions 1‑3 are correct: **P O L**.
- The second L (position 4) got “-”, meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have an L at position 3, the word could have a second L elsewhere (position 5), or only one L.
- Y got “-” at position 5, so Y is in the word but not at position 5. The only remaining open slot is position 4, so Y must be at position 4.

Thus the pattern is **P O L Y _**.

All letters that have been ruled out (x) are: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, G, H, T, J, U, M, B, F, D.  
Remaining possible letters are: **K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z** (and any repeats of already‑found letters).

A common English word that fits the pattern **P O L Y _** and uses only allowed letters is **POLYP** (a biological term). It places a second **P** in the final position, which has not been excluded.
