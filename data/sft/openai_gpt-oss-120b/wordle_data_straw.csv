### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess (CRANE) we know:
- C, N, E are NOT in the word.
- R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

From the second guess (RAILS) we learned:
- I and L are NOT in the word.
- R is still not in position 1 (so R cannot be 1 or 2).
- A is still not in position 2 (so A cannot be 2 or 3).
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **R, A, S** plus two other letters that are not among {C, N, E, I, L}.  
Position restrictions:
- R cannot be 1 or 2.
- A cannot be 2 or 3.
- S cannot be 5.

A common word that satisfies all these constraints is **STRAY**:
- S at position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- T at position 2 (new letter)
- R at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2)
- A at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- Y at position 5 (new letter, S is not here)

All letters are permissible, so “STRAY” is a valid next guess.

- A is still not in position 2 (so A cannot be 2 or 3).
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **R, A, S** plus two other letters that are not among {C, N, E, I, L}.  
Position restrictions:
- R cannot be 1 or 2.
- A cannot be 2 or 3.
- S cannot be 5.

A common word that satisfies all these constraints is **STRAY**:
- S at position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- T at position 2 (new letter)
- R at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2)
- A at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- Y at position 5 (new letter, S is not here)

All letters are permissible, so “STRAY” is a valid next guess.
