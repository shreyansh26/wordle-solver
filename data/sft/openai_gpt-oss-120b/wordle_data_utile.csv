### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Guess 3: EXILE → I correct at 3, L correct at 4, E correct at 5, the E at position 1 is wrong (so the only E is at position 5), and X is not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ I L E, with letters C,R,A,N,S,D,X excluded, and only one E at the end.

A common English word matching this pattern and using letters not yet ruled out is **WHILE** (W‑H‑I‑L‑E).

We have established the pattern _ _ I L E with fixed letters I (3rd), L (4th), E (5th). Excluded letters are C, R, A, N, S, D, X, W, H, and also E cannot be elsewhere. Potential letters for positions 1 and 2 must avoid these. A valid English word fitting the pattern is **UTILE** (U‑T‑I‑L‑E), using letters not yet ruled out. This will test U and T in the first two spots.
