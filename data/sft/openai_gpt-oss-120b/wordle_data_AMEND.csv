### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the first guess SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the secret word.
- A and E are in the secret word, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that excludes S, L, T, includes A and E in different positions, and uses other letters that might still be possible.  
Choosing **RAZED** gives:
- A at position 2 (allowed, not position 3).
- E at position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- No forbidden letters S, L, T.
Thus it satisfies all current constraints and will give new information about the remaining letters.

From the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, R, T, Z.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- D is correct at position 5.

So the secret word must end with D, contain A (in position 1 or 4) and E (in position 1, 2, or 3).  
A word that satisfies all these constraints and avoids the excluded letters is **AMEND** (A‑M‑E‑N‑D).  
A is at position 1 (allowed), E at position 3 (allowed), D at position 5 (confirmed), and the other letters M and N are still possible.
