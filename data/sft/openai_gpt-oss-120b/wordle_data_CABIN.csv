### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R and E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word starts with **C**, contains **A** (not third) and **N** (not fourth), and excludes R and E.  
A good next guess should keep C in the first spot, keep A and N somewhere else, and introduce new letters to gather more information.  
I’ll guess **CANDY** (C‑A‑N‑D‑Y), which respects the known constraints and adds D and Y for testing.

We have determined:
- Position 1 = C (confirmed)
- Position 2 = A (confirmed)
- Position 5 = N (since N cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and those first two are taken)
- Letters R, E, D, Y are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is C A _ _ N. We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out. Choosing a word that introduces new letters helps confirm them. ""CABIN"" fits the pattern (C A B I N) and adds B and I, which are still possible.
