### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that only the last letter E is correct and all other letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all. So the secret word ends with E and contains none of those four letters.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- Position 5 is E (✓ from all guesses).
- From guess 4 (FENCE): Position 2 is E (✓) and Position 3 is N (✓). So the pattern is _ E N _ E.
- Letters excluded (marked x) are: S, L, A, T, B, R, I, U, D, G, F, C.
- The only remaining letters that could occupy positions 1 and 4 are from the set {H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
- A common English word fitting the pattern _ E N _ E with allowed letters is **PENNE** (P‑E‑N‑N‑E). It uses P (still possible), repeats N (already known), and ends with E.
Thus the next logical guess is PENNE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E, containing N in position 1‑3, and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
“NUDGE” fits:

We have the pattern based on feedback:

- Position 3 = N (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)

Excluded letters (marked x): S, L, A, T, B, R, I, D, G, F, C, P.
Letters that are in the word but not yet placed (marked –): 
- N (already placed at position 3, so N only appears there)
- U (from NUDGE) – it is in the word but not at position 2. Thus U must be at position 1 or 4.

Therefore the secret word fits the pattern **_ E N _ E** with a U in either the first or fourth slot.

If U is in position 4, the word becomes **? E N U E**. The common English word **VENUE** matches this pattern:
- V E N U E
- Uses U at position 4,
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (V is still possible).

Thus ""VENUE"" satisfies all known constraints and is a logical next guess.
