### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- Guess 2 (NIGHT): N is still in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are not in the word.
- Guess 3 (SNOWY): O is correct at position 3, W is correct at position 4, S and Y are not in the word, and N is still in the word but not at position 2.

Thus:
- Letters confirmed: O (pos 3), W (pos 4), N (somewhere, but cannot be 1,2,4; only possible spot left is position 5).
- The pattern must be **_ _ O W N**.
- Positions 1 and 2 must be letters not yet ruled out. The only common English word that fits this pattern while respecting all exclusions is **BLOWN** (B at 1, L at 2, O‑W‑N fixed).

So the next guess is:

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- From guess 4 (BLOWN): L, O, W, N are correct at positions 2‑5.
- The first letter cannot be B (marked x) and cannot be any letters previously ruled out: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, S, T, Y.
- Remaining possible first letters are D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.
- The common English word that fits ""?LOWN"" with an allowed first letter is **FLOWN** (F is not excluded).

Thus the next logical guess is ""FLOWN"".
