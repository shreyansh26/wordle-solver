### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that covers common letters and vowel placements. “CRANE” includes two common vowels (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This should give good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- CRAZY (C R A Z Y)
- CRANK is invalid because N is excluded.

We have established that the first three letters are C, R, A in the correct positions. The fourth letter C got a “-” indicating C is in the word but not in that position, so the secret word contains another C elsewhere. Since position 1 already has a C, the second C must be at position 5. Therefore the pattern is C R A _ C.

We need a valid English word matching C R A _ C with the remaining unknown fourth letter not being any excluded letters (N, E, S, H, K). The word “CRAIC” (an Irish term meaning fun) fits perfectly: C‑R‑A‑I‑C. I has not been ruled out, so this is a good next guess.

We have confirmed the first three letters are C, R, A (all green). 
Letters excluded (x): N, E, S, H, K, I.
The extra C guesses got a yellow, which in this game just indicates C exists elsewhere (the C at position 1). So the word likely contains only one C at the start.

We need a valid 5‑letter word starting with “CRA” whose fourth and fifth letters are not any of the excluded letters. Possible options include **CRAMP**, **CRAZY**, **CRAVY** (non‑standard), etc. “CRAZY” uses Z and Y, both not ruled out, and forms a common English word.

Thus the next logical guess is “CRAZY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
