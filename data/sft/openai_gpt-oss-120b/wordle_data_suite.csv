### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “CRANE” tells us that the only correct letter is E, and it is in the correct fifth position. All other letters (C, R, A, N) are not in the word at all. So the secret word has the form _ _ _ _ E and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. I’ll choose a new common five‑letter word that ends with E and avoids those letters. “GLOBE” fits these constraints.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: T (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

All other letters that received an ""x"" are not in the word: C, R, A, N, G, L, O, B, M, P.

Thus the unknown is position 2. It must be a letter not among the excluded set. The only common English word matching the pattern S_ITE with a permissible second letter is **SUITE** (U is not excluded). This fits all constraints, so we will guess it.
