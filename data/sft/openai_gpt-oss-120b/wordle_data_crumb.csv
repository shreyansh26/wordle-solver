### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word begins with C and R in the correct first two positions, and it does not contain A, N, or E anywhere. The remaining three letters are unknown but must be different from A, N, E. A good strategy is to try a common word that keeps the confirmed “CR” prefix and introduces three new letters to test. “CRISP” fits: it keeps “CR” and adds I, S, P, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We know from the first two guesses that the secret word starts with “C R”. All other letters tried (A, N, E, I, S, P) are not in the word. We need a word of the form C R _ _ _.
