### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and consonants. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving the game useful information about letters and positions for the secret word.

We know:
- The first letter is C (✓).
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5. So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

We need a new guess that keeps C in the first slot, puts E in one of the allowed positions, and introduces new letters to test. Choose a word with C first and E in position 3, such as **CLEFT** (C‑L‑E‑F‑T). This respects all constraints and adds L, F, T for further information.

We have:
- Position 1 is C (confirmed).
- Letters R, A, N, F, T are not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (it was wrong at pos5 in guess 1 and wrong at pos3 in guess 2), so E can be in position 2 or 4.
- We still need two more letters.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **CELLO**:
- C at position 1 (fixed).
- E at position 2 (allowed for E).
- L at position 3 (L not allowed at 2, so 3 is fine).
- L at position 4 (still allowed).
- O at position 5 (O hasn't been ruled out).

Thus CELLO is a valid next guess.
