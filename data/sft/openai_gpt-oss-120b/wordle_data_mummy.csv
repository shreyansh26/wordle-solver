### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters from the first two guesses:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From SLOTH: S, L, O, T, H are not in the secret word.

Thus the remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a new 5‑letter word that uses only these letters and preferably introduces several new ones to gather more information. “JUMPY” uses J, U, M, P, Y, all of which are still possible, and it’s a valid English word. This guess will test five new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = U (confirmed)
- Position 3 = M (confirmed)
- Position 4 = M (confirmed)
- Position 5 = Y (confirmed)

Thus the word looks like _ U M M Y.

All letters that have been marked incorrect (x) are: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H, J, P, D, G, B? Actually B hasn't been tried yet, but listed eliminated letters are C,R,A,N,E,S,L,O,T,H,J,P,D,G. Also from earlier guesses, letters U, M, Y are correct.

The only plausible English word matching _ U M M Y using only allowed letters is **MUMMY** (M U M M Y). This places an additional M at position 1, which hasn't been ruled out.
