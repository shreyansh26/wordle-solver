### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these word games because it tests both a frequent vowel (A, E) and several common consonants (C, R, N). I’ll use that as my first guess.

The feedback tells me that C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word, and E is in the word but not in position 5. I should choose a new guess that avoids the excluded letters and places E in a different spot to test its exact position. “PESTO” fits: it contains E at position 2, and all other letters (P, S, T, O) are still possible.

We have two rounds of feedback.

1. From **CRANE**: C, R, A, N are not in the word (x). E is in the word but not in position 5 (‑).

2. From **PESTO**: P, T, O are not in the word (x). E is still in the word but not in position 2 (‑). S is also in the word but not in position 3 (‑).

So far:
- Confirmed letters: **E**, **S**
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, P, T, O
- Possible positions:
  * **E** can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5)
  * **S** can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3)

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes **E** and **S** in positions consistent with the clues, and uses only letters not yet excluded. A good candidate is **SHELL**:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses only new letters H and L, which have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess will be “SHELL”.

- Position 2: L (must be L because L is present but not at positions 4 or 5)
- Position 3: E (correct)
- Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown.

All letters that have been shown NOT to be in the word: C, R, A, N, P, T, O, H, plus any other letters seen as “x”. The remaining viable letters can be placed in positions 4 and 5.

A common English word fitting the pattern S L E _ _ is **SLEEK** (S‑L‑E‑E‑K). It uses only letters not yet excluded (E repeats, which is allowed, and K is still possible). This will test whether the fourth letter is another E and whether K is the final letter.
