### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From guess 2 (STOUT): S, T, O, U are not in the word.
- From guess 3 (BLIMP): B and P are not in the word; L, I, and M are in the word but in wrong positions.

Thus the secret word must contain L, I, M each in a different position than they occupied in “BLIMP” (L cannot be 2nd, I cannot be 3rd, M cannot be 4th). All other letters used so far (C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,U,B,P) are excluded.

We need two additional letters that have not been ruled out: possible choices are D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate that satisfies the positional constraints is **MILKY**:
- M is in position 1 (allowed, not position 4),
- I is in position 2 (allowed, not position 3),
- L is in position 3 (allowed, not position 2),
- K and Y are new letters not yet tested.

Thus MILKY is a valid next guess.
