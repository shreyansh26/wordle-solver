### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E. It does contain R, but R is not in position 2 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore our next guess must:
- Exclude letters C, A, N, E.
- Include the letter R, placed somewhere other than the second slot.
Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints will give us the most information. “SHRUB” meets all conditions: it contains R in the third position, and none of its other letters are C, A, N, or E.

We have determined from the feedback that the secret word:

- Starts with **R** (R is ✓ in position 1).
- Does NOT contain the letters C, A, N, E, S, H, U, B, I, F, T, Y.
- May contain any of the remaining letters: D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and possibly another R.

To get more information we need a valid 5‑letter word that begins with R and uses letters from the remaining pool.  
“RIGOR” satisfies this: it keeps R in the first position, includes two new letters **G** and **O** (both still unknown), repeats R at the end (testing if R appears elsewhere), and only adds **I**, which we already know is not in the word, but that is acceptable for probing G and O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Choosing **RIFTY** satisfies those constraints:

We have confirmed that the secret word starts with **R** (R is green in position 1). All letters marked x are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, H, U, B, I, F, T, Y, G, O. Remaining possible letters are D, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
