I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common and less common letters, so the feedback will give me useful information about both presence and position of letters. “CRANE” is a good starter: it contains a frequent consonant (C, R, N), a vowel (A, E) and a mix of positions.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has R in the second position and N in the fourth position. Letters C, A, and E are not present anywhere. The pattern is _ R _ N _. I need a valid word that fits this pattern and uses letters that have not been ruled out. ""GRIND"" matches: G R I N D, places R and N correctly and introduces new letters G, I, D to test.
