### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, and E are NOT in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word, but A is NOT in position 3 and N is NOT in position 4.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
- Contains A and N in different positions (avoiding the forbidden positions).
- Does NOT contain C, R, or E.
- Introduces new letters to learn more about the word.

The word **SALON** fits these requirements:
- Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), respecting the position constraints.
- Uses none of the excluded letters C, R, E.
- Adds the new letters S, L, O for further testing.

Thus, the next guess will be SALON.

We have:

- N is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5, so N can be at positions 1‑3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, L.

We need a 5‑letter word with O at 4, containing A and N in allowed spots, and no excluded letters.  
A plausible word is **ANNOY**:
- A at position 1 (allowed),
- N at positions 2 and 3 (allowed),
- O at position 4 (confirmed),
- Y at position 5 (new letter to test).

This satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter (Y) for further information.
