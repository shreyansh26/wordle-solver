### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common, information‑rich 5‑letter word. “CRANE” contains a mix of common vowels and consonants and is frequently used as an opening guess, so it should give useful feedback for the next steps.

All letters from the first guess CRANE are confirmed absent, so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E. I need a new 5‑letter word using only the remaining letters. Choosing a common word with varied letters will give the most useful information. “MOUTH” uses M, O, U, T, H – all allowed – and covers both vowels and consonants.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, U, T, H are not in the word.
- Letter O is correct and in the second position.

Thus the secret word has pattern _ O _ _ _. All remaining letters must come from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones. Good candidate words with O in the second slot and using only allowed letters include “SOLID” (S O L I D) and “BOLDS” (B O L D S). Choosing “SOLID” tests four new letters (S, L, I, D) and keeps O fixed, giving us maximal new information.
