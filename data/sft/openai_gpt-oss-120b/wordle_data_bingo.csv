### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the known letters:
- Position 1: B (✓)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)

Letters D and S are not in the word. Previously excluded letters are C, R, A, E, G, H, T, plus D, S.

We need a common 5‑letter word that starts with “BIN” and uses only letters that have not been ruled out for positions 4 and 5. Candidates include “BINKY” (B I N K Y), where K and Y are still possible. This fits the pattern and follows all constraints.

Hence the next guess will be BINKY.

We have confirmed the first three letters are B (pos1), I (pos2), N (pos3).  
From the second guess NIGHT, G received a “-”, meaning G is in the word but not in position 3.  
Thus G must occupy one of the remaining spots (pos4 or pos5).  

All other letters marked “x” are excluded: C, R, A, E, H, T, D, S, K, Y.  
Letters not yet ruled out include G, O, L, M, P, U, etc.

The common word that fits the pattern B I N _ _ with G somewhere after the third letter is **BINGO** (G at position 4, O at position 5). This satisfies all previous clues.

So the next guess should be BINGO.
