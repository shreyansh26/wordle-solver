### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both R and A, avoids C, N, E, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and A somewhere other than the third slot.

The word **RAZOR** satisfies all these constraints:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) – not position 2.
- Contains A (position 2) – not position 3.
- Uses only new letters Z and O besides the known ones.
- No prohibited letters C, N, or E.

Thus “RAZOR” is a good second guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, N, E are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. A is in the word but not in position 3.
- From RAZOR: Z is not in the word. O is in the word but not in position 4. Both R’s are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5. Both A’s are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Thus the secret word must contain **R, A, O** and exclude **C, N, E, Z**.  
Positions allowed:
- R cannot be 1, 2, or 5 → possible positions 3 or 4.  
- A cannot be 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, or 5.  
- O cannot be 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **FORAY**:
- F (new letter, allowed)
- O in position 2 (O is present, not position 4)
- R in position 3 (R is present, not positions 1, 2, 5)
- A in position 4 (A is present, not positions 2, 3)
- Y in position 5 (new allowed letter)

All letters are allowed and all positional constraints are met, making FORAY a valid next guess.
