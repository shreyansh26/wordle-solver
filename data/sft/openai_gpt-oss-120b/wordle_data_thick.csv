### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess of a common 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is one that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels to gather information quickly. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter word because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E. This should give useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word must contain a C somewhere other than the first slot, and must avoid R, A, N, E.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C and I (respecting those position restrictions) and three other letters that haven’t been ruled out.

- I is in position 1 (allowed) and also position 3 (allowed).
