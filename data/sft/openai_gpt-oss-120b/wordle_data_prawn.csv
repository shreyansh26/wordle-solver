### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the following feedback so far:
- Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(-), E(x)  
  → R is correct at position 2, A is correct at position 3, N is in the word but not at position 4, C and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: BRAIN → B(x), R(✓), A(✓), I(x), N(✓)  
  → Confirms R at position 2 and A at position 3, N is correct at position 5, and B, I are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is **_ R A _ N** with the constraints:
- Position 2 = R, position 3 = A, position 5 = N.
- Letters C, B, I, E are excluded.
- N is not at position 4 (already satisfied by N being at 5).

We need a common 5‑letter word matching **_ R A _ N**.  
Possible candidates include “DRANK”, “GRAND”, “FRANK”, etc., but those place N in position 4, which is disallowed.  

The word **DRAWN** fits perfectly:
- D R A W N → matches the pattern, uses allowed letters, and respects all constraints.

So the next guess should be “DRAWN”.
