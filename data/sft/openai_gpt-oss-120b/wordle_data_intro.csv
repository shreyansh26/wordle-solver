### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain C, A, or E. It does contain R and N, but R cannot be in the 2nd position and N cannot be in the 4th position (their positions in “CRANE”). We need a new five‑letter word that includes R and N in other positions and avoids the forbidden letters. “THORN” satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R (4th position, not 2nd) and N (5th position, not 4th).
- Uses only letters T, H, O, R, N, none of which were ruled out.
Thus it is a good next guess.
