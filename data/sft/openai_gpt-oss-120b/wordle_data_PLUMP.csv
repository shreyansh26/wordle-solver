### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, I, D, Y are not in the secret word.
- Letter L is correct and in the exact second position.

Thus the secret word has the form _ L _ _ _. All remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

A valid common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **PLUMB** (P‑L‑U‑M‑B). None of its letters are among the eliminated set, and L is already correctly placed.

So the next guess will be PLUMB.
