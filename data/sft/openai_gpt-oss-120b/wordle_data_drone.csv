### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that only the last letter 'E' is correct and in the right spot; all other letters (S, L, A, T) are not in the word at all.

We know:
- Position 3 is O (✓ from CHORE).
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (marked “-” in CHORE).

A good candidate that respects these constraints is **PROBE** (P‑R‑O‑B‑E). It places R at position 2 (allowed), keeps O at position 3 and E at position 5, and introduces new letters P and B for further testing.
