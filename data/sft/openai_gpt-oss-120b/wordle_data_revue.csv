### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 1 = R (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)
- The letter U is in the word but not in position 2 (from RUBIE, feedback U(-)). So U must be in position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters: A, B, C, F, G, H, I, M, N, O, Y.
- Remaining possible letters for the middle spots: D, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z, plus U.

A word that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **REVUE**:
- Starts with R and ends with E.
- Places U at position 4 (allowed, since U isn’t in position 2).
- Uses V, which hasn’t been tested yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus this guess will confirm the correct placement of U and test a new letter.
