### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 is I (from multiple ✓ marks).
- Position 4 is T (✓ in guess 4).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ in guess 4).
- Position 3 cannot be T (the T at position 3 in guess 4 got a “-”).
- Position 1 cannot be any of the letters that have received an “x”: C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, P, S, D.
- All other letters (B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) remain possible.

We need a word of the form _ I _ T Y that does not use any excluded letters and has a non‑T letter in the third spot.

“FIFTY” fits perfectly:
- F is not excluded.
- I is already confirmed at position 2.
- The third letter is also F (allowed and not T).
- T is at position 4 (matches the confirmed T).
- Y is at position 5 (matches the confirmed Y).

Thus the next logical guess is **FIFTY**.
