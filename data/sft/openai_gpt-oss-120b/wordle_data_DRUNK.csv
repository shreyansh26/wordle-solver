### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the word-guessing game with any valid 5‑letter English word. A good first guess uses common letters and spreads them out to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a frequent starter in these games because it contains common consonants and vowels without repeats.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word looks like _ R _ N _. I need a new 5‑letter word with R at the second spot and N at the fourth spot, using other letters that haven’t been ruled out. “TRUNK” fits this pattern and contains none of the excluded letters.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = R (confirmed)
- Position 3 = U (confirmed)
- Position 4 = N (confirmed)
- Position 5 = K (confirmed)
- Position 1 is still unknown; letters known not in the word are C, A, E, T.
We need a common 5‑letter English word of the form _RUNK. The obvious candidate is **DRUNK**, which uses D (not excluded) in the first position and matches the known pattern.
