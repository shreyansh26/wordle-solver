### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A is confirmed at position 2.
- E is confirmed at position 4.
- T is present but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from FACET), and also not in position 3 (from MATER). Therefore T must be in position 1.
Thus the word looks like **T A _ E _**.

Letters known not to be in the word: S, L, M, R, F, C (all marked x).  
We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet excluded.  
Possible valid English words matching the pattern include **TAKEN**, **TAPED**, **TAXED**, etc.
