### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A is in the word at position 4 (A ✓).
- L is in the word but not at position 2 (L -).
- O is in the word but not at position 3 (O -).

Thus we need a 5‑letter word with:
- A at the 4th spot.
- L somewhere except position 2.
- O somewhere except position 3.
- No C, R, N, E, G, T.

The word **LOYAL** fits perfectly:
- L (1) – allowed (L not at position 2).
- O (2) – allowed (O not at position 3).
- Y (3) – a neutral letter.
- A (4) – matches the confirmed A.
- L (5) – allowed.

All letters satisfy the constraints, so LOYAL is an optimal next guess.

- L (5) – allowed.

All letters satisfy the constraints, so LOYAL is an optimal next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- A is correct at position 4.
- L is correct at position 5, and also appears elsewhere (so it’s in the word but not at position 1).
- O is in the word but not at position 2 or 3, so O must be at position 1.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, G, T, Y, and also G, L (but L is allowed because we already have it at position 5).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form O _ _ A L that contains an L (already at position 5) and satisfies all constraints.  
“OXIAL” fits perfectly:
- O (1) – allowed (O is at the first position)
- X (2) – a neutral letter not excluded
- I (3) – a neutral letter not excluded
- A (4) – confirmed
- L (5) – confirmed

Thus “OXIAL” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Position 1 = O (confirmed).
- Position 4 = A (confirmed).
- Position 5 = L (confirmed).
- Letters C, R, N, E, G, T, Y, X, I are not in the word.
- L is present but not in positions 1 or 2 (already satisfied by L at position 5).
- O is not in positions 2 or 3 (already satisfied by O at position 1).

Thus the word pattern is **O _ _ A L** with the remaining letters chosen from those not yet excluded.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **OFFAL** (O F F A L), which respects all constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be:
