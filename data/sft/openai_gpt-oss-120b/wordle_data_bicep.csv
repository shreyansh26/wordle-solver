### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From guess 1 (CRANE): C is in the word but not position 1, E is in the word but not position 5, and R, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore:
- C must be at position 3.
- E must be somewhere other than positions 2, 5, and also not position 1 (since CRANE gave C(-) at pos 1, but that does not restrict E). Actually CRANE gave E(-) meaning E is in the word but not position 5; the second guess tells us E is not position 2. So possible positions for E are 1 or 4.
