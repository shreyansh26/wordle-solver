### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening word uses common letters and positions. “SLATE” contains several frequent letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid English word, making it a solid first guess.

We have determined that the secret word must contain the letters L and E, and cannot contain S, A, T, M, O, N.  
From the feedback:
- L is NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- E is NOT in positions 2 or 5.

Thus L can be in positions 1, 4, or 5; E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

A word fitting these constraints and using only allowed letters is **LIVER**:
- L is at position 1 (acceptable).
- E is at position 4 (acceptable).
- The other letters I, V, R have not been ruled out yet.
