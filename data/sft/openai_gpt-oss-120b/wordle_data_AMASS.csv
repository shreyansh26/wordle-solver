### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I'll start with a common opening word that includes a mix of common letters and both vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess in these games because it tests for the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering a variety of possibilities.

We know from feedback that the secret word has A correct in the third position, and letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all. So the pattern is __A__. We need a new 5‑letter word with A as the third letter and none of the excluded letters. A good candidate is **PLASH** (P L A S H), which fits the pattern and uses only new letters.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): only A is correct and it is in the 3rd position. Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- From guess 2 (PLASH): A (3rd) and S (4th) are both correct and in the right spots. Letters P, L, H are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is __A S _. The letters we know are not allowed: C, R, N, E, P, L, H. We need a valid 5‑letter word with A in position 3 and S in position 4, using only remaining letters.

A good candidate is **AMASS** (A‑M‑A‑S‑S). It matches the pattern, repeats allowed letters, and contains no forbidden letters.

So the next guess will be AMASS.
