### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = L (correct)
- Position 3 = O (correct)
- Position 5 = S (correct)

Thus the word is _ L O _ S.  
Eliminated letters so far: A, B, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, P, R, T, W, and also from prior guesses C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,B,W,P. Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are D, F, J, K, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly repeat L or O).

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **FLOSS** (F L O S S). It places F at position 1 (still possible) and repeats S at position 4, which hasn't been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be “FLOSS”.
