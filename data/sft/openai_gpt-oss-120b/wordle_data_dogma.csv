### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich word to get information about both consonants and vowels. “CRANE” contains two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and the two most common vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback for the secret word.

Feedback from first guess:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain A somewhere other than the third slot, and must avoid C, R, N, E entirely. I’ll choose a word that includes A in a new position and introduces several new letters to test. “ALBUM” places A at position 1 and brings in L, B, U, M, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We know from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, L, B, U.
- Letters in the word: A and M.
- A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- M is not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes A and M, avoids the excluded letters, and respects the position constraints.

- A at position 2 (allowed),
- M at positions 3 and 4 (neither is position 5),
