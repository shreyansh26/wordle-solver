### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving useful information about the secret word’s composition and letter positions.

From the first guess CRANE, feedback tells us:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

So the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, N, E.
- Include A somewhere other than the 3rd slot.
- Use other common letters to gain more information.

A good candidate is “SALTY”: it contains A (in the 2nd position, which is allowed) and introduces new letters S, L, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out yet.
