### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback so far:
- Guess 1 (ARISE): A, I, S are not in the word; R and E are present but not in those positions.
- Guess 2 (RULER): E is correct at position 4, R is correct at position 5; the first R (position 1) is present elsewhere, U and L are not in the word.
- Guess 3 (BORER): B is not in the word; O is correct at position 2; the R at position 3 is present elsewhere (still the R at position 5); E and the R at position 5 remain correct.

Thus we know the secret word pattern is:
1 ? 2 O 3 ? 4 E 5 R

Letters already ruled out: A, I, S, U, L, B.  
We need letters for positions 1 and 3 that are not among the excluded set.

A common English word fitting the pattern **? O ? E R** is **COVER** (C O V E R). Neither C nor V has been eliminated, so this is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Thus the word pattern is __RER.
