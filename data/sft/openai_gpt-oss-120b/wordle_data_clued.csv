### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a common, information‑rich starter word.  
A good first guess uses a mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize feedback.  
“CRANE” contains two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two of the most common vowels (A, E).

- Position 2 = L (confirmed)
- Position 4 = E (the only remaining spot for E)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, N, O, F, T, plus any letters marked x.
Thus the pattern is C L _ E _. We need a valid English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters for positions 3 and 5.

Possible candidates: ""CLUES"" (C L U E S) fits the pattern, uses new letters U and S which have not been ruled out. It respects all previous feedback.

Therefore the next guess should be ""clues"".

We have determined the secret word pattern from the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- U is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 4.
- S is not in the word (position 5 is wrong).

Thus the word is C L U E _. We need a valid English word that fits ""CLUE?"" with a fifth letter that is not S and hasn't been ruled out. ""CLUED"" (past tense of clue) fits perfectly and introduces the new letter D, which hasn't been excluded yet.
