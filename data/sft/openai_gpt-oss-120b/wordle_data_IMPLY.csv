### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a frequent opening guess in these games because it tests two consonants (C, R, N) and both primary vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

All five letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent. I need a new word that doesn’t reuse any of those letters. Choosing a common word with fresh letters will give the most information. The word “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T, none of which have been eliminated yet, so it’s a good next guess.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From MIGHT: M(-) and I(-) indicate both letters are in the word but not in their guessed positions (M not at position 1, I not at position 2). G, H, T are not in the word.

Thus the secret word contains M and I, each somewhere else, and none of the excluded letters. We need a new guess that includes M and I in new positions and introduces fresh letters to gather more information.

The word **SMILY** fits:
- Contains M (position 2, different from position 1) and I (position 3, different from position 2).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (S, L, Y are new and allowed).
- Is a valid common 5‑letter English word.

So the next guess should be SMILY.
