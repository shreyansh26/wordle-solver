### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, giving good information about possible letters and positions. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter in word‑guessing games because it includes three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should provide useful feedback for the next steps.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed not to be in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely. Choosing a word with common letters that haven't been ruled out will give the most information. “GHOST” uses G, H, O, S, and T, none of which appeared in the first guess, so it’s a good next attempt.

We have eliminated letters from previous guesses:

- From GHOST: G, H, S, T are not in the word; O is present but not in position 3.
- From OPIUM: P, I, U, M are not in the word; O is also not in position 1.

Thus O is the only confirmed letter, and it cannot be in positions 1 or 3. Therefore O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

All other letters still possible are those we haven’t seen marked “x”: B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter English word that:
- Contains O (in position 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only the allowed letters for the remaining slots.

The word **JOLLY** fits:
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have eliminated letters from previous guesses:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From GHOST: G, H, S, T are not in the word; O is present but not in position 3.
- From OPIUM: P, I, U, M are not in the word; O is also not in position 1.

Thus O is the only confirmed letter, and it cannot be in positions 1 or 3. Therefore O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

All other letters still possible are those we haven’t seen marked “x”: B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter English word that:
- Contains O (in position 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only the allowed letters for the remaining slots.

The word **JOLLY** fits:
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Other letters J, L, L, Y are all from the still‑possible set.
- It is a valid English word.

So we guess JOLLY.

We have determined the secret word pattern from the fourth guess:
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: L (✓)
- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Thus the word is _ O L L Y.  
The first letter cannot be any of the letters already marked “x”: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, S, T, P, I, U, M, J. It also cannot be O, L, or Y because those are already placed. Viable candidates are “FOLLY” and “DOLLY”. Both use letters not yet eliminated. I’ll guess “FOLLY” to test the first position.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- Positions 2-5 are confirmed as O, L, L, Y respectively.
- Position 1 is still unknown, but must not be any letter that received an “x” feedback.
- Letters marked “x” so far: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, S, T, P, I, U, M, J, F.
- Therefore the only viable candidates for the first letter are B, D, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Among English words of the form ""?OLLY"", the common ones are **DOLLY** and **BOLLY** (the latter is uncommon). ""DOLLY"" uses D, which is still allowed. Hence the best next guess is **DOLLY**.
