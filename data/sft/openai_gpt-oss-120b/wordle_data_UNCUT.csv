### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes C and N in different positions, avoiding R, A, and E. “PUNCH” places N in position 3 and C in position 4, satisfying the positional constraints, and introduces new letters (P, U, H) to gather more information.

We have confirmed letters:
- C is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- N is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4.
- U is in the word, but not in position 2.

All other letters tried (R, A, E, P, H) are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C, N, and U that respects those position constraints and avoids the excluded letters.  
The word **UNCUT** fits:
- U is in positions 1 and 4 (both allowed, not position 2).
- N is in position 2 (allowed, not 3 or 4).
- C is in position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- Remaining letter T has not been ruled out.

Thus UNCUT is a valid next guess.
