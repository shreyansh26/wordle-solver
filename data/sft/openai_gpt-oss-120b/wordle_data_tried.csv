### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- From CRANE: R is correct at position 2, E is in the word but not at position 5.

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ R I E R** is **BRIER** (B R I E R). This satisfies all the known letters, and the extra R appears at the last position, which aligns with the “-” feedback for the final R in the second guess.

Letters ruled out: C, A, N, F, B (all marked x).  
Other letters (including D, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) are still possible.

We need a word of the form _ R I E _. A common English word fitting this pattern is **DRIER** (D R I E R). D has not been ruled out, and the final R may be yellow again, which is allowed under the current feedback rules.

Thus we guess **DRIER**.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 2 = R (green)
- Position 3 = I (green)
- Position 4 = E (green)

Feedback also tells us:
- D is in the word but not in position 1 → D must be in position 5.
- The last R in the guesses is marked “-”, meaning the word contains an R elsewhere (we already have the R at position 2), so the secret word likely has only one R.

Thus the pattern is **_ R I E D**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out is **TRIED**.

So the next guess is:
