### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants. This should give me a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first feedback:
- N is correct and in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must look like ???N? with an E somewhere in positions 1‑3 (or possibly 5, but we already know 5 is wrong). A good next guess should keep N in the 4th spot and include new letters while still containing E (but not at position 5). The word **STONE** satisfies these constraints: it has N in the 4th position, includes E (at the 5th position, which we know is incorrect), and introduces the letters S, T, and O for further testing while avoiding C, R, and A.

We have:
- N is correct at position 4.
- O is correct at position 3.
- E is in the word but not at position 5; possible positions 1 or 2.
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, S, T, (and from earlier feedback) also C,R,A,S,T are out.

We need a word pattern _ _ O N _. With E in position 1 or 2, and new letters to test position 5.

The word **EBONY** fits:
- Position 1 = E (tests E’s correct spot).
- Position 2 = B (new letter).
- Position 3 = O (matches known O).
- Position 4 = N (matches known N).
- Position 5 = Y (new letter to discover).

All letters are allowed, so EBONY is an optimal next guess.
