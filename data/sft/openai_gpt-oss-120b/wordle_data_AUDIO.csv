### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first guess CRANE, we know:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, R, N, E.

I need a common 5‑letter word that fits these constraints. “ADULT” works:
- Contains A in position 1 (allowed).
- Uses letters D, U, L, T, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus ADULT is a valid next guess.

We have:
- A is confirmed at position 1.
- D is in the word but not at position 2.
- U is in the word but not at position 3.
- Letters C, R, N, E, L, T are not present.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with A that also contains D and U in positions other than the ones they were guessed. The word “AUDIO” fits:
- Starts with A (correct).
- Contains U at position 2 (U is not allowed at 3, so position 2 is fine).
- Contains D at position 3 (D is not allowed at 2, so position 3 is fine).
- Uses I and O for the remaining slots, which have not been ruled out.

Thus “AUDIO” satisfies all known constraints.
