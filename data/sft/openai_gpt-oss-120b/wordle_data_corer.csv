### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1 → word starts with **C**.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word beginning with C, containing R and E in other positions, and avoiding A and N.  
A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **CLERK** (C L E R K):

- No A or N appear.

We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- **R** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → it can be at position 3 or 5.
- **E** is in the word but not in positions 5 or 3 → it can be at position 2 or 4.
- Letters **A, N, L, K** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter English word that starts with C, contains R and E in the allowed positions, and avoids the forbidden letters.

Trying placements:
- If E is at position 4, the pattern is C _ _ E _.  
- R can then be at position 5, giving C _ _ E R.

The word **CIDER** fits perfectly:
- C I D E R
- C is correct at position 1.
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus the next logical guess is **CIDER**.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1 → word starts with **C**.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word beginning with C, containing R and E in other positions, and avoiding A and N.  
A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **CLERK** (C L E R K):  
- C is first (✓)  
- R is fourth (not second)  
- E is third (not fifth)  
- No A or N appear.

So the next guess will be **CLERK**.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 1 is **C** (C✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → it can be at position 3 or 5.

- Letters **A, N, L, K** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter English word that starts with C, contains R and E in the allowed positions, and avoids the forbidden letters.

Trying placements:
- If E is at position 4, the pattern is C _ _ E _.  
- R can then be at position 5, giving C _ _ E R.

The word **CIDER** fits perfectly:
- C I D E R
- C is correct at position 1.
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus the next logical guess is **CIDER**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
