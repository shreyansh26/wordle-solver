### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word must start with **C**, contain an **N** somewhere other than the fourth slot, and exclude R, A, E.  
A strong candidate fitting these constraints is **CINCH** (C I N C H): it starts with C, places N in the third position (allowed), and uses only letters not ruled out.

We have determined the secret word pattern from the feedback:
- Position 1 is C (C✓).
- Position 5 is N (N✓).
- Letters R, A, E, H, L, O, W are not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (I-), so I must be in position 3 or 4.
- N is confirmed at position 5, satisfying its earlier “‑” clues.
- The second C in the second guess received a “‑”, which can be satisfied by the single C already being in the word (just in a different position).

A common English word that fits all these constraints is **CUMIN**:
C U M I N → C at position 1, I at position 4, N at position 5, and none of the eliminated letters appear.

Thus the next logical guess is CUMIN.
