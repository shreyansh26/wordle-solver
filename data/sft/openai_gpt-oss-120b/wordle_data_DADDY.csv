### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:

- Letters C, R, N, E, S, L, T are not in the word at all.
- Letter A is confirmed, and Y is confirmed.

We need a common English word fitting that pattern and using only allowed letters. “BAGGY” fits: B A G G Y, uses only allowed letters and matches the known positions.

To gain the most new information, we should pick a word that introduces letters we haven’t tested yet. “HAPPY” fits the pattern, adds the new letters H and P, and repeats only letters we already know (A and Y). It also avoids all excluded letters.

So the next guess will be “HAPPY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Position 2 is **A** (✓ from SALTY, HAPPY, BAGGY, FADDY).
- Position 3 is **D** (✓ from FADDY).
- Position 4 is **D** (✓ from FADDY).
- Position 5 is **Y** (✓ from SALTY, BAGGY, HAPPY, FADDY).
- Position 1 is **not** F (x from FADDY) and also not any of the letters previously eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, B, G, H, P, etc.

Thus the word pattern is **_ A D D Y**.  
The only common English words that fit this pattern and use only letters not yet ruled out are:

- **DADDY** (adds D in the first position, which hasn't been tested yet)
- **MADDY** (first letter M, but “Maddy” is more of a proper name)
- **CADDY** and **LADDY** are invalid because C and L have been eliminated.

The safest guess is **DADDY**, which tests the remaining plausible first letter D and would solve the puzzle if correct.
