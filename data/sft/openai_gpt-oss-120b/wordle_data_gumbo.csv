### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give informative feedback. ""CRANE"" is a frequently used starter because it includes three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I'll use that as my first guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, I, H, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter M is in the word but not in position 1.
- Letter G is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain M and G in other positions, plus three other letters not among the excluded set.

Choosing a word that respects these position constraints and uses only allowed letters, “GUMLY” works:
- G in position 1 (allowed, not position 3)
- M in position 3 (allowed, not position 1)
- U, L, Y are all letters we have not ruled out.

So “GUMLY” is a valid next guess.
