### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have feedback from the first guess SLATE:
- S is not in the word.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ L _ _ _. It must contain A and T, with A not at position 3 and T not at position 4. No S or E anywhere.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **ALLOT**:
- A is at position 1 (acceptable).
- L is at position 2 (matches the known correct spot).
- L at position 3 is allowed (no restriction on L repeats).
- O is a filler letter not ruled out.
- T is at position 5 (not position 4, satisfying the T clue).

All constraints are satisfied, so we will guess ALLOT.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1 = A (✓ from guess 2)
- Position 2 = L (✓ from guess 2)
- Position 5 = T (✓ from guess 2)

From guess 2 we also know:
- There is another L somewhere that is not in position 3.
- There is an O somewhere that is not in position 4.

Thus the pattern is **A L _ _ T**, with the remaining letters being an L and an O, placed in positions 3 and 4 but not in their guessed spots. The only arrangement that satisfies those constraints is **A L O L T**, which is not a common English word. 

Since a valid English word is required, we will try a plausible word that fits the known fixed letters and includes O, while allowing the second L to be elsewhere: **ALOFT** (A L O F T). This keeps A, L, O, T in the correct spots we know and introduces a new letter F for the unknown position.

We will submit “ALOFT” as the next guess.
