I will start with a common opening word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowel placements to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E.

The feedback tells me that the first four letters C, R, A, N are all correct and in the right positions. Only the fifth letter is unknown, and it is not E. I need a valid 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern **CRAN_**. Common possibilities are “CRANK” and “CRANS” (the plural of cran, a type of crane). “CRANK” is a well‑known word, so I’ll try that.
