### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word contains the letter E but not at the fifth position, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N anywhere. I need a new guess that includes E in a different position and avoids the eliminated letters. A good candidate is “SHELF”, which places E in the third position and uses letters S, H, L, and F that haven’t been ruled out.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1 = S (✓ from “shelf” and “stems”).
- Position 3 = E (✓ from “shelf” and “stems”).

Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, H, L, F, T, M.

Feedback from “stems” gave S at position 5 as “-”, meaning the letter S is in the word but not at position 5. Since we already have an S at position 1, that condition is satisfied; we do not need a second S.

Thus the current pattern is **S _ E _ _**, with the remaining slots (2, 4, 5) to be filled by letters other than those eliminated.

A good candidate that fits the pattern and avoids all excluded letters is **SWEEP**:
- S (pos 1) ✓ matches known S.
- W (pos 2) is a new letter, not eliminated.
- E (pos 3) ✓ matches known E.
- E (pos 4) repeats a known letter, which is allowed.
- P (pos 5) is a new letter, not eliminated.

This guess will test the new letters W and P while keeping the confirmed letters in place.
