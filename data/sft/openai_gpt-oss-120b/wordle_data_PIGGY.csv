### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that contains I and P, places I somewhere other than the 3rd slot and P somewhere other than the 5th slot, and uses only the allowed letters. “ZIPPY” satisfies all conditions:
- Letters Z, I, P, P, Y are all from the allowed set.
- I is in position 2 (not 3) and P appears in positions 3 and 4 (not 5).
- It is a common English word.

Thus “ZIPPY” is a logical next guess.

We have the following information from feedback:
- Letters eliminated (x): C, R, A, N, E, S, H, O, U, T, B, L, M, Z.
- I is correct in position 2 (✓).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).
- P is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from both BLIMP and ZIPPY). Since position 2 is I, the only remaining spot for P is position 1.
Thus the secret word pattern is: **P I _ _ Y**.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that have not been eliminated. Remaining possible letters include D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, and any other letters not yet ruled out. The word **PIGGY** fits the pattern (P I G G Y) and uses only letters that are still allowed.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""PIGGY"".
