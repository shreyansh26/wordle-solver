### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels to get the most information possible. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it includes three of the most common consonants (C, R, N) and both a vowel (A) and another vowel (E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain R and E, placed elsewhere. A good next guess should keep R and E (to test new positions) and introduce new common letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “RILED” does that:
- R is moved to position 1 (allowed).
- E is moved to position 4 (allowed).
- New letters I, L, D give us fresh information.
Thus “RILED” is a logical second guess.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, I, D.
- Letter E is in the word and is correct at position 4 (E✓).
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (both gave “-”), so R can be in position 3 or 5.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 3 (gave “-”), so L can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but position 4 is already taken by E).

Thus the secret word has the pattern:

1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 E 5 ?
with R in {3,5} and L in {1,2,5} (but if R occupies 5, L must be 1 or 2).

We need a guess that keeps the known letters in new positions and introduces new letters while respecting the constraints.  
The word **GLUER** fits perfectly:

- G (new) at position 1  
- L at position 2 (allowed)  
- U (new) at position 3  
- E at position 4 (already confirmed)  
- R at position 5 (allowed)

This will test R in position 5, L in position 2, and give us information about G and U.

This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain R and E, placed elsewhere. A good next guess should keep R and E (to test new positions) and introduce new common letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “RILED” does that:
- R is moved to position 1 (allowed).
- E is moved to position 4 (allowed).
- New letters I, L, D give us fresh information.
Thus “RILED” is a logical second guess.

Guess 2: RILED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓) D(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, I, D.
- Letter E is in the word and is correct at position 4 (E✓).
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (both gave “-”), so R can be in position 3 or 5.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 3 (gave “-”), so L can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but position 4 is already taken by E).

Thus the secret word has the pattern:

1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 E 5 ?
with R in {3,5} and L in {1,2,5} (but if R occupies 5, L must be 1 or 2).

We need a guess that keeps the known letters in new positions and introduces new letters while respecting the constraints.  
The word **GLUER** fits perfectly:

- G (new) at position 1  
- L at position 2 (allowed)  
- U (new) at position 3  
- E at position 4 (already confirmed)  
- R at position 5 (allowed)

This will test R in position 5, L in position 2, and give us information about G and U.

All other letters from previous guesses are excluded: C, A, N, I, D, G, U, plus any letters that received an “x”. 

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ L _ E R.

We need a valid English word with L second, E fourth, R fifth, using only allowable letters for the remaining spots. Possible candidates include **FLEER** (F L E E R) and **BLEER** (B L E E R). Both satisfy the known positions and avoid excluded letters. I’ll guess the more common of these, **FLEER**, to test the first and third letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
