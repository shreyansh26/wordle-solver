### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that covers a good mix of frequent letters is “SLATE”. This will give useful information about vowels and common consonants.

We know from the first guess that S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore the next guess must include an E somewhere in positions 1‑4 and avoid S, L, A, T entirely. A good candidate is **MOVER** (M O V E R), which places E in position 4 and introduces new letters to test.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Letters S, L, A, T, M, R are not in the word.
- The letter E is present but not in position 5 (from first guess).
- From the second guess (MOVER): O, V, and E are all correct in their positions:
  - Position 2 = O
  - Position 3 = V
  - Position 4 = E
Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ O V E _. 

We need a real 5‑letter English word matching that pattern, using letters not yet ruled out for positions 1 and 5. “COVEN” fits perfectly (C O V E N) and introduces two new letters, C and N, that haven’t been eliminated.

So the next guess should be **COVEN**.
