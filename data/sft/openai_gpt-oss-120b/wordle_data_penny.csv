### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common, information‑rich 5‑letter word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” uses two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N), which should give useful feedback about the secret word.

We know from the feedback:
- N is correct in position 4 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (‑), so it must be in position 1‑3.
- C, R, and A are not in the word (x).

Therefore the next guess must:
1. Have N at the 4th spot.
2. Include E somewhere other than the 5th spot.
3. Avoid C, R, A.

A good candidate is **SPENT**:
- Positions: S P E N T
- N is in the required 4th position.
- E appears in the 3rd position (not 5th).
- No prohibited letters are used.

This will test the presence and positions of S, P, and T while confirming N and E placements.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- N is correct at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at positions 3 or 5, so it can be at position 1 or 2.
- P is in the word but not at position 2, so it can be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **PENNY**:
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- P is at position 1 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus ""PENNY"" is a valid next guess.
