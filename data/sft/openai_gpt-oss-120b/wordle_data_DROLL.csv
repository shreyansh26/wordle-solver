### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ R O _ L.
Confirmed letters:
- Position2 = R (✓)
- Position3 = O (✓)
- Position5 = L (✓)

Letters ruled out (x): C, A, N, E, F, S, T, B, I, P, W, plus any others from previous guesses.

Thus the remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are any alphabet letters not in the excluded set and not already used, such as D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **DROOL** (D‑R‑O‑O‑L). It introduces D at position1 and repeats O at position4, which is permissible because O is confirmed at position3 and we have no evidence that O cannot also appear elsewhere.

Therefore the next guess should be DROOL.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: D (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: O is marked (-), meaning O is in the word but not here. So position 4 cannot be O.
- Position 5: L (✓)

Thus the secret word is D R O _ L, with the fourth letter being something other than O and not any of the letters previously marked as absent (C, A, N, E, F, S, T, B, I, P, W, O). Possible candidates include “DROLL”, which fits the pattern (D R O L L) and introduces only the already‑known letter L in a new position. “DROLL” is a valid English word, so it is a strong next guess.
