### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess that covers common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. A good starter word is “SLATE”, which includes the vowel A and common consonants S, L, T, and E.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that:
- A is correct at position 3.
- S, L, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (so S ≠ position 1, L ≠ position 2, E ≠ position 5).
- T is not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Has A at the third spot.
2. Includes the letters S, L, and E in other positions respecting the above constraints.
3. Does not contain T.

The word **LEASH** satisfies all conditions:
- Position 1 = L (L is allowed here; it was only ruled out from position 2).
- Position 2 = E (E is allowed here; it was only ruled out from position 5).
- Position 3 = A (matches the known correct placement).
- Position 4 = S (S is allowed here; it was only ruled out from position 1).
- Position 5 = H (a new letter, and E is not placed at position 5).

Thus “LEASH” is a valid next guess.
