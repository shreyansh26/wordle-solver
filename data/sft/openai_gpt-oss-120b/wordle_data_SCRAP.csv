### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters in different positions. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes S, L, A, T, and E, covering several frequent letters and positions.

We know from the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word starts with S, contains an A somewhere other than the third slot, and must avoid L, T, and E.

Choosing a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters, ""SANDY"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 2 (not position 3).
- Contains no L, T, or E.
- Introduces N, D, Y for further clues.

We have:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L, T, E, N, D, Y are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so A must be in position 4 or 5.
We need a 5‑letter word starting with S, with A at position 4 or 5, and using only letters not ruled out.  
Word “SCRAP” fits: S (position 1), C, R, A (position 4), P. None of C, R, P have been eliminated, and A is in the allowed slot.
