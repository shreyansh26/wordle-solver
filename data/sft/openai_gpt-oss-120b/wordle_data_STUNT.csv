### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We have determined the secret word's known letters:

- Position 3 = U (from BLUNT)
- Position 4 = N (confirmed by both guesses)
- Position 5 = T (from BLUNT)

The letters C, R, A, E, B, L are all not in the word at any position.

Thus the pattern is **_ _ U N T**. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet excluded is **SHUNT** (S‑H‑U‑N‑T). This will test the remaining unknown letters while keeping the confirmed ones in place.
