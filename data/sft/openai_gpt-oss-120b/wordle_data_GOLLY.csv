### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess I want a word that contains several of the most common letters in English and also has a mix of vowels and consonants. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, “AUDIO”, and “ROAST” are popular starters. I’ll choose **CRANE** because it covers the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving a good chance of hitting some correct letters or positions.

We have the following feedback:
- CRANE: all letters absent → eliminate C, R, A, N, E.
- THUMP: all letters absent → eliminate T, H, U, M, P.
- BLOWS: B absent, L present but not in position 2, O present but not in position 3, W absent, S absent.
- FOLIO: F absent, O correct in position 2, L correct in position 3, I absent, second O marked “-” (letter is in the word but wrong spot), indicating there may be another O elsewhere (not position 5).

Thus we know:
- Position 2 = O (green)
- Position 3 = L (green)
- Position 5 cannot be O.
- Letters eliminated so far: A, B, C, E, F, H, I, M, N, P, R, S, T, U, W.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
