### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, giving me useful information for the next guesses. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle‑style games because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should provide a good spread of feedback.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, N, and places A somewhere other than the 3rd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot.

""ADEPT"" satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 3), both not in the prohibited positions.
- Uses letters D, P, T that we have no information about yet.
- Excludes C, R, N.

Thus ""ADEPT"" is a logical second guess.

- E cannot be in positions 3 (from ADEPT) or 5 (from CRANE). So E can be 1, 2, or 4.

We need a valid 5‑letter word that contains A and E in allowed positions and does not use any excluded letters.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, N, and places A somewhere other than the 3rd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot.

""ADEPT"" satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 3), both not in the prohibited positions.
- Uses letters D, P, T that we have no information about yet.
- Excludes C, R, N.

Thus ""ADEPT"" is a logical second guess.

Guess 2: ADEPT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, D, P, T.
- Letters that are in the word: A and E.

Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 (from ADEPT) or 3 (from CRANE). So A can be 2, 4, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 3 (from ADEPT) or 5 (from CRANE). So E can be 1, 2, or 4.

We need a valid 5‑letter word that contains A and E in allowed positions and does not use any excluded letters.  

The word **MALES** fits:
- Contains A (position 2) – allowed.
- Contains E (position 4) – allowed.
- Uses letters M, L, S, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus “MALES” is a good next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, D, P, T, M, L, S. Remaining possible letters are A, E, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Position constraints from feedback:
- A cannot be in positions 1 (ADEPT), 2 (MALES), or 3 (CRANE). So A can be only in positions 4 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 3 (ADEPT), 4 (MALES), or 5 (CRANE). So E can be only in positions 1 or 2.

We need a word containing A and E in allowed slots and using only allowed letters otherwise. One word that satisfies this is **KEBAB**:
- Pattern: K E B A B
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- All other letters (K, B) are from the allowed set and not previously eliminated.

Thus “KEBAB” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 4.
- E is confirmed at position 1 (cannot be 2,3,4,5).
- S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 2 or 3.
All other letters marked “x” are not in the word.

A word that fits these constraints is **ESSAY** (E S S A Y):
- E at position 1, A at position 4.
- Contains S (positions 2 and 3), not at position 5.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (Y is still possible).

Thus “ESSAY” satisfies all known clues and is a strong next guess.
