### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Remaining possible letters are: **B D E F G H I J K Q S W X Y Z**.

To narrow down the exact letters and positions, we should probe several of the still‑unknown letters while keeping **S** in the guess (since we know it belongs in the word). A good word that uses only allowed letters and places **S** away from the first position is **WHISK** (W‑H‑I‑S‑K).

We have determined:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) from all previous guesses.
- The letter **S** is in the word but not at position 1 (from STOVE) and is confirmed at position 4 (from WHISK), giving the pattern ___SE.
- Letters ruled out (not present anywhere) are: A, C, R, N, P, L, U, M, T, O, V, W, H, I, K, and also from earlier guesses C,R,A,N,P,L,U,M,T,O,V,W,H,I,K.
- Remaining possible letters for the first three positions are limited to B, D, F, G, J, Q, X, Y, Z (and possibly others not yet excluded).

We need a valid 5‑letter English word fitting ___SE using only allowed letters. A reasonable candidate that tests new letters while respecting the known placement is **FESSE** (F E S S E). This introduces the letter F and places E in position 2, which we have not yet tested, and keeps S at position 4 and E at position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C x, R x, A x, N x, E ✓ → E is correct at position 5.
2. PLUME → P x, L x, U x, M x, E ✓ → confirms E at position 5; other letters excluded.
3. STOVE → S - (present but not at position 1), T x, O x, V x, E ✓ → S is in the word, not in slot 1.
4. WHISK → W x, H x, I x, S ✓, K x → S is confirmed at position 4.
5. FESSE → F x, E ✓ (position 2), S - (S not at position 3), S ✓ (position 4), E ✓ (position 5) → confirms E at position 2 as well, S at position 4, and E at position 5.

Thus the pattern is: **_ E _ S E**, with letters confirmed:
- Position 2 = E
- Position 4 = S
- Position 5 = E
- S is not in positions 1 or 3

Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere): C, R, A, N, P, L, U, M, T, O, V, W, H, I, K, F, and also the x‑marked letters from earlier guesses (C,R,A,N,P,L,U,M,T,O,V,W,H,I,K,F). Remaining candidate letters for positions 1 and 3 are among B, D, G, J, Q, X, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting **_E_SE** with allowed letters is **GEESE** (G E E S E). This uses G (still possible) and places an additional E at position 3, which we have not yet tested.

Therefore the next logical guess is **GEESE**.
