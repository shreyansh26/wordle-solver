### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- **L** is in the word but not in position 3; therefore L is either position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, A, N, M, Y, U, plus any letters marked “x” in earlier guesses.

We need a word of the form _ _ _ E R that contains L (not at position 3) and uses none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate that tests whether L is in position 2 and introduces new letters is **FLIER** (F L I E R).

We have determined the exact positions of several letters:

- Position 4 = **E** (✓ from guesses 3 and 4).
- Position 5 = **R** (✓ from guesses 3 and 4).
- Letter **L** is in the word but was shown not to be in positions 2, 3 (dash in guesses 3 and 4). Therefore L must be at position 1.
- All letters marked “x” are not in the word: C, A, N, M, Y, U, F, I, plus any others already ruled out.

So the secret word fits the pattern **L _ _ E R** with the middle two letters not being any of the excluded letters. Viable common English words matching this pattern are limited; “LOVER” (L‑O‑V‑E‑R) satisfies all constraints, using new letters O and V that have not been eliminated.

Thus the next logical guess is **LOVER**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
