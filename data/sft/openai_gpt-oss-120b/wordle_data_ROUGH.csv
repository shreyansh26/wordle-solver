### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from feedback: C, A, N, E are not in the secret word. The letter R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains R (not in the second slot) and avoids C, A, N, E. Choose a word that introduces several new letters to gather more info.

“RUSTY” fits:
- R is at position 1 (allowed)
- Contains new letters U, S, T, Y which have not been tested yet
- Does not contain C, A, N, E

Thus it is a good next guess.

We have the following feedback:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, A, N, E are NOT in the word. R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- From guess 2 (RUSTY): R is correct at position 1. U is in the word but NOT in position 2. S, T, Y are NOT in the word.

Thus far we know:
- The secret word starts with **R**.
- The letter **U** appears somewhere in positions 3‑5 (it cannot be position 2 and it is not at position 1 because R occupies that spot).
- The letters **C, A, N, E, S, T, Y** are all ruled out.

We need a new guess that keeps R in the first position, includes U in a non‑second slot, and introduces new letters while avoiding the excluded ones.  
The word **ROUGH** satisfies all constraints:
- R is still at position 1 (✓).
- U is at position 3 (allowed, and we’ll learn its exact placement).
- O, G, H are letters we haven’t tested yet.
- None of the forbidden letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess should be “ROUGH”.
