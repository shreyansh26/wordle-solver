### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to give useful information for the next guesses. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter that covers two vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N). I'll use that as my first guess.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A. It does contain N and E, but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5 (their positions in the guess CRANE). To test those letters in new positions and gather more information, I’ll pick a word that includes N and E in different spots and introduces new letters. ""ENJOY"" places E at position 1 and N at position 2, satisfying the constraints, and adds J, O, Y for more clues.

From the feedback:
- Positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed as E, N, O, Y respectively.
- The only unknown is the third letter.
The pattern is EN?OY. The word ""ENVOY"" fits this pattern and uses a letter (V) not yet ruled out. It is a valid English word.
