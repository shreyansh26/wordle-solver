I will start with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and varied positions to gather information. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess.

We know from feedback: Position 1 is C (✓). R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4. Thus N must be in position 2, 3, or 5. We need a new guess with C first, includes N in one of those spots, and avoids R, A, E. ""CONDO"" fits: C at 1, N at 3, no R/A/E, and uses common letters.
