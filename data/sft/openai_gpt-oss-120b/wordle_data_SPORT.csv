### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Positions 1 (S), 3 (O), and 4 (R) are correct.
- Position 5 is not Y, and T is in the word but not in position 2, so T must be position 5.
- Therefore the word pattern is S _ O R T, with the missing letter at position 2.
- The missing letter cannot be any that have been marked x: C, A, N, E, M, H, P, W, D, Y, etc.
- The only common word fitting S?ORT with allowed letters is **SKORT** (letter K is still untested).
Thus the next guess should be SKORT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- The secret word does NOT contain C, A, N, E.
- It DOES contain R, but NOT in position 2 (the position it was in during “CRANE”).

We need a new guess that respects these constraints, uses fresh letters to gather more info, and places R in a different position (1,3,4,5). A good candidate is **MORPH**:
- It contains R at position 3, which is allowed.
- It introduces new letters M, O, P, H, none of which have been ruled out yet.
Thus it maximizes information gain.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have these constraints:
- Letters ruled out (x): C, A, N, E, M, H.
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 2 (from MORPH). So O can be 1,3,4,5.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and MORPH). So R can be 1,4,5.
We need a new guess that includes O and R in allowed positions and introduces new letters to gain info while avoiding disallowed letters.

Word “SWORD” fits:
- O is at position 3 (allowed).
- R is at position 4 (allowed).
- New letters S, W, D have not been tested yet.
Thus it respects all known constraints and maximizes information gain.

We need a common 5‑letter word matching that pattern and using only letters not yet eliminated. “STORY” (S‑T‑O‑R‑Y) fits perfectly: T and Y have not been ruled out, and all other positions match known information. This guess will confirm the remaining letters.
