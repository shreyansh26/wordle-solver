### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the following:
- N is correct at position 4.
- O is correct at position 3, and O cannot be at position 2.
- T is present in the word but not at position 2, so T must be at position 1 or 5.
- All other tested letters (C, R, A, E, B, L, I, K, M, U, D, S, Y) are not in the word.

The pattern is: _ _ O N _.  
We need a word that fits this pattern, includes T either at position 1 or 5, and introduces new letters for the remaining unknown positions.

The word **THONG** fits:
- T at position 1 (allowed, T not at position 2).
- H at position 2 (new, not yet tested).
- O at position 3 (matches known O).
- N at position 4 (matches known N).
- G at position 5 (new, not yet tested).

Thus THONG is a valid next guess.
