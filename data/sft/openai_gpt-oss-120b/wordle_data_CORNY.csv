I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common, vowel‑rich starter that can give me information about both consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a frequent opening guess because it contains the common letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering a mix of frequent consonants and the vowel A (plus the vowel E). This should provide useful feedback for my next guesses.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 4.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A and E are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like: C _ _ N _.  
R must appear in either position 3 or 5.  
We need a common 5‑letter word with C at the start, N fourth, containing R elsewhere, and avoiding A and E.

“CORNY” fits: C‑O‑R‑N‑Y (R is in position 3, C and N are fixed, and no A/E).
Thus the next guess is “CORNY”.
