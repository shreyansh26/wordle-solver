### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter R is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2 (so R can be 3, 4, or 5).
- Letter S is in the word but not at position 5 (so S can be 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters C, N, E, I are not in the word.
We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ A _ _ _ that contains both R and S in allowed spots and avoids the forbidden letters.  

“MARSH” fits:
- A is at position 2.
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- S is at position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- None of the excluded letters appear.
It also introduces new letters M and H to gather more information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 2 is definitely **A**.
- Letter **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letter **S** is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, E, I, M, L, H, and also we already know C, N, E, I, M, L, H are out.

Possible layouts:
1. S A _ R _
2. S A _ _ R
3. _ A S R _
4. _ A S _ R

Looking for a common English word that fits these patterns, avoids all excluded letters, and uses only allowed letters (B, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.).

The word **SAURY** fits pattern 1 (S A _ R _):
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).
- R is in position 4 (allowed for R).
- U and Y are new letters and are not among the excluded set.
- “Saury” is a valid English word (a type of fish).

Thus SAURY satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters to test.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
