### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these word‑guessing games because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering a common vowel (A, E) and frequent consonants. This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know:
- The secret word ends with **E** (E is correct in position 5).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was “‑” in CRANE).
- Letters **C, A, N** are not in the word at all.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in E, containing R somewhere other than the second slot, and avoiding C, A, N. “FORGE” fits: 
- Pattern **_ _ R _ E** (R in position 3, allowed). 
- No prohibited letters. 
Thus “FORGE” is a solid next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern so far:
- Position 5 is E (from CRANE).
- Position 3 is R and Position 4 is G (both correct from FORGE).
- Letters C, A, N, F, O are not in the word.
So the word looks like __RGE.

We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 2. Good candidates that fit the pattern and use new letters are:
- SURGE (S, U)
- DIRGE (D, I)
- PURGE (P, U)
- VERGE (V, E) (though E would repeat)

Choosing SURGE introduces two fresh letters (S and U) and keeps the known correct ending, giving maximum new information.

Thus the next guess will be SURGE.
