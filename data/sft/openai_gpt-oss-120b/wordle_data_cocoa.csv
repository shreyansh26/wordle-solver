### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word. The letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (the third slot of SLATE). Therefore the secret contains A somewhere in positions 1,2,4, or5. For the next guess we should avoid S, L, T, E and include A in a different position to test. A good candidate is ""MANGO"": it uses new letters M, N, G, O plus A (in position 2), which respects the constraint that A is not at position 3.

We have determined which letters are not in the secret word: S, L, T, E, M, N, G.  
Letter A is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
Letter O is present but cannot be in position 5, so O can be in positions 1‑4.  

We need a new guess that includes A and O in allowed spots and introduces new, untested letters while avoiding the excluded ones.  
The word “ARROW” satisfies these constraints:
- A is placed in position 1 (allowed for A).
- O is placed in position 4 (allowed for O, not position 5).
- It introduces the new letters R and W, both of which have not been ruled out.
Thus “ARROW” is a good next guess.
