### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the exact positions for three letters:
- O is correct at position 2.
- R is correct at position 3.
- A is correct at position 4.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ O R A _. 

Letters that cannot appear anywhere (based on prior feedback) are: C, N, E, D, I, T, H, M, L.

We need a common 5‑letter word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters for positions 1 and 5.

Possible candidates include:
- FORAY (F O R A Y)
- BORAX (B O R A X)

Both use letters not yet excluded. I will guess **BORAX**.
