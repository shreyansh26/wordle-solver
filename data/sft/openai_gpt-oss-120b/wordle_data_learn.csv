### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have feedback: C is not in the word, R is in the word but not in position 2, A is correct in position 3, N is in the word but not in position 4, and E is not in the word.  
So the secret word must have A as the third letter, contain R and N elsewhere (R not at 2, N not at 4), and must not contain C or E.  
A good candidate that meets these constraints is **SNARL** (S N A R L):  
- A is in position 3.  
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since N just can’t be 4).  
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since R just can’t be 2).  
- No C or E are present.  
Thus we’ll guess SNARL.

From the feedback:
- A is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 4.
- C is not in the word.
- R is elsewhere (already placed at 4).
- N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → can be 1 or 5.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.
- From the second guess: S is not in the word, N is elsewhere (still not 2), L is in the word but not at position 5.
Thus the remaining letters to place are L, N, and E in positions 1, 2, and 5, respecting:
- Position 5 cannot be E or L (both marked “-” at that spot), so it must be N.
- Position 2 cannot be N (dash on N) and can be L or E.
- Position 1 then takes the remaining letter.
The arrangement L‑E‑A‑R‑N satisfies all constraints and forms a valid English word.

So the next guess is **LEARN**.
