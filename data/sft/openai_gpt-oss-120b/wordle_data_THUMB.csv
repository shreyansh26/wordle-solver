### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want a word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. A popular starting word in Wordle-like games is “CRANE” because it includes three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give me a good base of feedback for the next guesses.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely while still using common letters to gather more information. “SLOTH” contains S, L, O, T, H – none of which have been ruled out yet, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

We have ruled out letters C,R,A,N,E,S,L,O. The letters T and H are confirmed present but in the wrong positions (T not position 4, H not position 5). We need a new guess that includes T and H in different positions and introduces new, untested letters while avoiding the excluded ones. The word “THUMB” places T at position 1 (allowed) and H at position 2 (allowed), and adds U, M, B – all letters not yet tested. This will give information about the remaining unknown letters and also confirm the positions of T and H.
