### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need to choose a new 5‑letter word that avoids all of those letters. I’ll pick a common word with entirely different letters such as “LIMBS” (L, I, M, B, S), which contains none of the excluded letters.

We have eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, I, M. From the second guess, B and S are in the word but are in wrong positions: B is not in position 4, S is not in position 5. We need a word containing B and S in different positions, avoiding all eliminated letters. A good candidate is **BUSHY** (B at 1, S at 3), which satisfies the position constraints and uses only new letters U, H, Y that have not been ruled out.
