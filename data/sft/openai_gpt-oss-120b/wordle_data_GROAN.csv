### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- R is correct at position 2.
- A and N are in the word but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- C and E are not in the word.

We need a new word with R in the second slot, containing A and N in different positions (A not at 3, N not at 4), and avoiding C and E.  

A good candidate is **ORGAN**:
- Pattern O R G A N fits R = 2.
- A is at position 4 (allowed).
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters O and G for more information.
Thus we guess ORGAN.

From feedback:
- R is correct at position 2.
- A is correct at position 4.
- N is correct at position 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 1 (so could be 3).
- G is in the word but not at position 3 (so could be 1).
Thus the word pattern is _ R _ A N, with remaining letters O and G to place. The only arrangement that satisfies the constraints is G R O A N → ""GROAN"".
