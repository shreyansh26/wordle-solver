### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, and places R and E in positions different from those ruled out. 

""BERTH"" satisfies these conditions:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 2), both away from their prohibited spots.
- Uses none of the excluded letters C, A, N.
- Is a valid English word.

Thus ""BERTH"" is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERTH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) R(-) T(x) H(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:

- Letters not in the word: B, C, A, N, T, H, plus any others marked x.
- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses). So R can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Remaining possible letters are any that haven’t been eliminated.

We need a valid 5‑letter word with E at the second spot, containing R in one of the allowed positions, and avoiding all eliminated letters. 

The word **DEFER** fits:
- Pattern D E F E R → E is at position 2.
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters appear.
- Introduces new letters D and F for more information.

Thus the next guess will be DEFER.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information from previous feedback:

- Position 2: E (✓)  
- Position 4: E (✓)  
- Position 5: R (✓)  

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **_ E _ E R**.

Letters eliminated (marked x) are: C, A, N, B, T, H, D, F, plus any other letters not yet tried. Therefore the remaining unknown letters for positions 1 and 3 must be chosen from the alphabet excluding those eliminated.

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ E _ E R** and uses only allowable letters is **LEVER** (L‑E‑V‑E‑R).  
- L and V have not been eliminated.  
- The word is a valid 5‑letter English word.

Hence the next logical guess is **LEVER**.

Only position 3 is unknown. Eliminated letters so far are C, A, N, B, T, H, D, F, V. The letter P has not been ruled out and forms the valid English word **LEPER** (L‑E‑P‑E‑R). This fits the pattern L E _ E R and introduces a new letter for testing.
