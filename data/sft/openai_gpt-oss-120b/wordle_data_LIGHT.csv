### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback on SLATE:
- S, A, E are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the next guess must:
1. Include L and T, but place them in different positions (L ≠ 2, T ≠ 4).
2. Exclude S, A, E.
3. Test new letters.

The word **TULIP** satisfies these constraints:
- T is at position 1 (allowed, not 4).
- L is at position 3 (allowed, not 2).
- No forbidden letters (S, A, E) appear.
- Introduces new letters U, I, P for further information.

Thus, “TULIP” is a suitable next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This will give me useful feedback for future guesses. “SLATE” is a good starter word because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). I’ll submit that as my first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback on SLATE:
- S, A, E are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the next guess must:
1. Include L and T, but place them in different positions (L ≠ 2, T ≠ 4).
2. Exclude S, A, E.
3. Test new letters.

The word **TULIP** satisfies these constraints:
- T is at position 1 (allowed, not 4).
- L is at position 3 (allowed, not 2).
- No forbidden letters (S, A, E) appear.
- Introduces new letters U, I, P for further information.

Thus, “TULIP” is a suitable next guess.

<guess>TULIP</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TULIP -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(x) L(-) I(-) P(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From SLATE: S, A, E are not in the word; L is present but not position 2; T is present but not position 4.
- From TULIP: U, I, P are not in the word; T is present but not position 1; L is present but not position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain **L** and **T**, with:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions for L: 1, 4, 5.
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5.

All other letters used so far (S, A, E, U, I, P) are excluded.

Looking for a 5‑letter English word using only the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z) that contains L and T in allowed slots.

The word **HOTLY** fits:
- H O T L Y
- T is in position 3 (allowed), L is in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus “HOTLY” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TULIP -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(x) L(-) I(-) P(x)
Guess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(-) O(x) T(-) L(-) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from previous feedback:
- Present letters: H, L, T (each shown as “-”, meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed positions).
- Excluded letters: S, A, E, U, I, P, O, Y (all marked “x”).

Positional constraints:
- H is NOT in position 1.
- L is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → L can be only position 1 or 5.
- T is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 → T can be only position 2 or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **ETHYL**:
- L is at position 5 (allowed).
- T is at position 2 (allowed).
- H is at position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- The remaining letters E and Y are already known to be absent, but including them will confirm their exclusion.

Thus ETHYL is a legal guess that tests the placements of H, L, and T while also re‑checking E and Y.

We have the following constraints based on feedback:

- L is in the word, not in positions 2,3,4,5 → L must be position 1.
- T is in the word, not in positions 1,2,3,4 → T must be position 5.
- H is in the word, not in positions 1 or 3 → H can be position 2 or 4.
- I is in the word, not in position 4 (from TULIP) → I can be position 2 or 3.
- All letters S, A, E, U, P, O, Y, and any other marked ‘x’ are excluded.

The only arrangement that satisfies all positional limits and uses only allowed letters is:
L I G H T  
(L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5).  
‘G’ has not been ruled out, so “LIGHT” fits all constraints and introduces a new letter (G) for further information.

Thus the next guess should be **LIGHT**.
