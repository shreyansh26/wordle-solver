### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- L, A, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes S and T in different positions, avoids L, A, E, and introduces new letters to gather more info. “TRUST” satisfies these conditions:

- Position 5 = T
- The word contains U (not at position 3) → must be at position 1 or 2.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, E, R.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form **_ _ _ S T** with U in slot 1 or 2 and no prohibited letters.

- Fits the pattern (U is in position 2, not position 3).
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Ends with “ST” as required.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- L, A, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes S and T in different positions, avoids L, A, E, and introduces new letters to gather more info. “TRUST” satisfies these conditions:
- T at position 1 (allowed, T isn’t excluded from position 1).
- S at position 4 (allowed, S isn’t excluded from position 4).
- Contains new letters R and U for further clues.
- No prohibited letters (L, A, E).

Thus the next guess will be “TRUST”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRUST -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) U(-) S(✓) T(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S is in the word but not position 1; L, A, E are not in the word; T is in the word but not position 4.
- From TRUST: T is in the word but not position 1 (the “-” on the first T), R is not in the word, U is in the word but not position 3, S is correctly placed at position 4, and T is correctly placed at position 5.

So far we know:
- Position 4 = S
- Position 5 = T
- The word contains U (not at position 3) → must be at position 1 or 2.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, E, R.
- The word may contain another T, but the single T at position 5 already satisfies the “‑” clues for the other Ts.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form **_ _ _ S T** with U in slot 1 or 2 and no prohibited letters.  
A good candidate is **QUIST** (Q U I S T):
- Fits the pattern (U is in position 2, not position 3).
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Ends with “ST” as required.

Thus we will guess **QUIST** next.

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: L, A, E, R, Q, I, (and also from earlier feedback) L, A, E, R, Q, I, plus any other letters that received an “x” in earlier guesses.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **_ U _ S T** with unknown letters at positions 1 and 3. To gain information about those two spots while staying consistent with all known constraints, a good next guess is **DUNST** (D U N S T). This introduces new letters D and N for positions 1 and 3, respectively, and keeps the confirmed letters in place.

If any of D or N are correct (or present elsewhere), the feedback will guide the final guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
