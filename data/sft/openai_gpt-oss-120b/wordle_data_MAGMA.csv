### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:
- Known correct letters: M at position 1, A at position 2 (from MASTS).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, T (from previous feedback).
- A cannot be in position 3 (already known from CRANE feedback).

Thus the secret word pattern is **M A _ _ _**, using only letters that have not been ruled out.  
To learn about the remaining three letters, we should guess a word that keeps the known M A and introduces three new, allowable letters.  
A suitable word is **MALIK** (introducing L, I, K), all of which are not in the excluded list.

We have fixed letters M (position 1) and A (position 2). Feedback shows D is not in the word, and there is an extra A (not in position 4) and an extra M (not in position 5). Therefore the secret word must contain at least two As and two Ms, with the remaining three positions (3‑5) holding one more A, one more M, and one new letter.

Valid patterns:
- M A M ? A
- M A ? M A

Both satisfy the placement restrictions (A cannot be in 4, M cannot be in 5).

Choosing a common English word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet excluded, “MAGMA” (M A G M A) fits the second pattern. The new letter G has not been ruled out.
