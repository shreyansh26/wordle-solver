### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word, while N is present but not in the fourth position. The next guess should therefore:
- Include N, but not at position 4.

A good candidate is **UNZIP**:

We know from the feedback:

- Other options like ONSET or ONION contain banned letters (E, I) or repeated banned letters.

SNOWY satisfies the constraints and introduces four new letters to test (S, O, W, Y).

We have confirmed that S is correct in position 1 and N is correct in position 2. All other letters guessed so far (C,R,A,E,U,Z,I,P,O,W,Y) have received an “x”, meaning they are not in the secret word. This leaves only consonants for the remaining three slots, which makes it impossible to form a regular English word (a vowel is required). Therefore, it’s likely that one of the previous “x” markings was a false negative due to duplicate‑letter handling. To resolve this, we should test a word that re‑introduces a vowel that has been ruled out, while keeping the known greens S and N in place. 

A good candidate is **SNORE** (S N O R E), which includes the vowel O and also the letters R and E that were previously marked “x”. This guess will tell us whether any of those letters are actually present.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed that S is correct in position 1 and N is correct in position 2. All other letters guessed so far (C,R,A,E,U,Z,I,P,O,W,Y) have received an “x”, meaning they are not in the secret word. This leaves only consonants for the remaining three slots, which makes it impossible to form a regular English word (a vowel is required). Therefore, it’s likely that one of the previous “x” markings was a false negative due to duplicate‑letter handling. To resolve this, we should test a word that re‑introduces a vowel that has been ruled out, while keeping the known greens S and N in place. 

A good candidate is **SNORE** (S N O R E), which includes the vowel O and also the letters R and E that were previously marked “x”. This guess will tell us whether any of those letters are actually present.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Consider common words with N second:
