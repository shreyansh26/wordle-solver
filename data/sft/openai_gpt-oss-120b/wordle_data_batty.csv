We have the following confirmed information from feedback:
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- Position 3 is T (✓).
- Position 4 is T (✓).
- Position 5 is Y (✓).
- Letters eliminated (x): S, L, E, F, I, H, C, N, O, R.
Thus the secret word must be of the form _ A T T Y. The only common English word fitting this pattern that does not use any eliminated letters is **BATTY** (B A T T Y). B has not been ruled out yet, so it is a valid guess.
