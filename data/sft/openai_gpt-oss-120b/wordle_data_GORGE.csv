### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- The letter **E** is correct in the 5th position.
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in position 2.
- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that ends with **E**, includes **R** somewhere other than the second slot, and avoids C, A, N. A good candidate is **ROUGE** (R‑O‑U‑G‑E): it ends with E, places R at position 1 (not position 2), and introduces fresh letters O, U, G for more information while respecting the exclusions.
