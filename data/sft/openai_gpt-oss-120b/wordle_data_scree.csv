### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE:

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **C** and **R** somewhere else (C not first, R not second), and contains no A or N.

A common 5‑letter word satisfying these constraints is **FORCE**:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R in position 3 and C in position 4 (both not in the prohibited positions).
- Uses no A or N.

So we’ll guess “FORCE”.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 5 = E (from both guesses).
- Position 3 = R (✓ from FORCE).
- The letter C is in the word but not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 4 (from FORCE). Therefore C must be at position 2.
- Letters A, N, F, O are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ C R _ E, with the remaining unknown letters not being A, N, F, O.

A common English word that fits this pattern and respects all constraints is **SCREE** (S C R E E). It places C in position 2, R in position 3, ends with E, and uses only allowed letters.

Thus the next guess should be SCREE.
