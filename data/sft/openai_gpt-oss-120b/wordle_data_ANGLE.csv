### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the previous feedback:
- C and R are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (A was 3rd, N was 4th), so A ≠ position 3 and N ≠ position 4.
- The last letter is E.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E, containing A and N (in allowed positions), and avoiding C and R. “NAIVE” fits: N 1, A 2, I 3, V 4, E 5. It respects all constraints and introduces two new letters (I, V) for extra information.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 5 must be **E** (✓ from both guesses).
- The letters **A** and **N** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in prior guesses:
  * A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) nor position 2 (from NAIVE). So A can be in position 1 or 4.
  * N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) nor position 1 (from NAIVE). So N can be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, I, V.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E, containing A and N in allowed slots, and avoiding C, R, I, V.  

The pattern **A N _ _ E** satisfies all constraints (A at 1, N at 2, E at 5). A common word that matches is **ANGLE**. It introduces two new letters (G, L) which are not ruled out yet.

Thus the next guess should be ANGLE.
