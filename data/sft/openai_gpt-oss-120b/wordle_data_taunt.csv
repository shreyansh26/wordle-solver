### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C, R, E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct and in the 4th position.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the secret word must follow pattern: _ _ _ N _. It must contain an A somewhere other than the 3rd slot, and cannot contain C, R, or E anywhere.

We need a common 5‑letter English word that satisfies these constraints. “MANNA” fits:
- Positions: M(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) A(5) → N is indeed at position 4.
- Contains A (positions 2 and 5), not at position 3.
- No C, R, or E letters.

- Letters C, R, E, M are not in the word (x feedback).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C, R, E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct and in the 4th position.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the secret word must follow pattern: _ _ _ N _. It must contain an A somewhere other than the 3rd slot, and cannot contain C, R, or E anywhere.

We need a common 5‑letter English word that satisfies these constraints. “MANNA” fits:
- Positions: M(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) A(5) → N is indeed at position 4.
- Contains A (positions 2 and 5), not at position 3.
- No C, R, or E letters.

Thus “MANNA” is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:
- Position 2 is A (✓ from MANNA).
- Position 4 is N (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, E, M are not in the word (x feedback).
- The word can contain other letters, and we need to test possibilities that fit the pattern _ A _ N _.

A common English word that satisfies these constraints is **FAINT**:
- F A I N T
- A is in the correct second position.
- N is in the correct fourth position.
- No forbidden letters (C, R, E, M) appear.

Thus FAINT is a logical next guess.
