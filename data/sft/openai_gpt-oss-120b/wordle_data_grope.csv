We have confirmed letters:
- R at position 2 (✓ in all guesses)
- O at position 3 (✓ from PROLE)
- E at position 5 (✓ from all guesses)
- P is in the word but not at position 1 (‑ from PROLE). Since positions 2,3,5 are occupied, P must be at position 4.
Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ R O P E.

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""GROPE"".
