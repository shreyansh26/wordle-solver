### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the word but each is in a different position than guessed.
  * R was in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2 now.
  * A was in position 3, so A cannot be in position 3 now.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
- Contains R and A (since they are confirmed present).
- Does not place R in position 2 or A in position 3.
- Excludes the letters C, N, E.

A good candidate is **RADIO**:
- Contains both R and A.
- R is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters D, I, O, which have not been ruled out yet.
- Avoids C, N, E entirely.

Thus we will guess “RADIO”.
