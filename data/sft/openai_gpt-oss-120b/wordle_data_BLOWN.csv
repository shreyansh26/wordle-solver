### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess “CRANE” tells us:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Therefore the secret word must contain N in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, and must avoid C, R, A, E entirely.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- Letters C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T are not in the word.
- N is in the word, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from CRANE N not 4th; from NIGHT N not 1st). So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Actually NIGHT showed N not in position 1, so N can be 2,3,5. Position 4 already ruled out, position 1 ruled out.
We need a new guess that includes N in a possible position and uses only letters not yet eliminated. Choose a word that places N at position 3 (reasonable) and introduces new letters to test: F, U, D, S are all unused and allowed.

Word ""FUNDS"": F U N D S
- N is at position 3 (allowed).
- F, U, D, S have not been ruled out.
Thus this guess gives us information about those letters and confirms N's placement.

- All other letters K, O, L are from the allowed set.
Thus it will test new letters while respecting the constraints.

We have deduced:
- O is correctly placed at position 3.
- N is present and cannot be in positions 1‑4, so N must be at position 5.
- L is present but not in positions 4 or 5, so L must be in position 1, 2, or possibly both.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T, F, U, D, S, K, plus any others from earlier feedback.
- Remaining possible letters: B, J, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word pattern is _ _ O _ N with an L somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
A common word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **BLOWN** (B L O W N).
This tests new letters B and W while satisfying all constraints.

Thus the next guess is BLOWN.
