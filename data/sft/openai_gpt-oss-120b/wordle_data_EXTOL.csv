### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells me that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E, placed somewhere other than the fifth slot.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

- Required letters (present somewhere): **E** (not in positions 3, 4, 5) and **L** (not in position 2).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep **E** in a different position (preferably position 2, which is allowed).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The feedback from the first guess tells me that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E, placed somewhere other than the fifth slot.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""BLEED"": it contains E at positions 3 and 4 (both not position 5), and uses new letters B, L, and D which have not been tested yet. None of the excluded letters appear.

Guess 2: BLEED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) E(-) E(-) D(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From **CRANE**: C, R, A, N are not in the word (x). E is in the word but not at position 5 (-).
- From **BLEED**: B and D are not in the word (x). L, E, E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared (‑).  

So far we know:
- Excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, B, D**.
- Required letters (present somewhere): **E** (not in positions 3, 4, 5) and **L** (not in position 2).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep **E** in a different position (preferably position 2, which is allowed).
2. Include **L** but not at position 2.
3. Introduce new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

The word **YELLS** satisfies these conditions:
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- L appears at positions 3 and 4 (both not position 2).
- New letters **Y** and **S** are tried, and none of the letters are among the excluded set.

Thus the next guess will be **YELLS**.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, D, Y, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in positions 2‑5, so E must be at position 1.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2‑4, so L must be at position 5.

Thus the pattern is **E _ _ _ L**.

The remaining letters (positions 2‑4) must avoid the excluded letters and cannot be another E or L. Viable letters are: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

A common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **EXFIL** (E‑X‑F‑I‑L).

I'll guess that.

We have determined the secret word must fit the pattern:

- From previous feedback, letters C, R, A, N, B, D, Y, S, F, I are not in the word.
- E is present and cannot be in positions 2‑5, so it must be at position 1.
- L is present and cannot be in positions 2‑4, so it must be at position 5.
- X was guessed in position 2 and received a ✓, so X is at position 2.

Thus the word pattern is **E X _ _ L**.  
We need a valid English word matching this pattern using only letters not ruled out. The letters T and O are still possible, and the word **EXTOL** (E X T O L) fits perfectly.

Therefore the next guess is:
