We know the secret word starts with C and R in the first two positions. The letter A is not in the word, N is not in the word, and E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4. A good candidate that fits this pattern and uses common letters is **CREDO** (C R E D O), which places E in position 3 and introduces new letters D and O for further testing.

We have deduced the first four letters are C R E E based on feedback:
- C, R, E are correct in positions 1‑3.
- In the fourth guess, the second E (position 4) received ✓, confirming position 4 is E.
- Position 5 cannot be K (marked x) and also cannot be any letters previously marked x: A, N, D, O, S, T, K.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
