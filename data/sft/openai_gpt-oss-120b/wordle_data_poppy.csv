### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is O (confirmed).
- Position 5 is Y (confirmed).
- All other letters tried so far (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,F,L,D,S,J,B) are NOT in the word.
Thus the secret word looks like _ O _ _ Y, using only letters we haven’t ruled out: K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and possibly other letters not yet tried.

A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **POPPY** (P O P P Y). It introduces the new letter P while keeping O and Y in the known positions.
