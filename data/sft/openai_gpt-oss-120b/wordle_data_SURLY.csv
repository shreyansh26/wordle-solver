### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that contains a mix of common letters and vowels is “CRANE”. It gives information about C, R, A, N, and E, which will help narrow down the secret word after I receive feedback.

From the feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but NOT in the second position.

I need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Includes R in a position other than the second.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E.

A good candidate is **RUSTY**:
- R is in the first position (allowed).
- Contains no C, A, N, E.
- Uses new letters U, S, T, Y to gather more information.

Thus I will guess ""RUSTY"".

We have the following information:

- Position 5 is **Y** (correct).
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- The letter **S** is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters **C, A, N, E, T** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word matching the pattern _ U _ _ Y that contains both **R** and **S**, avoids the forbidden letters, and respects the position restrictions.

The word **SUR**LY fits:
- S is at position 1 (allowed, S not in position 3).
- U is at position 2 (✓).
- R is at position 3 (allowed, R not in positions 1 or 2).
- L is at position 4 (new letter, not excluded).
- Y is at position 5 (✓).

All constraints are satisfied, and “SUR**L**Y” is a valid English word.

Thus the next guess should be **SUR**LY.
