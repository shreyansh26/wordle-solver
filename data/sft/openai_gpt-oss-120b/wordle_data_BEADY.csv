### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess we know:
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- A is correct and in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word has the form __A__ with an E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4. I need a new word that respects these constraints and introduces fresh letters to test. “LEAKS” fits: L‑E‑A‑K‑S places A in position 3, puts E in position 2 (allowed), and adds the new letters L, K, and S for further testing.

- Letters **C, R, N, L, K, S** are not in the word (x).
- Letter **E** is not in position 5 (‑ from CRANE) but we already placed it at position 2.
Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ E A _ _** with the remaining unknown letters not being C,R,N,L,K,S.

A common English word that matches this pattern and uses only letters not yet ruled out is **HEAVY** (H‑E‑A‑V‑Y). It introduces three new letters (H, V, Y) for further testing.
