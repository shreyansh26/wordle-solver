### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but are in the wrong positions in CRANE.
  • A cannot be in position 3.
  • N cannot be in position 4.

We need a new guess that includes A and N (to keep testing them) while placing them in different positions, and avoids C, R, and E. Choosing a word that also introduces new letters will give us more information.

The word **ALIGN** satisfies these constraints:
- A is in position 1 (different from position 3).
- N is in position 5 (different from position 4).
- It contains no C, R, or E.
- Introduces new letters L, I, G for additional clues.

Thus, ALIGN is a good second guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, E are not in the word. A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (A not in position 3, N not in position 4).
- From ALIGN: L and G are not in the word. A, N, I are all in the word but each is in the wrong position (A not in positions 1 or 3, N not in positions 4 or 5, I not in position 3).

Thus the required letters are A, N, I, placed as:
- A can be only in positions 2, 4, 5.
- N can be only in positions 1, 2, 3.
- I can be only in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

We need a word that respects these constraints, avoids the excluded letters (C, R, E, L, G) and ideally introduces a new letter to learn more.  
The word **NINJA** fits perfectly:
- N at position 1 (allowed), I at 2 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed), J at 4 (new letter, not excluded), A at 5 (allowed).
- It contains the required A, N, I and adds J for fresh information.

Therefore, the next guess is:
