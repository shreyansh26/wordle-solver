# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word (marked with x): C, R, A, N, L, P, F, I, D.
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -): S, E, T.
- Letter E is correct in position 2 (✓).

Thus the secret word must contain **E** at position 2, and also contain **S** and **T**, with the following position restrictions:
- **S** cannot be in position 1 (it was – at position 1 in the guess “SLEPT”) and cannot be in position 2 (occupied by E). So S can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **T** cannot be in position 5 (it was – at position 5 in “CRANE”) and cannot be in position 3 (it was – at position 3 in “FETID”). Therefore T can be in positions 1 or 4.

All other letters must avoid the excluded set {C,R,A,N,L,P,F,I,D}. Remaining allowed letters include B, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A word that satisfies all constraints is **TESTY**:
- Pattern: T E S T Y
- E is correctly placed at position 2.
- S appears at position 3 (allowed).
- T appears at positions 1 and 4 (both allowed).
- Y is a permissible filler letter not excluded.

- Pattern: T E S T Y
- E is correctly placed at position 2.
- S appears at position 3 (allowed).
- T appears at positions 1 and 4 (both allowed).
- Y is a permissible filler letter not excluded.

- The first T in the word was marked “-”, meaning T is in the word but not in position 1; since T is correct at position 4, this is satisfied.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -): S, E, T.
- Letter E is correct in position 2 (✓).

Thus the secret word must contain **E** at position 2, and also contain **S** and **T**, with the following position restrictions:
- **S** cannot be in position 1 (it was – at position 1 in the guess “SLEPT”) and cannot be in position 2 (occupied by E). So S can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **T** cannot be in position 5 (it was – at position 5 in “CRANE”) and cannot be in position 3 (it was – at position 3 in “FETID”). Therefore T can be in positions 1 or 4.

All other letters must avoid the excluded set {C,R,A,N,L,P,F,I,D}. Remaining allowed letters include B, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
