### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- C is correct at position 3 (from VICED).
- E is in the word but not at positions 5 (first guess) nor 4 (second guess). So E can be at position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, V, I, D.
- Remaining positions must be filled with letters that are not excluded.

Choose a word with C at position 3 and E at position 2 (so pattern _ E C _ _). “PECKS” fits:
- P (allowed)
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- C at position 3 (confirmed)
- K and S are allowed and not previously excluded.
