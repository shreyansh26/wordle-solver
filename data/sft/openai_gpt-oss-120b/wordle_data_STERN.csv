### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- The secret word does **not** contain C, A, or G.
- It contains the letters **R**, **N**, and **E**.
- N is confirmed in position 5.
- E is confirmed in position 3, and there is at least one more E elsewhere (the second E in “GREEN” was marked “–”, meaning it is present but not in position 4).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- The extra E cannot be in position 4 (because the E guessed there was marked “–”).

Thus the pattern must be:

1 ? 2 ? 3 E 4 ? 5 N  
with a second E in position 1 or 2, and R in position 1 or 4.

A word that satisfies all of these is **SEERN** (S E E R N):
- E at positions 2 and 3,
- R at position 4 (not position 2),
- N at position 5,
- No forbidden letters.

So the next guess will be **SEERN**.
