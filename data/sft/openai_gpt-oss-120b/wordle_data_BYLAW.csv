### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels, to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it contains the frequently occurring letters C, R, N, and the vowels A and E.

- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll choose a new word that includes A and other fresh letters, while excluding the disallowed ones. “BALMY” fits: it has A (in position 2) and introduces B, L, M, Y, none of which have been ruled out.

We have:
- B is correct at position 1.
- L is correct at position 3.
- A is in the word but not at position 2 → A must be at 4 or 5.
- Y is in the word but not at position 5 → Y must be at 2 or 4.
Thus the pattern is B _ L _ _ with A and Y occupying the remaining spots, respecting the position rules.

A plausible word that fits these constraints is **BULAY**:
- B (✓) at 1
- U (new letter to test)
- L (✓) at 3
- A at 4 (A not at 2, allowed)
- Y at 5 (Y not at 5 in the secret, so this will give a “‑” hint, confirming Y is elsewhere)

This guess respects all known information and introduces a new letter (U) to gather more clues.
