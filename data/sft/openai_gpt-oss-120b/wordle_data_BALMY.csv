### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter A is present but not in the third position (since it was the third letter of CRANE). Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess I’ll choose a word that:
- Contains the letter A in a different position (not third).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, and E.
- Introduces several new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **ADMIT**: A is in position 1, and the other letters (D, M, I, T) are all new and not excluded.

- L is correct in position 3 (✓).
- S is not in the word (x).
- M is in the word but not in position 3 (from ADMIT). Since position 3 is already L, M must be in position 4 or 5.
- All other letters guessed as x are excluded: C, R, N, E, D, I, T, S.
