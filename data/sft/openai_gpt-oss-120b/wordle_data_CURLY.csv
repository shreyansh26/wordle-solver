### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct). The letter R is in the word but not in position 2, so R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5. Letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a common 5‑letter word that starts with C, contains an R somewhere other than the second slot, and avoids A, N, and E.

“CHIRP” fits:
- Starts with C.
- R is in position 4 (not position 2).
- Contains none of the excluded letters A, N, E.
Thus it satisfies all the known constraints and is a valid English word.
