### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

1. From CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. From ROVER:
- O and V are not in the word.
- Both R’s are in the word but each is in the wrong position (positions 1 and 5 are wrong for R).
- E is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains the letters R (twice) and E (once).
- Has no C, A, N, O, V.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 → possible positions for the two Rs are 3 and 4.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions for E are 1, 2, or 3. Since positions 3 and 4 are taken by the two Rs, E must be in position 1 or 2.

A common 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints is **BERRY**:
- Pattern: B E R R Y
- Contains two Rs at positions 3 and 4.
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters appear.

This fits all previous feedback, so it is a logical next guess.

We have the following feedback so far:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R is present but not in position 2; E is present but not in position 5.
- From ROVER: O and V are not in the word; both Rs are present but not in positions 1 or 5; E is present but not in position 4.
- From BERRY: B is present but not in position 1; E is correct in position 2; the first R is correct in position 3; the second R is present but not in position 4; Y is correct in position 5.

Putting these together:
- The secret word contains the letters B, E, R, R, Y.
- Known fixed positions: 2 = E, 3 = R, 5 = Y.
- The other R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 → it must be in position 1.
- B cannot be in position 1, so B must be in position 4.

This gives the pattern **R E R B Y**, which is not a common English word.  
To resolve the inconsistency we need a new guess that keeps the confirmed letters (E in 2, Y in 5) and tests the remaining uncertain positions while also checking whether B truly belongs in the word.

A good word that satisfies the known correct letters and uses only plausible letters is **RETRY**. It keeps R‑E‑‑‑Y, places an R in position 4 (testing if the second R belongs there) and introduces a new letter T to see if B is actually required.

Thus our next guess will be “RETRY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starter is **CRANE** because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E) in varied positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Excludes C, A, N.
- Contains R and E.
- Places R somewhere other than the 2nd slot.
- Places E somewhere other than the 5th slot.

A good candidate is **ROVER**:
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (both not position 2).
- E is in position 4 (not position 5).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus we will guess ""ROVER"".

<guess>ROVER</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROVER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) V(x) E(-) R(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

1. From CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. From ROVER:
- O and V are not in the word.
- Both R’s are in the word but each is in the wrong position (positions 1 and 5 are wrong for R).
- E is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains the letters R (twice) and E (once).
- Has no C, A, N, O, V.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 → possible positions for the two Rs are 3 and 4.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions for E are 1, 2, or 3. Since positions 3 and 4 are taken by the two Rs, E must be in position 1 or 2.

A common 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints is **BERRY**:
- Pattern: B E R R Y
- Contains two Rs at positions 3 and 4.
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters appear.

This fits all previous feedback, so it is a logical next guess.

<guess>BERRY</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROVER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) V(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: BERRY -> FEEDBACK: B(-) E(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback so far:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R is present but not in position 2; E is present but not in position 5.
- From ROVER: O and V are not in the word; both Rs are present but not in positions 1 or 5; E is present but not in position 4.
- From BERRY: B is present but not in position 1; E is correct in position 2; the first R is correct in position 3; the second R is present but not in position 4; Y is correct in position 5.

Putting these together:
- The secret word contains the letters B, E, R, R, Y.
- Known fixed positions: 2 = E, 3 = R, 5 = Y.
- The other R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 → it must be in position 1.
- B cannot be in position 1, so B must be in position 4.

This gives the pattern **R E R B Y**, which is not a common English word.  
To resolve the inconsistency we need a new guess that keeps the confirmed letters (E in 2, Y in 5) and tests the remaining uncertain positions while also checking whether B truly belongs in the word.

A good word that satisfies the known correct letters and uses only plausible letters is **RETRY**. It keeps R‑E‑‑‑Y, places an R in position 4 (testing if the second R belongs there) and introduces a new letter T to see if B is actually required.

Thus our next guess will be “RETRY”.

We have gathered the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Letters confirmed in the word: **R**, **E**, **Y**, **B**.
- Positions confirmed: 
  * Position 2 = **E** (from BERRY and RETRY)
  * Position 3 = **R** (from BERRY)
  * Position 5 = **Y** (from BERRY and RETRY)
- Letter **B** is in the word but not at position 1 (B‑feedback from BERRY). The only free slot left for B is position 4, so position 4 = **B**.
- The remaining slot, position 1, must be a letter not yet ruled out (C, A, N, O, V, T are eliminated). 

The pattern therefore is **_ E R B Y**.  
The common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **DERBY**.

Thus the next logical guess is “DERBY”.
