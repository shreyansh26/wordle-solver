### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:
- R is correct in position 1.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so it must be in position 4 or 5.
- E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters C, N, T, S are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **R _ _ _ _** with:
- E at position 2 or 3,
- A at position 4 or 5,
- the remaining two spots filled by letters not yet ruled out.

Choosing a common word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters, I select **REGAL** (R E G A L):
- R is fixed at position 1,
- E is placed at position 2 (allowed),
- A is placed at position 4 (allowed),
- G and L are new letters to test.

This guess complies with all known feedback.
