### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common, well-distributed 5‑letter word to get useful feedback. 
A good starter is “CRANE” because it contains common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N). 
I'll use that as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but NOT in the first position.
- R, A, N, and E are NOT in the word at all.

Thus the secret word must contain a C somewhere in positions 2‑5, and cannot contain R, A, N, or E. I need a common 5‑letter word fitting those constraints. “SCOUT” places C in the second slot and uses only letters S, O, U, T besides C, none of which are excluded. It’s a valid guess.

From previous guesses:
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so C can be 4 or 5.
- O is correct at position 3.
- Letters R, A, N, E, S, U, T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ O _ _. With C at position 4 or 5 and avoiding the eliminated letters. “BLOCK” (B L O C K) fits: O is third, C is fourth, and none of its letters have been ruled out.
