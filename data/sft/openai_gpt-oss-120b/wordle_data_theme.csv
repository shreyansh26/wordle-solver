### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters. “CRANE” includes two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), which should give useful information about the secret word’s letters and their positions.

We have the following confirmed information from previous feedback:

- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: unknown (Y was marked x, so Y is not the third letter)
- Position 4: M (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **T H _ M E**.  
The only common English word that matches this pattern is **THEME**, which places an E in the third position. This also introduces a repeated letter (E) that we have not yet tested in the third slot, and it does not use any letters previously marked as absent.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""THEME"".
