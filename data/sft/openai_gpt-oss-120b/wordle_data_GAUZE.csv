### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting guess because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). This should give me a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (‑). So A can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Letters S, L, T are not in the word (x).

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, includes A in positions 1, 2, or 4, and excludes S, L, T.

Choose a common word that fits these constraints and introduces new letters to test. “CARVE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- Places A in position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces C, R, V which are still unknown.
- Avoids S, L, T.

This guess will give us more information about the remaining letters.

We have the pattern based on feedback:
- Position 2 = A (✓).
- Position 5 = E (✓).
- Letters S, L, T, C, R, V are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like _ A _ _ E with remaining possible letters.

We need a valid 5‑letter word that fits this pattern and avoids the excluded letters while introducing new letters to narrow possibilities. “GAUZE” fits:
- G A U Z E matches _ A _ _ E.
- G, U, Z have not been tried yet.
- None of the letters are among the excluded set.

Thus GAUZE is a good next guess.
