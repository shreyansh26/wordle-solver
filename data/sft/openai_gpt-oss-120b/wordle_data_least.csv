### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, balanced 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” includes two frequently used consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should give me useful information about the secret word’s letters and their positions.

We know:
- The secret word is 5 letters.
- From the first guess CRANE we got:
  - C is not in the word.
  - R is not in the word.
  - A is correct and in the correct spot (position 3).
  - N is not in the word.
  - E is in the word but in the wrong spot, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 5).
We need a new word that respects these constraints:
- Position 3 must be A.
- Must contain an E, placed somewhere other than position 5.
- Must avoid C, R, N.
A good candidate is **LEAST**:
  - L (new), E (position 2, satisfying the “wrong spot” rule), A (position 3 correct), S (new), T (new).
All constraints are satisfied, so we’ll guess LEAST.
