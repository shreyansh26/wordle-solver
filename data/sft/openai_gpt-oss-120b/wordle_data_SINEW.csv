### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A at any position. It does contain N and E, but N is NOT in position 4 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”) and E is NOT in position 5. We need a new five‑letter word that includes N and E in different spots, avoids C, R, A, and tries new letters to gather information.

A good candidate is **ENJOY**:
- E is in position 1 (different from position 5 in CRANE, allowed).
- N is in position 2 (different from position 4, allowed).
- The remaining letters J, O, Y are new, giving us fresh clues.
Thus ENJOY satisfies all constraints and will give useful feedback.

- I is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.
- S is in the word but not at position 5, so S must be at position 1.

Thus the word pattern is **S I N E _**.  
The only remaining unknown letter is the fifth one. It must be a letter we haven’t ruled out (C, R, A, J, O, Y, V are out). A common English word that fits this pattern is **SINEW** (with W as the final letter). This introduces a new letter (W) and satisfies all known constraints.
