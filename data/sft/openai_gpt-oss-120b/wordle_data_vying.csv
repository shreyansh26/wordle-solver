### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that positions 3‑5 are fixed as I‑N‑G based on feedback. Eliminated letters (marked x) are C, R, A, E, S, L, T, H, D, O. Remaining possible letters for the first two positions include B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

A valid English word matching the pattern __ING with allowed letters is **VYING** (V‑Y‑I‑N‑G). Both V and Y have not been eliminated, and the word is common enough.

Thus we will guess ""VYING"".
