### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and covers a range of vowel and consonant positions. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the common vowel “A” and frequent consonants “C”, “R”, “N”, and “E”.

Letter A and N are not in the word at all.  
E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

- E is in the word but not at positions 3 (from guess2) or 5 (from guess1); thus E must be at position 4.
