### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word with a mix of common letters to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter.

We know the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, or E anywhere. We need a new 5‑letter word fitting that pattern. “CLOUD” satisfies: it starts with C and includes L, O, U, D, none of which have been ruled out. This guess will test several common letters.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct). From the second guess CLOUD, we learned:
- L is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- U and D are not in the word.
So the word pattern is: C _ _ _ _. O must be in position 2, 4, or 5. All other letters must avoid R, A, N, E, L, U, D.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **COMFY**:
- Starts with C.
- Contains O in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses letters M, F, Y which have not been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters appear.
Thus “COMFY” is a valid next guess.
