### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1: E (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- E is not in positions 2,3,5 (all marked -), so E must be at position 1 only.
- Letters excluded (x): C, R, A, P, Y, B, L, D, X, O, S.
- Remaining possible letters for unknown positions: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, Z, plus N (could appear again, but not yet tested elsewhere).

We need a word pattern **E _ _ N _** using only allowed letters. A common English word fitting this pattern and the allowed letters is **EKING** (E‑K‑I‑N‑G). All letters K, I, G are not excluded, and the word satisfies the known placements.

Thus the next guess is:
