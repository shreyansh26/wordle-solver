### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E). This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the feedback that:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tests new letters.  
“RIVET” places R at position 1 (good, not 2) and E at position 4 (good, not 5), and introduces I, V, T for further information.

Thus “RIVET” is a valid next guess.

We have the following information:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, I.
- E is in the word and is correctly placed at position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 → R must be at position 3 or 5.
- V is in the word but not in position 3 → V can be at 1, 2, or 5.
- T is in the word but not in position 5 → T can be at 1, 2, or 3.

Thus the word must contain the letters **E, R, V, T** plus one other unknown letter (not C, A, N, I).  
A word that satisfies all positional constraints is **VOTER**:

- Position 1 = V (allowed, V not in position 3)
- Position 2 = O (new letter, not excluded)
- Position 3 = T (allowed, T not in position 5)
- Position 4 = E (confirmed)
- Position 5 = R (allowed, R not in positions 1 or 2)

All constraints are met, so VOTER is a valid next guess.
