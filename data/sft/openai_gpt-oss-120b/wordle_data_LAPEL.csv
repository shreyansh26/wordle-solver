### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (A not 3rd, E not 5th).

So the secret word must contain A and E, avoid C, R, N, and place A somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Choose a word that meets these constraints and adds new letters to test. “VALET” (V A L E T) satisfies:
- Contains A (in position 2) and E (in position 4), both different from the disallowed spots.
- No C, R, or N.
- Introduces new letters V, L, T for further clues.

Thus the next guess is VALET.

We know the secret word pattern is _ A _ E _. From the feedback:
- A is correct at position 2.
- E is correct at position 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (it got a “-” on the third spot in VALET). So L must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters C, R, N, V, T are ruled out.
We need a word that fits the pattern, uses L in position 1 or 5, and avoids the forbidden letters. Two strong candidates are **LABEL** (L A B E L) and **LAPEL** (L A P E L). Both satisfy all known constraints and introduce a new letter (B or P) to get more information. I will guess **LAPEL** to test the new letter P and confirm the placement of L.
