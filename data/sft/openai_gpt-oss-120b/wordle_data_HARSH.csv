### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, N, E are not in the word (x). R is in the word but in the wrong spot (-), A is in the word but wrong spot (-).

Thus:
- Fixed letter: position 2 = A.
- R must be somewhere in positions 3‑5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, D, I, O.

- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain R and A, placed elsewhere. I’ll choose a word that puts R and A in new positions and avoids the excluded letters. “RADIO” places R at position 1 and A at position 2, both valid, and introduces new letters D, I, O for further clues.

Thus:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

- Position 5 = H (from AARGH).

Feedback indicates:
- S is in the word but not at position 5 (from PARAS where S got “-”).
- G is not in the word (from AARGH).
- All other letters tried (C, N, E, D, I, O, L, V, P, S already accounted, G) are excluded.

Thus the pattern is **_ A R _ H** with S somewhere in the remaining slots. Placing S at position 4 yields the common word **MARSH** (M A R S H), which fits all known constraints and introduces only a new letter M that hasn’t been ruled out.

So the next guess should be “MARSH”.",Guess 6: MARSH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓) H(✓),FAIL
