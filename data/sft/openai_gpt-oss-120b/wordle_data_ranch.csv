### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter word. A common starter that covers a mix of common letters is “CRANE”. It uses two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), which should give useful feedback for the next steps.

The feedback from the first guess tells me that the letters C, R, A, and N are all in the secret word but each is in a different position than they were in ""CRANE"". The letter E is not in the word at all. 

I need a new five‑letter word that includes C, R, A, and N, but places each of them in positions other than 1‑4 respectively. A valid word that satisfies this is **RANCY**:
- R moves to position 1 (was position 2 before)
- A moves to position 2 (was position 3)
- N moves to position 3 (was position 4)
- C moves to position 4 (was position 1)
- Y is a new letter to test.

This respects all the previous feedback.

We have determined the first four letters are R A N C based on the second guess feedback (all four are correct and in the correct spots). The fifth letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated. E and Y are ruled out; other letters are still possible. The common English word that fits the pattern R A N C _ is ""RANCH"". This uses H, which hasn't been ruled out, and forms a valid English word.
