### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E. This will give me information about both consonants and vowels for the secret word.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all, while the letter E is present but not in position 5. Therefore the next guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

A good candidate is **BLEED**: it contains two E’s (providing the required E not at the end) and uses only letters B, L, D that we have not yet ruled out.
