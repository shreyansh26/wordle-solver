### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- L is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.
- A is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). Therefore A can only be at position 1 or 5.
- Letters C, R, N, P, D are not in the word.

Pattern so far: _ _ L E _.  
If A is at position 1, the pattern becomes A _ L E _. A common 5‑letter word fitting this is **AXLES** (A‑X‑L‑E‑S). This uses only new letters X and S, which haven’t been ruled out yet, and satisfies all known constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

We have confirmed the fixed letters:

- Position 3: L
- Position 4: E

Pattern: A _ L E _.  
All letters marked “x” (C, R, N, P, D, X, S, G, T) are not in the word.  
We still need to determine the letters for positions 2 and 5. To gather information, we can guess a word that follows the pattern and introduces a new candidate for the fifth position while reusing a known‑excluded letter in a place we already know is wrong (that's acceptable, it just confirms the exclusion). “AGLEY” fits the pattern A ? L E ? and will test Y for the final slot.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- Letters C, R, N, P, D are not in the word.

Pattern so far: _ _ L E _.  
If A is at position 1, the pattern becomes A _ L E _. A common 5‑letter word fitting this is **AXLES** (A‑X‑L‑E‑S). This uses only new letters X and S, which haven’t been ruled out yet, and satisfies all known constraints.

Thus the word pattern is **A _ L E _**.

Letters ruled out: C, R, N, P, D, X, S (all received “x”).  
Remaining unknown letters for positions 2 and 5 must be chosen from the alphabet excluding those ruled‑out letters and any already placed letters.

A valid English word matching **A _ L E _** and using only unused letters is **AGLET** (a small metal tip on a shoelace).  
This introduces new letters G and T, which have not been eliminated, and satisfies the known pattern.
