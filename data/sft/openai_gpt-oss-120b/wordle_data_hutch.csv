2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

The feedback indicates:
- Position 2 is U (✓).
- Position 3 is T (✓).
- Position 4 is C (✓).
- Position 5 is H (✓).
- Position 1 is not B (B got x).

So the pattern is _ U T C H. A valid English word fitting this pattern is **HUTCH** (H‑U‑T‑C‑H). The first letter H hasn't been ruled out, and duplication of H is allowed since H is confirmed present.
