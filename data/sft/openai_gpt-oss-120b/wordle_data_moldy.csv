### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start the game I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and a couple of vowels. “CRANE” is a popular starter word in Wordle‑style games because it covers the letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving a good chance of hitting some correct letters or positions on the first try.

We have:
- Y is correct at position 5 (✓).

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, plus any repeats of those.
We need a 5‑letter word ending with Y, containing L and M in allowed positions, and using only letters not excluded.

Word “MULKY” fits:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains M (position 1) – allowed (not position 4).
- Contains L (position 3) – allowed (not position 2).
- Uses U and K, which are not excluded.
Thus it satisfies all constraints.
