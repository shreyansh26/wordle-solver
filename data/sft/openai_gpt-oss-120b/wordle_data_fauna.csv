### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct in the 4th position.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ N _. It must contain an A somewhere other than the 3rd slot (so A can be 1st, 2nd, or 5th). We also must avoid using C, R, and E in the next guess.

A common word that fits these constraints is **ALONG**:
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- N is in position 4 (matches the known correct spot).
- No C, R, or E are used.
Thus “ALONG” is a valid next guess.

- Position 4 is N (from all guesses: N(✓)).
- Letters C, R, E, L, O, G, T, I are not in the word.
- Letters A and N are the only confirmed letters; no other letters are known to be present.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ A _ N _.

We need a valid English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.  
Possible candidates include:
- FAWNS (F A W N S)
- YAWNS (Y A W N S)
- BAWNS (B A W N S)

All three fit the pattern, avoid the excluded letters, and are common enough to be acceptable guesses. I will choose **FAWNS** as the next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 1: **F** (green)
- Position 2: **A** (green)
- Position 4: **N** (green)

From guess 5 (FANNY):
- The letter **N** at position 3 got a “‑”, meaning the word contains an N elsewhere (we already have the N at position 4), so position 3 cannot be N.
- The letter **Y** at position 5 is not in the word.

Excluded letters (all marked “x” in previous feedback): C, R, E, L, O, G, T, I, W, S, Y.

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern **F A _ N _**, using only letters that are not excluded.  
A common English word that matches this pattern is **FAUNA** (F A U N A).  
- F A are already confirmed.  
- U is not among the excluded letters.  
- N is already green at position 4.  
- A at position 5 does not conflict with any prior feedback (A was only known to be not in position 1 or 3).
