### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start the Wordle-like game with a valid 5‑letter word. A good opening guess that contains a mix of common letters and vowels is “SLATE”. It includes three common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), giving the game useful information for the next steps.

We have feedback: L is correct at position 2, S is in the word but not position 1. Letters A, T, E are not in the word. So the secret word pattern is _ L _ _ _. It must contain S somewhere other than position 1. It cannot contain A, T, or E. A good candidate that fits these constraints is “BLUSH” (B L U S H): L is at position 2, S is at position 4, and it uses none of the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - L is correct at position 2.
   - S is in the word but not at position 1.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. BLUSH → B(✓) L(✓) U(x) S(✓) H(x)
   - B is correct at position 1.
   - L is correct at position 2 (confirms previous).
   - S is correct at position 4.
   - U and H are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
1 B, 2 L, 3 ?, 4 S, 5 ?

Letters that cannot appear: A, T, E, U, H.  
Letters already placed: B, L, S.  

We need a common English word matching B L _ S _. Looking at possibilities, “BLISS” fits:
- B L I S S → positions 1 B, 2 L, 3 I, 4 S, 5 S.
All letters are allowable (I is not excluded), and the repeat of S at position 5 is possible.

Therefore the next guess should be “BLISS”.
