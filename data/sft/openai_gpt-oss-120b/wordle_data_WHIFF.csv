### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified the confirmed letters from feedback:

- H is correct at position 2 (✓)
- I is correct at position 3 (✓)

Letters excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, G, T, P, S, and also any letters that received an ‘x’ in previous guesses.

We need a valid English word that starts with **WHI** and uses two new letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z). 

A common word fitting this pattern is **WHIFF** (W H I F F), where the new letter F has not been tested yet. This guess will tell us whether F is the correct fourth and fifth letters.

Thus the next guess is:
