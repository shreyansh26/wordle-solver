### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1: A (✓ from ARROW)
- Position 2: R (✓ from CRANE and ARROW)
- Position 4: O (✓ from ARROW)
- Position 5: R (✓ from ARROW and ARBOR, also the “-” on the third R in ARROW indicates the second R is not in position 3, so it must be position 5)

Thus the pattern is **A R _ O R**.

Letters known to be absent from the word: C, N, E, W, B, M (all marked x).  
The third letter cannot be R (we already have the two Rs) and cannot be any of the excluded letters.

A common English word fitting A R _ O R with a new letter in the third spot is **ARDOR** (meaning passion). The third letter D has not been tried and is not excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be ARDOR.
