### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the letters S, L, and A are in the secret word but are not in the positions they occupied in the guess “SLATE”: S cannot be in position 1, L cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3. The letters T and E are not in the word at all. 

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes S, L, and A (each at a different position from those prohibited) and does not contain T or E. A word that satisfies these constraints is **NASAL**:
- N (1) – a new letter, allowed.
- A (2) – A is present and not in position 3, so this is valid.
- S (3) – S is present and not in position 1, so this is valid.
- A (4) – duplicate A is permissible; still not in the forbidden position.
- L (5) – L is present and not in position 2, so this is valid.
No letters T or E appear.

Thus “NASAL” is a consistent next guess.

We have determined from feedback:
- Position 2 = A (correct)
- Position 3 = S (correct)
- Position 5 = L (correct)
- Letters not in the word: T, E, N.
- Position 1 and 4 are still unknown, and cannot be A (position4 cannot be A because A at pos4 got a '-' indicating wrong spot).
We need a valid 5‑letter word of the form _ A S _ L, using only letters not excluded. “BASIL” fits: B A S I L, giving new letters B and I for positions 1 and 4, respecting all constraints.
