### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- Letters **R** and **A** are both in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in the previous guesses:
  * R is not in position 1 (RAISE) nor position 2 (CRANE); therefore R can be in position 3 or 4.
  * A is not in position 2 (RAISE) nor position 3 (CRANE); therefore A can be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters **C, N, I, S** are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with **E** that includes both A and R in allowed spots and does not contain any excluded letters.  
One such word is **ADORE**:

- D and O are new letters we have not tested yet.
