2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placement. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and the common vowel A, giving useful information for the next steps.

The feedback tells us:
- N is correct at position 4.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- C, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word with N in the fourth slot, R somewhere other than the second slot, and without C, A, or E.

A suitable word is **BURNT**:
- B U R N T → N is in position 4.
- R is in position 3 (not position 2).
- No C, A, or E appear.
Thus it fits all the constraints.

We have the constraints:

- U is in the word but not at position 2, so it can be at 1, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, A, E, B, T.

Looking for a word with pattern ? ? ? N ?, containing both R and U, respecting the allowed positions.

The word **ROUND** fits:
- R at position 1 (allowed).
- U at position 3 (allowed, not position 2).
- N at position 4 (confirmed).
- The remaining letters O and D are not excluded.

Thus ROUND is a valid next guess.
