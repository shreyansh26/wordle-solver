### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain C and A, placed somewhere other than those prohibited spots, and must avoid R, N, E.  
I’ll pick a word that includes C and A in new positions and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “PATCH” fits:  
- C is in position 4 (allowed).  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- It contains none of R, N, or E.  

Thus “PATCH” is a good second guess.

We have:
- From CRANE: C in word not position1, A in word not position3, R,N,E not in word.
- From PATCH: P not, A not position2 (and still not position3), T correct at position3, C not position4, H not.
Thus:
- T fixed at position3.
- A present, positions allowed: 1,4,5 (not 2,3).
- C present, positions allowed: 2 or5 (not 1,4).
- Remaining letters cannot be R,N,E,P,H.
Choosing the word “ATTIC” gives:
1 A (allowed), 2 T (extra T, allowed), 3 T (✓), 4 I (new letter, not excluded), 5 C (allowed). It satisfies all constraints.
