### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll pick a common five‑letter word using only letters not eliminated. “GHOST” uses G, H, O, S, T – all still possible – and includes a mix of consonants and a vowel to give useful new information.

We need a five‑letter word with O at the third spot, containing S and T in allowed positions, and introducing new letters to test.

We have discovered that the first four letters are S, T, O, O (all correct). The fifth letter cannot be K (feedback x) and must be a letter not previously eliminated (C,R,A,N,E,G,H,M,P,K). The common English word matching the pattern STOO_ is ""STOOL"", where the last letter is L, which hasn't been ruled out. This should solve the puzzle.
