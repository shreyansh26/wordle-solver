### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information. “CRANE” is a frequently used starting word in Wordle-like games because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

We know the secret word contains the letters C, A, and L, each in a different position from where they appeared in the previous guesses.  
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- L cannot be in position 1.  

We also know that R, N, E, K, and S are not in the word.  
To gather more information, we should make a guess that:
* Still includes C, A, and L (so we can test their positions),  
* Places them in positions we haven’t tried yet, and  
* Introduces two new letters to learn about the remaining slots.

A good word that meets these criteria is **CLAMP**:
- C is in position 1 (known to be wrong, but will confirm it’s still “‑”),  
- L is in position 2 (a new possible correct spot),  
- A is in position 3 (known to be wrong, confirming it’s still “‑”),  
- M and P are new letters to test the other two positions.

This guess respects all known exclusions and will give us fresh feedback on L’s position and the new letters.

A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information. “CRANE” is a frequently used starting word in Wordle-like games because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new guess that includes C and A in different positions, avoids R, N, E, and tests new letters. “LACKS” satisfies these conditions:
- C is at position 3 (different from position 1).
- A is at position 2 (different from position 3).
- No R, N, or E appear.
It also introduces L, K, and S for further clues.

Guess 2: LACKS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) C(-) K(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know the secret word contains the letters C, A, and L, each in a different position from where they appeared in the previous guesses.  
- C cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- L cannot be in position 1.  

We also know that R, N, E, K, and S are not in the word.  
To gather more information, we should make a guess that:
* Still includes C, A, and L (so we can test their positions),  
* Places them in positions we haven’t tried yet, and  
* Introduces two new letters to learn about the remaining slots.

A good word that meets these criteria is **CLAMP**:
- C is in position 1 (known to be wrong, but will confirm it’s still “‑”),  
- L is in position 2 (a new possible correct spot),  
- A is in position 3 (known to be wrong, confirming it’s still “‑”),  
- M and P are new letters to test the other two positions.

This guess respects all known exclusions and will give us fresh feedback on L’s position and the new letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LACKS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) C(-) K(x) S(x)
Guess 3: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(-) L(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from the feedback:

- Letters in the word: C, A, L (each marked “-” meaning present but in a different position).
- Letters not in the word: R, N, E, K, S, M, P.
- Position restrictions:
  * C cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions 2, 4, 5.
  * A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5.
  * L cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3, 4, 5.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing C, A, and L, respecting these position limits, and using only letters that haven’t been excluded.

The word **AULIC** fits perfectly:
- A is in position 1 (allowed for A).
- U (new letter) is in position 2.
- L is in position 3 (allowed for L).
- I (new letter) is in position 4.
- C is in position 5 (allowed for C).

All constraints are satisfied, and it introduces two new letters (U and I) for further information.

Thus the next guess should be **AULIC**.

We have determined that the only confirmed letters are A, C, and L, each marked “-” meaning they are in the word but not in the positions we have tried.

From all feedback:
- C cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 → possible positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.

The only way to satisfy all three simultaneously is:
- C in position 2,
- A and L occupying positions 4 and 5 (order unknown).

That leaves positions 1 and 3 for two letters we have not yet tried (they cannot be any of the excluded letters R, N, E, K, S, M, P, U, I).

A common English word that fits the pattern **_ C _ A L** (or **_ C _ L A**) and uses only new letters in the remaining spots is **OCTAL**:
- O (new) at position 1,
- C at position 2 (allowed),
- T (new) at position 3,
- A at position 4 (allowed for A),
- L at position 5 (allowed for L).

All constraints are satisfied and the word introduces two fresh letters (O and T) for further information.
