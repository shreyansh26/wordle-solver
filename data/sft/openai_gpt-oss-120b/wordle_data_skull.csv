### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE had all letters marked x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters. Choosing a word with common letters that aren’t excluded will give useful information. “GHOST” uses G, H, O, S, T, all of which are permissible and includes a mix of consonants and a vowel.

We have feedback:
- CRANE: C,R,A,N,E all not in the word.
- GHOST: G,H,O,T not in the word; S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4 in GHOST).

Thus the secret word must contain S, not at position 4, and cannot contain any of the letters {C,R,A,N,E,G,H,O,T}. Remaining possible letters are {B,D,F,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

We need a common 5‑letter word using S plus four of those allowed letters, with S not in the 4th slot. ""SKILL"" fits: letters S, K, I, L, L are all allowed, S is at position 1, satisfying the position constraint.
