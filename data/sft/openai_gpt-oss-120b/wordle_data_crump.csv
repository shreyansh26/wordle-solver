### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first two letters are C and R in the correct spots. The letters A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all, so the remaining three positions must avoid those letters. A common word fitting the pattern C R _ _ _ and using none of the excluded letters is “CROWD”. It uses O, W, D which are still possible. I’ll guess that.

We know the first two letters are C and R in the correct positions. The letters A, N, E, O, W, D are not in the word. Therefore the secret word matches the pattern C R _ _ _. We need a valid word fitting that pattern without using any excluded letters.

Possible candidates include CRISP (I, S, P), CRUMB (U, M, B), CRIMP (I, M, P), etc. To maximize new information, I’ll guess a word that tests three fresh common letters. “CRIMP” introduces I, M, and P, none of which have been tested yet.
