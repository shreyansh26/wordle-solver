### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. 
A good opening guess is “CRANE”, which includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E. This should give me a solid base of feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word ends with E (E is correct in position 5). The letter R is in the word but not in position 2. Letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all. To get more information, we should choose a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R in a position other than 2.
- Introduces new letters while avoiding C, A, N.
A good candidate is **ROUSE** (R O U S E): R is at position 1, satisfying the “R not in position 2” condition, and O, U, S are new letters to test.

We have the following information:

- Secret word ends with **E** (position 5 confirmed).
- Letters **R**, **O**, **S** are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses:
  * R is NOT in positions 1 or 2.
  * O is NOT in position 2.
  * S is NOT in position 4.
- Letters **C**, **A**, **N**, **U** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E that contains R, O, S in positions respecting those restrictions, and introduces a new letter to test other possibilities.

The word **SPORE** fits perfectly:
- Pattern: S (pos1), P (pos2), O (pos3), R (pos4), E (pos5).
- R is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed).
- It adds the new letter **P** for further testing.

Thus the next guess should be SPORE.
