### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- The letter **C** is in the word but not in position 1.
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word at all.
- **E** is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word must end with **E**, contain a **C** somewhere in positions 2‑4, and avoid R, A, N.  
A common five‑letter word fitting these constraints is **SLICE** (S L I C E): C is in position 4 (not first) and the word ends with E, with none of the forbidden letters.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: C (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)
- Position 2 is unknown, but cannot be any letters that were marked x: R, A, N, L. It also cannot be C (already used) or other already placed letters. The most common word fitting S?ICE is ""SPICE"", with P in position 2, which hasn't been ruled out. So we guess SPICE.
