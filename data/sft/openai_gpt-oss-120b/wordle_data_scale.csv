I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess should contain common letters in various positions to give useful feedback. ""SLATE"" includes S, L, A, T, E – a mix of frequent consonants and vowels, and spreads them across the word. This will help identify which letters are in the secret word and some of their positions.

From the feedback:
- S is correct at position 1.
- L is in the word but not at position 2, so it must be at position 4 (the only remaining slot).
- A is correct at position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 5.

Thus the pattern is S _ A L E. The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""SCALE"". I’ll guess that.
