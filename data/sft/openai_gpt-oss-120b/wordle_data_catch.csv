### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback from first guess:
- C is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore the secret word looks like: C _ _ _ _.  
It must contain an A somewhere other than the third slot (positions 2, 4, or 5) and must avoid the letters R, N, E.  

I will choose a word that keeps C in the first position, places A in a new position (position 2), and introduces three fresh letters that have not been tested yet, while also respecting the forbidden letters.  

The word **CAULK** fits these constraints:
- C is first (keeps the known correct letter).
- A is second (a new possible position for A).
- Uses U, L, K – all letters not yet ruled out.
- Contains no R, N, or E.

Thus the next guess will be “CAULK”.
