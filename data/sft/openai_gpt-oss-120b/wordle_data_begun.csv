### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A good starting word should contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the two most common vowels (A, E). I'll use that as my first guess.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain both N and E, placed in other positions. I’ll choose a guess that includes N and E in new spots and avoids C, R, A. “MENDS” (M‑E‑N‑D‑S) puts E at position 2 and N at position 3, satisfying the constraints while testing new letters M, D, and S.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  → C, R, A are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4. E is in the word but not in position 5.

- Guess 2 (MENDS): M(x), E(✓), N(-), D(x), S(x)  
  → M, D, S are not in the word. E is correctly placed at position 2. N is in the word but not in position 3.

Combining the clues:
- Position 2 is **E** (fixed).
- N must be somewhere else, but not positions 3, 4, 5 → possible positions are 1 or 5.
- Letters ruled out completely: C, R, A, M, D, S.
- Remaining unknown letters for the other spots can be any unused letters.

A common English word fitting the pattern **_ E _ _ N** (with N at the end) and not using any forbidden letters is **BEGUN** (B E G U N).

Thus the next logical guess is “BEGUN”.
