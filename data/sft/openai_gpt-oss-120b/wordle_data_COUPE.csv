### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to give me information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “ARISE” is a good starter for this purpose.

The feedback tells us only the last letter E is correct and in the correct position. The letters A, R, I, and S are not in the secret word at all. I need a new five‑letter word that ends with E and does not contain any of those excluded letters. “CLONE” fits: C L O N are new letters, and it ends with E. This will test four new letters while keeping the known correct E in place.

We have identified that the secret word starts with C and ends with E. The letters A,R,I,S,L,N are definitely not in the word. O is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore O must be in position 2 or 4. A suitable 5‑letter word that matches the pattern C ? ? ? E and places O in position 2 is **COUPE** (C‑O‑U‑P‑E). This guess will test O in a valid spot and introduce two new letters U and P.
