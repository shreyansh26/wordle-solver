### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that covers a mix of common letters and vowel positions is “CRANE”. This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word pattern from feedback: position 2 is R, position 4 is N, and letters C, A, E are not in the word at all. So the word looks like _ R _ N _. Valid candidates include BRING, GRIND, FRONT, etc. I’ll choose ""GRIND"" to test new letters I and D while fitting the pattern.

From the feedback:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 4 is N (correct).
- Letters C, A, E, I, D are not in the word.
- G is in the word but not in position 1, so G must be in position 3 or 5.

Possible patterns:
1. _ R G N _
2. _ R _ N G

A common word fitting pattern 2 is **PRONG** (P R O N G). It introduces new letters P and O while placing G at the correct possible spot (position 5). This will confirm whether O and/or P are in the secret word and also verify G’s position.

Thus the next guess should be PRONG.
