### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- All letters in ""SLATE"" are not in the secret word.
- In ""CRONY"": C is correct and in the right spot (position 1). R, N, Y are not in the word. O is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word starts with C, contains O somewhere other than the third position, and cannot contain S, L, A, T, E, R, N, Y.  
A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **COMIC** (C O M I C): C is first, O is second (not third), and the remaining letters M, I, C are all allowed.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)
- Position 5: H (✓)

Position 4 is still unknown. The dash on the second C in “COUCH” only tells us that C is not in position 4 (which we already know because C is at position 1). No other letters have been ruled out for position 4 except that it cannot be C.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **C O U _ H**. A common English word matching this pattern is **COUGH** (with G in the fourth position). All letters are allowed (none have been marked as absent).

The next logical guess is therefore “COUGH”.
