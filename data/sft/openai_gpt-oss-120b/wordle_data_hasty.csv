### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that:
- T is correct in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has pattern ___T_ with letters S and A somewhere else (not in their previous spots). A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **PASTY**:
- P A S T Y
- A is now in position 2 (allowed).
- S is now in position 3 (allowed).
- T remains in position 4 (confirmed).
- No L or E are present.

Thus we will guess “PASTY”.

We have the following feedback:

Thus the secret word pattern is **_ A S T Y**, with the first letter still unknown but it cannot be P, L, or E (and obviously not A, S, T, Y). The common English words fitting “_ASTY” are **NASTY**, **HASTY**, **MASTY**, etc. “NASTY” and “HASTY” are the most common, and both satisfy the known constraints. I will try “NASTY” first.
