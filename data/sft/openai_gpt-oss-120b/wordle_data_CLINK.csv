I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I'll pick a common word that covers a variety of common letters to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E.

From the first guess we have:
- C is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 4.
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is C _ _ N _. The remaining letters must avoid R, A, E and also avoid using C or N again unless the word actually repeats them. A good candidate that fits this pattern is **CLINK** (C‑L‑I‑N‑K), which uses only allowed letters and is a common English word.
