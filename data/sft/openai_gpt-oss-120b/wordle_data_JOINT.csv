### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word must have:
- N in the 4th position (from CRANE and MOUND).
- O in the 2nd position (from MOUND).
- No letters C, R, A, E, M, U, D (all shown as “x”).

So the pattern is _ O _ N _. We need a valid 5‑letter word that fits this pattern, avoids the prohibited letters, and introduces new letters to test. “BOING” satisfies:
- B O I N G → O is in position 2, N is in position 4.
- None of B, I, G are among the excluded letters.
- It also checks whether the word contains a second O (it doesn’t) and introduces three fresh letters (B, I, G).

Thus “BOING” is a good next guess.

- Position 2 = O (confirmed from MOUND and BOING)
- Position 3 = I (confirmed from BOING)
- Position 4 = N (confirmed from CRANE, MOUND, BOING)

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ O I N _

Letters that have been ruled out (x) are: C, R, A, E, M, U, D, B, G.

We need a 5‑letter English word matching _ O I N _ and using only letters not excluded. “LOINS” fits perfectly:
- L and S are not on the excluded list.
- It follows the pattern L O I N S.

Therefore the next guess should be LOINS.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 2 = O (confirmed)
- Position 3 = I (confirmed)
- Position 4 = N (confirmed)
- Positions 1 and 5 are still unknown.

All letters marked “x” are not in the word: C, R, A, E, M, U, D, B, G, L, S.

We need a 5‑letter English word of the form _ O I N _. Viable candidates that avoid the excluded letters include **POINT** (P‑O‑I‑N‑T) and **JOINT** (J‑O‑I‑N‑T). Both introduce two new, untested letters. I’ll choose **JOINT** to test J and T while fitting the pattern.
