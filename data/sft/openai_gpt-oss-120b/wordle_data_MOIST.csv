### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. “CRANE” is a frequent starter because it tests three of the most common letters (C, R, N) and both vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

The feedback indicates that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that uses only other letters. “SMITH” contains S, M, I, T, H, none of which have been ruled out, so it’s a valid next guess.

From feedback:
- C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- H is not in the word.
- I is correct at position 3.
- S, M, and T are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (S not 1, M not 2, T not 4).

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ _ I _ _ containing S, M, T and one other letter, respecting the position constraints.

Trying placements:
- Put M at position 1 (allowed), T at position 5 (allowed), and S at position 4 (allowed). The remaining slot (position 2) can be any allowed letter not yet used.
- The word “MOIST” fits this: M O I S T.
  - M is not in position 2.
  - S is not in position 1.
  - T is not in position 4.
  - All used letters are allowed, and O is a new allowed letter.

Thus “MOIST” is a valid next guess.
