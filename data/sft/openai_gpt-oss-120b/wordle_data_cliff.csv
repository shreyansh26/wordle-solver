### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback that the first letter C is correct, and the letters R, A, N, E are not present anywhere in the secret word. Therefore the secret word is of the form C _ _ _ _.

We have confirmed the first three letters C, L, I are correct and in the right positions. Excluded letters so far: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, M, B, P, S. Remaining letters not yet tried include F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with ""CLI"". Possible candidates: CLIFF (uses F, which hasn't been ruled out), CLINT (uses N, excluded), CLINK (uses N), CLIVE (uses E). CLIFF is the only common word fitting the pattern without using excluded letters.

Thus we guess ""CLIFF"".
