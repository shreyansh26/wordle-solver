### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with C and R at the first two positions. The letter A and N are not in the word at all. The letter E is present but not at the fifth position, so it must be in position 3 or 4. We need a valid 5‑letter word that fits the pattern C R _ _ _, includes an E in position 3 or 4, and does not use A or N.

A good candidate is **CREDO**:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, not position 5)
- No A or N present.

Thus we guess CREDO.
