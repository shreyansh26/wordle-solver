### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Secret word letters: R is correct at position 2 (green).
- A is in the word but not at positions 1,2,3 (from CRANE and ARROW feedback). So A must be at position 4 or 5.
- O, W, C, N, E are not in the word.
- The second R in ARROW received a “-”, meaning there is another R somewhere other than position 3. Since we already have a confirmed R at position 2, the word must contain a second R at position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Putting these together, the pattern is:
- Position 2 = R
- Position 4 or 5 = A
- Another R at position 1, 4, or 5 (not 3)
- No letters C, N, E, O, W

A five‑letter English word that satisfies all of these is **FRIAR**:
- F (unused letter)
- R at position 2 (green)
- I (new letter)
- A at position 4 (possible location for A)
- R at position 5 (second R, not at position 3)

This guess tests the remaining unknown letters while adhering to all known constraints.
