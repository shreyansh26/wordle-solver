### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- The secret word starts with R (position 1 is correct).
- U, L, C, A, N are not in the word.
- The letter E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and it is not at position 2 (since the first guess ruled that out). Therefore E must be in position 2 or 3.
- There is only one R (the second R in “RULER” got a minus, indicating the extra R isn’t present).

We need a new word that:
- Has R at the first position.
- Contains E at position 2 or 3.
- Avoids the disallowed letters (C, A, N, U, L).
- Introduces new letters to test.

A good candidate is **REMIT** (R E M I T). It satisfies all constraints and brings in new letters M, I, T for further clues.
