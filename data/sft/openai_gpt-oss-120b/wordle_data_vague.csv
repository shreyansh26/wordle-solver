### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: V (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 4: U (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)
- Position 3: L is not correct (x), so we need a different letter.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern V A _ U E, with the third letter not being any previously excluded letters (C,R,N,M,I,Z,P,S,L) and not already used unless allowed. A common English word that matches this pattern is **VAGUE** (V A G U E). The third letter G has not been ruled out, making this a logical next guess.
