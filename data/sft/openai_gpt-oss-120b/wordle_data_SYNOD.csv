### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first letter is S (✓). The letters L, A, T, E are not in the word at all. The next guess should keep S in the first position and avoid using L, A, T, E. Choose a common word with new letters to gather more information, such as “SWING” (S W I N G). This respects the constraints and introduces four new letters.

- Letter O is in the word but not in position 3 (O (-)).
- Letter N is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (N (-) from both guesses).

Thus N can only be in position 2 or 3. Since O cannot be in position 3, the only viable arrangements are:

2. S _ N O _   (N at 3, O at 2, 4, or 5)

- N in position 3 (allowed).
- O in position 4 (allowed, not position 3).
- Y and D are new letters not yet ruled out.
