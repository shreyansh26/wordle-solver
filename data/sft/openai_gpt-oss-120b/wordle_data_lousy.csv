### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From previous feedback:
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,F,P.
- Letters present but misplaced from FLOPS: L, O, S.
- From SOULY: O is correct at position 2, U correct at position 3, Y correct at position 5.
- L is present but not at position 4 (and not at positions 2,3,5), so L must be at position 1.
- S is present but not at position 1 (and not at 2,3,5), leaving position 4.
Thus the word pattern is L O U S Y, which forms the valid English word ""LOUSY"".
