### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter word. I’ll choose a common word containing a mix of common letters to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, which covers a range of common letters and positions.

The feedback tells me that the secret word ends with E, and the letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. I need a new guess that keeps E in the fifth position and uses other common letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “SLIDE” fits: S, L, I, D are new candidates, and E remains in the correct spot.

- Position 1 is still unknown.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern ""_ L I T E"". The common English word that matches this pattern and does not use any excluded letters is **ELITE** (E L I T E). This also reuses the letter E, which we have not ruled out from appearing elsewhere.

Therefore the next guess should be ""ELITE"".
