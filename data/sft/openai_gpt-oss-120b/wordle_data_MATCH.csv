### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Looking for a common 5‑letter English word with pattern _ A _ _ _, containing C at position 4 (since position 3 yields few options). “LATCH” fits:
- Letters: L A T C H
- No forbidden letters (B, E, I, N, R, S)
- A is at position 2 (✓)
- C is at position 4 (not 1 or 5, giving “-” feedback in both prior guesses)

Thus LATCH satisfies all constraints and is a good next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 2 = A (confirmed)
- Position 3 = T (confirmed)
- Position 4 = C (confirmed)
- Position 5 = H (confirmed)
- Position 1 is still unknown, but it cannot be any of the letters that have been marked as not in the word: L, B, R, N, E, I, S, (and also cannot be C, which we already know is at position 4). The remaining viable letters for position 1 include common options such as W, P, M, H, etc.

To test the first position, we choose a common word that fits the known pattern **_ A T C H** and introduces a new candidate letter at the first spot. “WATCH” satisfies this:
- Uses the known pattern.
- Introduces W, a letter not yet ruled out.
- Avoids all letters previously marked as absent.

Thus “WATCH” is the logical next guess.

We have determined the word pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 1 is still unknown, but cannot be any letters that have been marked as absent: R, N, E, B, S, I, L, W, and also cannot be C (already in position 4).

Possible remaining letters for position 1 that form a real English word with the pattern _ATCH include:

All three satisfy the constraints, but we need to make a guess. Choosing “MATCH” introduces a new first‑letter candidate (M) and uses only allowed letters.
