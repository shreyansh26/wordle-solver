### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.

So the next guess should include R in a different spot and avoid C, A, N, E. I’ll try a common word with R in the third slot and new letters: “PORTS”.

We have pattern from feedback:
- Positions 2,3,4 are confirmed O, R, T respectively.
- Letters not in word: C, A, N, E, P, S.
- Unknown letters for positions 1 and 5 must be from remaining alphabet, not those excluded.
A common English word matching _ O R T _ is ""FORTY"" (F O R T Y), which satisfies all constraints and uses new letters F and Y not yet ruled out.
Thus the next guess should be ""FORTY"".

We have deduced the pattern _ O R T _. From the third guess (FORTY) we confirmed F at position 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, and learned Y is not in the word. Therefore the secret word is F O R T _. The only remaining unknown letter is the fifth one, which must not be any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E, P, S, Y). The plausible English word fitting this pattern is ""FORTH"" (with H as the final letter). H has not been eliminated, so it is a valid next guess.
