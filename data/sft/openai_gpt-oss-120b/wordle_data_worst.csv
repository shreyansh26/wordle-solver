### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain the letters C, A, N, or E. The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. Therefore our next guess should:
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Include R, placed somewhere other than the second slot.
Choosing a common word meeting these criteria, “RUSTY” fits: it contains R (in the first position) and uses only letters U, S, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters **not** in the word: C, A, N, E, U, Y.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  - **R** is in the word, but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 1 (from RUSTY). So R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  - **S** is in the word, but not in position 3 (from RUSTY). So S can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  - **T** is in the word, but not in position 4 (from RUSTY). So T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a five‑letter English word that contains R, S, and T, respects those positional restrictions, and uses two additional letters that are not excluded.

The word **STRIP** (S‑T‑R‑I‑P) satisfies all conditions:
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- T is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- I and P are new letters not yet ruled out.

Thus “STRIP” is a valid next guess.
