### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- A is confirmed at position 2.
- C is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → C must be in position 4 or 5.
- T is in the word but cannot be in position 1 → T can be in position 3, 4, or 5 (position 2 is already A).
- Excluded letters: R, N, E, I, D, S, K, Y.

We need a valid 5‑letter word that:
1. Has A in the second slot.
2. Contains C (in slot 4 or 5) and T (not in slot 1).
3. Uses only letters not excluded.

The word **BATCH** satisfies all conditions:
- B A T C H
- A is at position 2 (fixed).
- T is at position 3 (allowed).
- C is at position 4 (allowed).
- B and H are new letters not yet ruled out.

Thus “BATCH” is a suitable next guess.

From the last feedback (BATCH):  
- B is not in the word.  
- A is correct at position 2.  
- T is correct at position 3.  
- C is correct at position 4.  
- H is correct at position 5.  

Thus the secret word has the pattern _ A T C H.  
The first letter cannot be any that have already been ruled out: B, R, N, E, I, D, S, K, Y, etc. Viable candidates include common words ending in “ATCH”: PATCH, MATCH, LATCH, WATCH, etc. I’ll test one of these, choosing “PATCH” to check if the first letter is P.
