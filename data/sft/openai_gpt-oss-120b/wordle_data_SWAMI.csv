### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:

- Position3 A is correct.
- Position4 Y is not in the word.
- Position5 S appears elsewhere (since the S at position4 got a “-”, meaning S is in the word but not at position4). Since we already have one S at position1, the second S must be at position5.

Thus the word pattern is: S W A _ S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a common English word with this pattern using only allowed letters (B, D, F, G, I, J, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus repeats of S or A).

- Contains no prohibited letters.

- Positions 1, 2, 3 are S, W, A (all ✓).
- Position 4 is unknown, but cannot be any letters that have received an “x” (G, Y, L, T, E, H, R, P, N, C, K). 
- Position 5 must be S (the “-” on the previous S indicates the second S is elsewhere, and the only remaining slot is position 5).

Thus the secret word is of the form SWA?S with the fourth letter being a letter not yet ruled out. The common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **SWABS** (B has not been tested and is not excluded). This is a valid 5‑letter word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be SWABS.
