### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is correct in position 2.
- E is correct in position 5.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- S and T are not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ L _ _ E, with A somewhere other than position 3, i.e., position 1 or 4. A guess should keep L and E fixed, place A in one of the allowed spots, and avoid S and T.

A valid word satisfying these constraints is **ALONE** (A L O N E). It puts A in position 1, keeps L and E in their known spots, and introduces new letters O and N for further clues.
