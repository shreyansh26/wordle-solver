### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- From SHOUT: S is in the word but not in position 1; H, O, U are not in the word; T is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with T, contains S somewhere in positions 2‑4, and uses none of the eliminated letters {C,R,A,N,E,H,O,U}. We need a new guess that respects these constraints and adds new letters to narrow possibilities.

A good candidate is **VISIT**:
- Ends with T (matches known correct position).
- Places S in position 3 (different from position 1).
- Introduces new letters V and I, which have not been tested yet.
- Uses only allowed letters (V, I, S, T).

So we will guess ""VISIT"".

- From VISIT: V is not in the word; I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4; S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3; T confirmed at position 5.

Thus:

- Remaining unknown letters can be tested.
