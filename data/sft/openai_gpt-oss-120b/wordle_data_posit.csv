### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. “CRANE” includes the common vowel A and the frequent consonants C, R, N, and E, which should help identify letters and their positions in the secret word.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as not present, so the secret word cannot contain any of those. I need a new 5‑letter word using only letters outside that set. Choosing common letters will give informative feedback. “SHOUT” uses S, H, O, U, T, all of which are allowed and gives a good mix of consonants and vowels.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From SHOUT: S is in the word but not in position 1; O is in the word but not in position 3; T is correct in position 5; H and U are not in the word.

Thus the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ T, contains S and O (with S not at position 1, O not at position 3). Remaining possible letters exclude {C,R,A,N,E,H,U}. A plausible word meeting all constraints is **POSIT** (P O S I T). Here:
- T is at position 5 (matches).
- O is at position 2 (not position 3, ok).
- S is at position 3 (not position 1, ok).
- No excluded letters are used.

So the next guess will be POSIT.
