### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a solid opening guess. A common strategy is to use a word that contains frequent letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. “CRANE” includes the common letters C, R, N, and the vowels A and E, giving good coverage for initial feedback.

We know from feedback that the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, each in a different position than guessed (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3). The letters N and E are not in the word at all. 

We need a new 5‑letter English word that includes C, R, and A, avoids N and E, and places those three letters in positions other than the ones they occupied in “CRANE”.  

“MACRO” satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A, C, R.
- Positions: M (1), A (2), C (3), R (4), O (5).  
  • A is not in position 3.  
  • C is not in position 1.  
  • R is not in position 2.  
- No N or E.
Thus “MACRO” is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed letters:

- Positions they cannot occupy:
  * A: not 2 or 3
  * C: not 1 or 3
  * R: not 2 or 4
- Excluded letters: N, E, M, O.

We need a word containing A, C, R plus two other allowable letters, respecting the position constraints.

Choose positions:
- A at 1 (allowed)
- C at 2 (allowed)
- R at 3 (allowed)

The pattern becomes **A C R _ _**. A common English word fitting this pattern is **ACRID** (meaning sharp or bitter). The remaining letters I and D are not excluded.
