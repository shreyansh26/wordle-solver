### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that only the last letter E is correct and in the right spot. The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all. For the next guess, we should use a different set of letters for the first four positions, still keep E in the fifth position, and avoid C, R, A, N. A word like “SLIDE” fits: it ends with E, and its other letters S, L, I, D are all new and allowed.

We know:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 correct from both guesses).
- Letter **S** is in the word but not in position 1 (it got a “‑” when guessed in position 1 of SLIDE). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters **C, R, A, N, L, I, D** are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Contains **S** somewhere other than the first position.
3. Introduces only letters we haven’t ruled out.

A good candidate is **POSSE**:
- Pattern: P O S S E → E is correctly placed, S appears in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed), and the new letters P and O have not been tested yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus we’ll guess **POSSE**.
