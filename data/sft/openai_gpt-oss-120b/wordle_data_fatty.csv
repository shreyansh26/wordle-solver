### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- FATTY
- CATTY (less common)

We need to test the first letter. Choosing a common word, “PATTY” will confirm if P is correct; if not, the feedback will eliminate P and narrow it down to the remaining options.

Therefore, the next guess is “PATTY”.

We have determined the pattern _ A T T Y from feedback. Letters already ruled out for the first position are B, P, S, L, M, R. Viable remaining common words fitting the pattern are NATTY, FATTY, CATTY, and possibly WATTY. Among these, FATTY and NATTY are the most common. Since we have only one guess left, we need to choose one. I'll guess ""FATTY"" as it hasn't been tested yet and is a common word.
