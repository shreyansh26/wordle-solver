### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starting word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good candidate because it contains C, R, A, N, E, covering a blend of consonants and the vowel A/E.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5 correct) and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N anywhere. I need a new five‑letter guess that respects these constraints. Choosing a common word with diverse letters will give useful information. “SLIDE” ends with E, uses S, L, I, D which we haven’t tested yet, and avoids C, R, A, N. It’s a valid English word, so it’s a good next guess.
