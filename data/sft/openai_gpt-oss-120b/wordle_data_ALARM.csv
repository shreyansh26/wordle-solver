### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- A is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at position 2, so it could be 1, 4, or 5.
- C, N, and E are not in the word.

We need a new word with A third, containing R in a position other than 2, and avoiding C, N, E.  
The word **SMART** fits:
- Pattern S M A R T → A third, R fourth (new position).
- Uses none of the excluded letters (C, N, E).
- Introduces new letters S, M, T to gain more information.
Thus, SMART is a good next guess.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Position 3 is A (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 4 is R (✓ from guess 2).
- The letter M is in the word but not in position 2 (‑ from guess 2). Therefore M must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, E, S, T.
- R is already correctly placed at position 4, so no other positions need R.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form **_ _ A R _** that includes M (in position 1 or 5) and avoids the excluded letters.

The word **ALARM** fits perfectly:
- Pattern: A L A R M → A at position 3, R at position 4.
- M is at position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus ALARM is a valid next guess.
