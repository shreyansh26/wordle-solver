### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, O, T are not in the word.
- Letters S, H, U are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
  * S was guessed at position 1 → S is NOT at position 1.
  * H was guessed at position 2 → H is NOT at position 2.
  * U was guessed at position 4 → U is NOT at position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word containing S, H, U (to test their correct spots) and two other letters that haven’t been ruled out. The word **HUSKY** satisfies all constraints:
- H is at position 1 (allowed).
- U is at position 2 (allowed; only position 4 is forbidden for U).
- S is at position 3 (allowed; only position 1 is forbidden for S).
- K and Y are new letters, not previously eliminated.
Thus the guess follows the game’s rules and will give us more information.

We have determined the word pattern is ? U S H Y with positions 2‑5 fixed. The first letter cannot be C,R,A,N,E,O,T,K,B (eliminated) and must be a valid English word. Possible candidates are GUSHY, LUSHY, MUSHY, PUSHY. We have two guesses left; choose one to test, then if incorrect use the last guess for another candidate. Selecting the most common candidate, “MUSHY”.
