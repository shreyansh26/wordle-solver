### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- E is in the word at position 2 (exact match).
- D is in the word but not at position 5; it also cannot be at position 2 (occupied by E).

Thus the pattern is: _ E _ _ _. D must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Choosing a common word that respects all exclusions, “SEEDY” fits:
- Position 1: S (allowed)

We have these constraints from the feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **E** (confirmed by the ✓ on the second guess).
- The letter **D** is in the word but not in position 5 (first guess) nor position 4 (third guess). The “-” on position 4 in the third guess tells us D isn’t there, so D must be in position 1 or 3.
- All other letters used so far are not in the secret word: C, R, A, N, G, L, I, S, Y (all got an “x”). The second E in “SEEDY” also got a “-”, meaning there is only one E in the word.
- Position 5 cannot be E (from the first guess) and cannot be D (from the second guess).

So the pattern is:

1️⃣ ? 2️⃣ E 3️⃣ ? 4️⃣ ? 5️⃣ ?

With D occupying either slot 1 or 3, and the remaining slots filled with letters that have not been ruled out (e.g., B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z).

A good test word that respects all of these constraints is **DETOX**:
- D in position 1 (possible location for D)
- E in position 2 (the known correct spot)
- T, O, X are all letters we haven’t eliminated.

This guess will tell us whether D is indeed at position 1 (if the first letter gets a ✓) and will test three new letters.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have these constraints from the feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **E** (confirmed by the ✓ on the second guess).
- The letter **D** is in the word but not in position 5 (first guess) nor position 4 (third guess). The “-” on position 4 in the third guess tells us D isn’t there, so D must be in position 1 or 3.
- All other letters used so far are not in the secret word: C, R, A, N, G, L, I, S, Y (all got an “x”). The second E in “SEEDY” also got a “-”, meaning there is only one E in the word.
- Position 5 cannot be E (from the first guess) and cannot be D (from the second guess).

So the pattern is:

1️⃣ ? 2️⃣ E 3️⃣ ? 4️⃣ ? 5️⃣ ?

With D occupying either slot 1 or 3, and the remaining slots filled with letters that have not been ruled out (e.g., B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z).

A good test word that respects all of these constraints is **DETOX**:
- D in position 1 (possible location for D)
- E in position 2 (the known correct spot)
- T, O, X are all letters we haven’t eliminated.

This guess will tell us whether D is indeed at position 1 (if the first letter gets a ✓) and will test three new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
