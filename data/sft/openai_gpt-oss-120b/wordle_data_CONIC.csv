### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Therefore the secret word starts with C, contains an N somewhere other than the fourth slot, and contains none of R, A, or E. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **CYNIC** (C Y N I C): it keeps C at the start, places N in position 3 (allowed), and avoids the excluded letters.

- Guess 2 (CYNIC): C is correct in positions 1 and 5; Y is not in the word; N is correct in position 3; I is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word must have:
- C at positions 1 and 5,
- N at position 3,
- I at position 4,
- a second letter that is not R, A, E, Y.

The pattern is C _ N I C. The only common English word that fits this pattern while respecting the excluded letters is **CONIC** (O is not excluded). Therefore the next guess should be CONIC.
