### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- S is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 5; therefore S must be at position 2 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, L, F, D.
We need a word of the form _ _ E _ _. Placing S at position 4 works well, and we can introduce new letters not yet tested. “GEESE” fits the pattern (E at 3, S at 4), uses new letter G, repeats allowed letters, and avoids all excluded letters.

We have deduced the secret word pattern:

- Position 3 is E (confirmed by SHELF and GEESE).
- Position 4 is S (confirmed by GEESE).
- Letters C, R, A, N, H, L, F, D, G are not in the word.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (feedback from GEESE).
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (feedback from earlier guesses), and we now know S is exactly at position 4.

Thus the word must be of the form **_ _ E S _** with no excluded letters.

A common English word fitting this pattern and avoiding all excluded letters is **QUEST** (Q U E S T). It respects all constraints:
- Q, U, T are not among the excluded letters.
- E is at position 3, S at position 4.
- No other letters violate prior feedback.

So the next guess should be “QUEST”.
