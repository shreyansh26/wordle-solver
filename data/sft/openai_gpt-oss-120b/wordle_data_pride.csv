### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common, balanced 5‑letter word that uses frequent letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.  
“CRANE” contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two of the most common vowels (A, E), giving a good chance of hitting letters in the secret word and providing useful positional clues for the next guesses.

We know the secret word has R in position 2 and E in position 5. The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word fitting the pattern _ R _ _ E without using C, A, or N. “PROBE” matches the pattern (P‑R‑O‑B‑E) and respects the exclusions, so it’s a good next guess.
