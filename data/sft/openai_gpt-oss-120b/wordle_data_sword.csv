### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""SLATE"" is a good starter because it uses frequent letters S, L, A, T, E and can give useful information about both consonants and the vowel placement.

We know the secret word starts with S (✓ in position 1). The letters L, A, T, E are not in the word at all, so they must be avoided in future guesses. The next guess should keep S at the first position and use five new letters that are not L, A, T, or E, while also trying common letters to narrow down the solution. “SCORN” satisfies these constraints: it begins with S, and uses C, O, R, N, none of which have been ruled out.
