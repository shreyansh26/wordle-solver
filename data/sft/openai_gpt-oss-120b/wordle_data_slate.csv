2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from feedback that the secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position, while letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all. Therefore the pattern is __A_E. We need a common word fitting this pattern and avoiding the excluded letters. ""SHADE"" matches: S H A D E, with new letters S, H, D that haven't been ruled out.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Incorrect letters: C, R, N, H, D (all marked x). So we need a word of form S _ A _ E using letters not yet eliminated. Candidates include ""STAKE"", ""SLATE"", ""SMASH"" (but last letter wrong), etc. Both ""STAKE"" and ""SLATE"" fit and use only allowed letters. I’ll guess ""SLATE"".
