### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letters L, A, and E, each of which is in the wrong position in all previous guesses.

Constraints:
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 → possible positions 3 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → possible positions 1 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → possible positions 2 or 3.

One arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is:
1 ?   2 E   3 L   4 L   5 A

The word **FELLA** fits this pattern, uses only allowed letters, and introduces a new letter F for additional information.
