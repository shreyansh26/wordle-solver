### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, X, S.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  * N is in the word, not in position 1 (from NEXUS) and not in position 4 (from CRANE). So N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
  * E is in the word, not in position 2 (from NEXUS) and not in position 5 (from CRANE). So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  * U is in the word, not in position 4 (from NEXUS). So U can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains N, E, and U in allowable positions, plus two other letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is **NEXUS**:
- Contains N (position 1, allowed) and E (position 2, allowed).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (X, U, S are fresh).
- Meets all positional constraints.

Thus we will guess NEXUS.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, X, S.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  * N is in the word, not in position 1 (from NEXUS) and not in position 4 (from CRANE). So N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
  * E is in the word, not in position 2 (from NEXUS) and not in position 5 (from CRANE). So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  * U is in the word, not in position 4 (from NEXUS). So U can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains N, E, and U in allowable positions, plus two other letters that haven’t been ruled out.

The word **UNWED** fits all constraints:
- U at position 1 (allowed),
- N at position 2 (allowed),
- W at position 3 (new letter, not ruled out),
- E at position 4 (allowed),
- D at position 5 (new letter, not ruled out).

All excluded letters (C, R, A, X, S) are absent, and the positional restrictions for N, E, and U are satisfied.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
