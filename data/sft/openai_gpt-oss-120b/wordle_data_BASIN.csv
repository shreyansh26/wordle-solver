### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and N, placed elsewhere, and must avoid C, R, E. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is “ALIGN” (A at position 1, N at position 5, no C/R/E).

We have determined the following from the feedback:
- N is confirmed at position 5.
- A is present but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4, so it must be at position 2.
- I is present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving position 4 as the only option.
Thus the word pattern is _ A _ I N.

We need letters for positions 1 and 3 that haven’t been ruled out. 
The word **BASIN** fits the pattern (B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, N at 5) and uses only letters not excluded by earlier guesses.

So the next guess is “BASIN”.
