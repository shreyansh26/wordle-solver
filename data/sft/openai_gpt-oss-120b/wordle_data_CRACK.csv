### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good opening guess is **CRANE** – it includes the vowels A and E and the frequent consonants C, R, N. This should provide a solid base for the feedback.

We know the secret word starts with C,R,A in the first three positions. The letters N, E, S, and H are not in the word at all. Therefore the pattern is C R A _ _. We need a common English word that fits this pattern and does not use the excluded letters. Possible candidates include “CRAZY” (adding Z and Y) and “CRAWL” (adding W and L). Both are valid words and introduce new letters to test. I’ll choose “CRAZY” to check Z and Y.

Both fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters. I will test “CRACK” first, as it introduces a new letter K and repeats C, giving useful information for the remaining unknown letters.
