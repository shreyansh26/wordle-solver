### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. I'll choose a word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter word in these games because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback.

From the first guess CRANE I got:
- C, A, N are not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

So the secret word must contain R and E, with R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot. I need a new 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints and does not use C, A, or N.

A good candidate is **RILED**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- I, L, D are new letters (none of which have been ruled out).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, not position 5).

Thus “RILED” follows all the feedback rules and will give more information.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 2 is **I** (✓ from “RILED”).
- Position 4 is **E** (✓ from “RILED”).
- The word contains **R**, but not in positions 1 or 2 (both gave “-”). So R can be in positions 3 or 5.
- The word contains **L**, but not in position 3 (gave “-”). So L can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, but positions 2 and 4 are already I and E, so L can be in positions 1 or 5.
- Letters **C, A, N, D** are not in the word (all got “x”).

Thus the pattern is: _ I _ E _.  
We need to place L and R (and one additional letter) respecting the above constraints.

A valid English word that fits is **LIVER**:
- L at position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- I at position 2 (✓).
- V at position 3 (new letter, not yet ruled out).
- E at position 4 (✓).
- R at position 5 (allowed, not positions 1 or 2).

All constraints are satisfied, so “LIVER” is a strong next guess.
