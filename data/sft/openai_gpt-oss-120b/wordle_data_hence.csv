### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E that includes C and N in different positions (C not 1st, N not 4th). “UNCLE” fits:

We have the following information from feedback:

- Position 5 is definitely **E** (both guesses gave a ✓ at the last letter).
- The secret word contains the letters **C** and **N**, but:
  * **C** is **not** in positions 1 or 3.
  * **N** is **not** in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters **R, A, U, L** are not in the word at all.

Thus the remaining possible placements are:
- **C** can be at position 2 or 4.
- **N** can be at position 1 or 3.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **WINCE**:
- Pattern: W I N C E
- N is at position 3 (allowed), C at position 4 (allowed), ending with E.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “WINCE”.
