### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R is in the word but not in position 2.

So the new guess must include R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From ROLES: R is still not in position 1 (so R cannot be 1 or 2). O, L, S are not in the word. E is also not in position 4. 

Thus:
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4 or 5).
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, O, L, S.
We need a valid 5‑letter word containing R and E that respects these position restrictions and avoids the excluded letters.

A good candidate is **EXERT**:
- Positions: E(1) X(2) E(3) R(4) T(5)
- E is in positions 1 and 3 (allowed), R is in position 4 (allowed).
- No excluded letters appear.

This guess will test the remaining possible letters and further narrow down the secret word.

We have determined the exact positions of the known letters:

- R cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 (feedback from all guesses) → must be at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ R.

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching the pattern with none of the excluded letters. “DEFER” (D E F E R) fits:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
