### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3.

So the next guess must:
1. Exclude letters C, R, N, E.
2. Include the letter A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. Test new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **BALMY**:
- Contains A at position 2 (different from position 3).
- Introduces new common letters B, L, M, Y.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus I will submit “BALMY”.
