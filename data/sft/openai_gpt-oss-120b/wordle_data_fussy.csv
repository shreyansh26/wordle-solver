### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- Positions: 1 ?, 2 U (correct), 3 S (correct), 4 ?, 5 Y (correct).
- Letters eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,B,L,O,W,D,K plus any not in word.
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are from the set {F,J,P,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z, ...}. Duplicate S is allowed.

A common English word fitting “? U S ? Y” with allowed letters is **FUSSY** (F U S S Y). All its letters are not ruled out, and it respects the known positions.
