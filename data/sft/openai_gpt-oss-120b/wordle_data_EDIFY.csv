### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, B, L, D.
- The letter E is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” at positions 3‑4 in BLEED and “-” at position 5 in CRANE). Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.
We need a new guess that:
- Places E in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

Choosing **EIGHT** puts E in position 1 and tests the new letters I, G, H, T, none of which have been eliminated yet.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined:
- Position 1 is definitely **E** (✓ from guess 3).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, B, L, D, G, H, T, I** are not in the word (all marked x).
- The letter **E** is not in positions 2‑5 (from earlier “-” marks).
Thus positions 2‑5 must be filled with letters not among the excluded set. Viable letters include **F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

Choosing a word that:
- Keeps **E** at the first position.
- Uses only unexplored letters for the remaining slots.
- Introduces several new letters to maximize information.

**EPOXY** satisfies these criteria:
- E is in position 1 (confirmed).
- P, O, X, Y have not been tried yet and are all allowed.
- No excluded letters appear.

This guess will tell us which of P, O, X, Y belong in the secret word and their positions.

We have gathered the following information:

| Letter | Status |
|--------|--------|
| E | ✓ at position 1 (confirmed) |
| Y | ✓ at position 5 (confirmed) |
| I | “-” at position 2 → I is in the word but **not** at position 2; cannot be position 5 (occupied by Y), so I must be in position 3 or 4. |
| D | “-” at position 5 in BLEED → D is in the word but **not** at position 5; could be position 2, 3, or 4. |
| P, O, X, C, R, A, N, B, L, G, H, T | marked “x” → not in the word. |

Thus the secret word fits the pattern:

**E _ _ _ Y**

with the remaining letters to place being I and D (in positions 2‑4) plus one additional letter that we haven’t tested yet.  
Position 2 cannot be I (since I was “-” at position 2), so position 2 must be D or the new letter.  
Positions 3 and 4 must contain I and the other of {D, new letter}.

A common English word satisfying all constraints is **EDIFY**:

- E in position 1 (✓)  
- D in position 2 (allowed)  
- I in position 3 (I is allowed here)  
- F in position 4 (new letter, not yet eliminated)  
- Y in position 5 (✓)

This guess will confirm the placement of D and I and test the new letter F.
