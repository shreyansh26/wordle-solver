### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must start with **C**, contain **R** somewhere other than the second spot, contain **E** somewhere other than the fifth spot, and must not contain **A** or **N**.

Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints helps gather new information.  
“CORES” fits:
- C at position 1 (matches known correct letter).
- R at position 3 (R is present but not at position 2, satisfying the rule).
- E at position 4 (E is present but not at position 5, satisfying the rule).
- No A or N are used.

Thus “CORES” is a valid next guess that respects all known information while introducing new letters (O, S) for further clues.

- Position 1 is C (✓).

- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it must be position 5.
