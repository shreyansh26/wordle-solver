### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S, L, A, T are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the next guess should avoid S, L, A, T entirely and place E somewhere other than the last slot. A good candidate is **COVER**, which includes E in the 4th position and introduces new letters C, O, V, R for further information.

From the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, C, O, V, R are not in the secret word.
- The letter E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (it was wrong in those spots in both guesses).

Thus E must be in position 1, 2, or 3. We need four other letters that are not among the eliminated ones. A good candidate using allowable letters and placing E early is **ENEMY** (E in position 1, other letters N, M, Y are all still possible).
