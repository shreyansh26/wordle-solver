# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From earlier feedback:

- O is in the word but not in position 1 (O(-) from OLDER), so O must be in position 2 or 3.

Excluded letters (marked x): C, A, N, M, I, T, L, D, S, U.  
Letters still possible for the remaining spots are B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and O (which must appear in pos 2 or 3).

We need a common 5‑letter word of the form ___ER with E at 4 and R at 5, containing O at position 2 or 3 and avoiding excluded letters.  
The word **BOWER** fits perfectly:

- No excluded letters are used,
- R is only at position 5,

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 4 is **E** (✓ from multiple guesses).
- Position 5 is **R** (✓ from several guesses).
- The letter **W** is in the word but not in position 3 (‑ from BOWER), so the only remaining spot for W is position 1.
- All letters marked x are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, L, D, S, U, B, plus any other letters we have not used yet are still possible.
Thus the pattern is **W O _ E R**.

The only unknown letter is the third position. It must be a letter not yet eliminated. A reasonable common choice is **K**, giving the word **WOKER**. This introduces a new letter (K) while respecting all known constraints.
