### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to make an initial guess for a 5‑letter Wordle‑style game. A good first word uses common letters and covers a variety of frequent consonants and vowels. “CRANE” contains the frequent letters C, R, N, and the two most common vowels A and E, making it a solid starter.

The feedback tells me that only the last letter “E” is correct and in the right place. All other letters (C, R, A, N) are not in the word at all, so my next guess must avoid those letters entirely and still end with “E”. I’ll choose a common word that introduces new letters and keeps “E” at the fifth position. “SLIDE” fits: it ends with E and uses S, L, I, D, none of which have been ruled out.

We know the secret word has E correct at position 5, and L correct at position 2. All other letters from previous guesses (C, R, A, N, S, I, D) are not in the word. So the pattern is _ L _ _ E, avoiding those letters.
