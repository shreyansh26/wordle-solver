1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common initial guess that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening word because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

The first letter is confirmed as C. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. I need a new five‑letter word that starts with C and avoids those letters. A good candidate is **CLOUD** (C L O U D), which satisfies all constraints and introduces several new common letters.

We have determined that the first four letters are C L O U in that exact order, and the fifth letter is not D. The only common English word fitting ""CLOU?"" is ""CLOUT"". This satisfies all known constraints.
