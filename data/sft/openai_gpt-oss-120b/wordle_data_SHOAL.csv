### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a solid opening guess. A common first guess is “SLATE” because it contains frequently used letters and covers a mix of vowels and consonants. This will give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 2, so it can be 3, 4, or 5.
- A is in the word but not in position 3, so it can be 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 which is S).
- T and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word starting with S, containing L and A in allowed spots, and avoiding T and E.  
The word **SOLAR** fits:
- S in position 1 (matches ✓).
- L in position 3 (different from position 2, allowed).
- A in position 4 (different from position 3, allowed).
- No T or E present.
Thus it will give us more information about the remaining letters.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1: S (correct).
- Position 4: A (correct).
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it must be position 5.
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 2, so with L fixed at 5, O must be position 3.
Thus the pattern is **S _ O A L**.

We need a valid 5‑letter word fitting that pattern. The word **SHOAL** (S H O A L) matches exactly, using a new letter H for the unknown second slot, and satisfies all previous feedback.

Hence the next guess should be SHOAL.
