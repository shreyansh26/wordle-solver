### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess tells us that the secret word ends with **E** (the fifth letter), and none of the letters C, R, A, N appear anywhere in the word.  
We need a new 5‑letter word that has **E** in the fifth position and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.  
Choosing a word with several fresh letters will give us the most information. “GLIDE” fits: it ends with E, and introduces G, L, I, D – all currently untested.

- U is not in the word (x).

Thus the word pattern is: _ O _ _ E, with L in position 3 or 4, and S in position 1 or 3 (but not both in the same spot). The only common English word satisfying these constraints is **SOLVE** (S at 1, O at 2, L at 3, V at 4, E at 5). V has not been tried yet, and it respects all positional rules.
