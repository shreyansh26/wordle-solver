We know the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5.  
From PHAGE we learned:
- P is not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 2 → H must be in position 1 or 4.
- G is not in the word.

All other letters guessed earlier (C,R,N,S,L,T,Q,U,K) are also excluded.

So the pattern is _ _ A _ E with H at position 1 or 4, using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

The word **HEAVE** fits:
- H is at position 1 (acceptable, since H cannot be at position 2).
- E at position 2 is allowed (E is already known to be correct at position 5, duplicates are fine).
- A at position 3 matches the confirmed A.
- V at position 4 is a new allowed letter.
- E at position 5 matches the confirmed E.

Thus HEAVE is a valid next guess.
