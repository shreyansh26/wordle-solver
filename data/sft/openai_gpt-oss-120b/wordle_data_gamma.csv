### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word:

We need a new guess that respects these constraints and tests new letters. “MANIA” fits:

We have confirmed the secret word pattern is **_ A _ _ A** (A at positions 2 and 5).  
Excluded letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, D, M, N, I, J, F.  
Allowed letters for the remaining slots (1, 3, 4) are the rest of the alphabet: B, C, G, H, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

To maximize information, choose a word that uses three new, allowed letters in those slots.  
“BAGUA” fits the pattern **B A G U A**, testing B, G, and U while respecting all constraints.

If the secret is one of the plausible candidates (e.g., BABKA, YAKKA, HAKKA, BAGUA, etc.), the feedback from this guess will let us pinpoint the exact word with one final attempt.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Thus the secret word:
- Contains A at position 2.
- Contains a second A at position 1 or 5.
- Contains none of the letters S, L, T, E, R, D.

We need a new guess that respects these constraints and tests new letters. “MANIA” fits:
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- Another A is at position 5 (allowed).
- Uses only new letters M, N, I besides the required As.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

So we guess ""MANIA"".
