### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE, we know:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in CRANE).

Thus the next guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, E.
- Include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).

A good common word that satisfies these constraints is “NIGHT” (N at position 1, and none of the banned letters appear).

We have determined:
- I is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- Y is in the word but not at position 4, so Y must be at position 1 or 5. Most common words place Y at the end.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, G, H, T, B, S, O, V, L, plus any that showed x in prior guesses.

Thus the pattern is _ I N _ Y. A good candidate that introduces new letters (P and K) and fits all constraints is **PINKY**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess CRANE, we know:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in CRANE).

Thus the next guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, E.
- Include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).

A good common word that satisfies these constraints is “NIGHT” (N at position 1, and none of the banned letters appear).

We need a 5‑letter word that fits the pattern _ I _ _ _.  
Possible placements for N:
- If N is at position 3: pattern _ I N _ _. Example: **FINKS** (F I N K S) – uses only allowed letters.
- If N is at position 5: pattern _ I _ _ N. Example: **BISON** (B I S O N) – also uses only allowed letters.
