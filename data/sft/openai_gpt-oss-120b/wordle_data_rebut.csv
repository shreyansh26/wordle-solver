### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C, A, N, P, I, L are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 2.
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3.

Thus the secret word has pattern: _ E _ _ _ with R somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
Choosing a word that satisfies these constraints and avoids the excluded letters, “RESET” works:
- Position 1 = R (allowed),
- Position 2 = E (confirmed),
- Positions 3‑5 use letters S, E, T, none of which have been ruled out.
So “RESET” is a valid next guess.

A valid candidate is **REWET** (R‑E‑W‑E‑T):
- Matches the known R‑E‑_‑_‑T pattern.
- Uses a second E at position 4, which aligns with the “-” feedback for the E in RESET (present elsewhere, not at position 4).
- Introduces new letters W and avoids all banned letters.

Therefore, the next guess will be REWET.

We have gathered the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C ×, R –, A ×, N ×, E – => R and E are in the word, but not in those positions.
- Guess 2 (PERIL): P ×, E ✓ (pos 2), R –, I ×, L × => E is confirmed at position 2; R is elsewhere (not pos 2 or 3).
- Guess 3 (RESET): R ✓ (pos 1), E ✓ (pos 2), S ×, E –, T ✓ (pos 5) => Positions 1, 2, 5 are R‑E‑‑‑T. The second E (pos 4) is present elsewhere, so the word contains at least one more E (not at pos 4). S is not in the word.
- Guess 4 (REWET): R ✓, E ✓, W ×, E –, T ✓ => W is not in the word; the extra E (pos 4) again indicates the word has another E besides the one at position 2.

Thus the pattern is **R E _ _ T**, with the possibility of a second E occupying position 3 (since position 4 is ruled out). Letters confirmed absent: C, A, N, P, I, L, S, W.  

A common English word fitting the pattern and using only letters not yet excluded is **REBUT** (R‑E‑B‑U‑T). It respects the known positions and introduces two new letters (B, U) to test the remaining possibilities.

So the next guess should be:
