### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is present but not in the fifth position. Therefore the next guess should include E in a different position and avoid using C, R, A, N. A good candidate is “ELITE”, which places E at the first position (and also at the fifth, but the first E satisfies the requirement) and introduces new common letters L, I, T.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C,R,A,N are not in the word; E is in the word but not at position 5.
- From ELITE: T is correct at position 4; L and I are not in the word; E is also not at positions 1 or 5.

Thus:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, L, I.
- T is definitely the 4th letter.
- E must be somewhere other than positions 1, 4, or 5 → it can be position 2 or 3.
- Positions 1, 2 (or 3), and 5 still need letters we haven't tested.

A word that satisfies all known constraints is **HEFTY**:
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- T is at position 4 (matches the ✓).
- No forbidden letters appear.
- Introduces new letters H, F, Y for further testing.

So the next guess is HEFTY.
