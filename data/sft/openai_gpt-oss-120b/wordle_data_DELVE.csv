### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

2. The letter **L** is somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 2.
3. The letters **C, R, A, N, S, M, I, T, F, U, K** are not in the word.

We need a new guess that:
- Ends with **E**.
- Contains **L** in a position other than 2 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **LODGE**:
- Ends with E.
- Places L at position 1 (acceptable).
- Introduces new letters O, D, G, none of which have been eliminated yet.

This guess will test three fresh letters while respecting all known constraints.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 5 is **E** (consistent in all guesses).
- Letter **L** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from FLUKE and LODGE). So L can be in position 3 or 4.
- Letter **D** is in the word but not in position 3 (from LODGE). D can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, S, M, I, T, F, U, K, O, G.
- All other letters are still possible.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in **E**, containing **L** (pos 3 or 4) and **D** (pos 1, 2, or 4), and using only allowed letters.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **DELLE**:
- Pattern D E L L E → ends with E.
- Contains L (positions 3 and 4, both allowed).
- Contains D (position 1, allowed).
- Uses only letters D, E, L, which have not been ruled out.

Thus we will guess **DELLE**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
