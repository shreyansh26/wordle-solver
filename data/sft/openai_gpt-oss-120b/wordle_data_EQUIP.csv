### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5. For the next guess I should avoid C, R, A, N and place E somewhere other than the fifth slot. Choosing a mix of other common letters gives the best chance to get more information. “LIMES” satisfies these constraints: it contains E at position 4 and uses new letters L, I, M, S.

- From LIMES: L,M,S are not in the word (x). I is in the word but not in position 2 (‑). E is in the word but not in position 4 (‑).

Thus the secret word contains **E** and **I**, with the following position restrictions:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5; it must be in positions 1‑3.
- I cannot be in position 2.

All other letters tried (C,R,A,N,L,M,S) are excluded.

Choose a word that includes E and I respecting those positions and using only new letters.  
The word **EDIFY** fits:
- E is at position 1 (allowed).
- I is at position 3 (allowed, not position 2).
- New letters D, F, Y have not been eliminated.

So the next guess is “EDIFY”.

We have determined:
- Position 1 is E (from EDIFY feedback ✔).
- I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from LIMES and EDIFY feedback). Therefore I must be in position 4 or 5.
- All letters marked x are not in the secret word: C, R, A, N, L, M, S, D, F, Y.
- Remaining unused letters that are still possible include Q, U, P, etc.

A word that fits all constraints is **EQUIP**:
- Starts with E (correct position).
- Contains I at position 4 (allowed).
- Uses only new letters Q, U, P that have not been eliminated.
Thus it will give new information about the secret word.

Now we submit the guess.
