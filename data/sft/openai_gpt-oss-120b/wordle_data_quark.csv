### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter in these games because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position (A is ✓ at position 3).
- It contains the letter R, but R is not in position 2 (R got a “‑”).
- Letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Keeps A at the 3rd spot.
2. Includes R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Avoids C, N, and E.

A good candidate is **STARK**:
- Pattern: S T A R K → A is still in position 3.
- R appears in position 4 (not position 2).
- No C, N, or E are used.

This will test new letters S, T, K while respecting all known constraints.

We have determined the known pattern from feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓ from first guess).
- Position 4 is R (✓ from second guess).
- Position 5 is K (✓ from second guess).
- Letters S, T, C, N, E are confirmed not present.
Thus the secret word must be of the form **__ARK**.

A valid English word fitting this pattern and not using any excluded letters is **QUARK** (Q U A R K). This will test the remaining unknown letters Q and U while keeping the known correct letters in place.
