### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R is in the word but cannot be at positions 2 or 3.
- E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 5.

Thus we need a word with pattern: _ A _ _ _. It must include R and E, with R placed in positions 1,4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3) and E placed in positions 3 or 4 (but not 1 or 5). The word must avoid C, N, T, H.

The word **LAYER** satisfies all these constraints:
- A is at position 2.
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are present.
- All letters are common English words.

So the next guess is LAYER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
Thus:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E, avoids C and N, and places those letters in different positions from before. “EARTH” satisfies these constraints:
- Contains E, A, R.
- Positions: E 1, A 2, R 3, T 4, H 5.
- None of the letters are in the forbidden positions, and C/N are absent.
So the next guess will be EARTH.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, N, T, H.
- A is confirmed at position 2.
- R is in the word but cannot be at positions 2 or 3.
- E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 5.

Thus we need a word with pattern: _ A _ _ _. It must include R and E, with R placed in positions 1,4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3) and E placed in positions 3 or 4 (but not 1 or 5). The word must avoid C, N, T, H.

The word **LAYER** satisfies all these constraints:
- A is at position 2.
- R is at position 5 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are present.
- All letters are common English words.

So the next guess is LAYER.
