### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, information‑rich five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both a vowel (A, E) and frequent consonants. I’ll use that as my first guess.

The first guess “CRANE” received feedback indicating that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid all those letters. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word that uses letters not yet ruled out. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, and T, none of which have been eliminated, so it’s a good candidate for the next attempt.

We need a 5‑letter English word containing M and H (in different positions) and avoiding all prohibited letters.  
""SMUSH"" fits:
- Contains M (position 2, not position 1) and H (position 5, not position 4).
- Uses only allowed letters S, U, which are not prohibited.
