### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, covering several common consonants and a vowel.

The first guess CRANE gave feedback that C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word, while E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore the secret word must contain an E somewhere in positions 1‑4, and must avoid the letters C, R, A, N altogether.

For the next guess I’ll choose a word that:
- Places E in a different position (not 5th).
- Introduces new letters to test.
- Does not use any of the eliminated letters.

The word “TILED” fits these criteria: it has E in position 4, and adds the letters T, I, L, D for further testing, while avoiding C, R, A, N.

From the feedback:
- T is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.
- D is correct at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T.

We need a word of the form _ _ _ E D that contains both I and L, with I not at position 2 and L not at position 3.  
The word **PLIED** (P‑L‑I‑E‑D) satisfies:
- Position 4 = E, position 5 = D.
- Contains L at position 2 (allowed) and I at position 3 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Thus “PLIED” is a valid next guess.
