### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed positions from feedback:
- Position 1: C is correct.
- Position 2: U is correct.
- Position 3: R is correct.
- Position 5: Y is correct.

Position 4 is still unknown. From the third guess (CURRY), the R in position 4 received a “-”, meaning R is in the word but not in that spot. Since we already have R correctly placed at position 3, the secret word cannot have an R at position 4.

Letters eliminated so far:
- A, N, E (from the first guess)
- L (from the second guess)

Thus the pattern we need is **C U R _ Y**, with the fourth letter being something other than R, L, A, N, or E.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **CURFY** (meaning “having curves”). The fourth letter would be F, which has not been ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “CURFY”.

The confirmed letters and positions are:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 3: R (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Position 4 is still unknown. From previous feedback:
- R at position 4 was marked “-”, so it cannot be R.
- F at position 4 (in CURFY) was marked “x”, so it cannot be F.
- L, A, N, E have also been ruled out.

We need a common English word fitting the pattern **C U R _ Y** with a fourth letter that hasn't been excluded. The word **CURVY** (C‑U‑R‑V‑Y) fits perfectly; V has not been tested yet, and the word is valid.

Thus the next logical guess is “CURVY”.
