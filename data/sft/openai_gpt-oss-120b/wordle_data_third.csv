### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E, and it does contain an R that is not in the second position. Therefore the next guess should include an R in a different spot (positions 1,3,4,5) and should avoid the eliminated letters. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more information: “FLIRT”. This places R in the fourth position, which is permissible, and adds F, L, I, and T for testing.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N, E are not in the word; R is in the word but not position 2.
- From FLIRT: F, L are not in the word; I is correct at position 3; R is correct at position 4; T is in the word but not position 5.

Thus far we know the secret word pattern is:
1: unknown (could be T)
2: unknown (could be T if not in 1)
3: I
4: R
5: unknown (cannot be T)

The word must contain T somewhere in positions 1 or 2. All other letters used so far (C, A, N, E, F, L) are ruled out.

A valid English word fitting these constraints is **THIRD**:
- T at position 1 (satisfies T not at 5)
- H, D are not ruled out
- I at 3, R at 4 match known correct placements.

Therefore ""THIRD"" is a good next guess.
