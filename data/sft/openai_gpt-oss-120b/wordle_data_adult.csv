### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: S, E, O, M, Y.
- The word contains A, L, and at least two T’s.
- Position restrictions:
  * A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → possible positions 1 or 5.
  * L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → possible positions 1 or 4.
  * T cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → possible positions 2 or 5.

To satisfy the two‑T requirement, T must occupy positions 2 and 5.  
Then A cannot be in position 5, so A must be in position 1.  
L cannot be in position 1 (already taken by A) and cannot be in position 5, so L fits naturally in position 4.

Thus the pattern is **A T _ L T**.  
A common English word matching this pattern and using only allowed letters is **ATILT** (the missing third letter is I, which is not excluded).

Checking ATILT against all previous guesses confirms it produces exactly the observed feedback, so it is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TOTAL -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) T(-) A(-) L(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- Letters S, E, O are not in the word.
- Letters L, A, T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in previous guesses.
  * L cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
  * A cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  * T cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

Trying to place these letters while respecting the constraints, one viable arrangement is:
- Position 1: M (unknown)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: L (allowed)
- Position 4: T (allowed)
- Position 5: Y (unknown)

The word **MALTY** satisfies all known constraints and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Guess 3: MALTY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: S, E, O, M, Y.
- The word contains A, L, and at least two T’s.
- Position restrictions:
  * A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → possible positions 1 or 5.
  * L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → possible positions 1 or 4.
  * T cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → possible positions 2 or 5.

To satisfy the two‑T requirement, T must occupy positions 2 and 5.  
Then A cannot be in position 5, so A must be in position 1.  
L cannot be in position 1 (already taken by A) and cannot be in position 5, so L fits naturally in position 4.

Thus the pattern is **A T _ L T**.  
A common English word matching this pattern and using only allowed letters is **ATILT** (the missing third letter is I, which is not excluded).

Checking ATILT against all previous guesses confirms it produces exactly the observed feedback, so it is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern after feedback:

- Position 1 is confirmed as **A**.
- Position 4 is confirmed as **L**.
- Position 5 is confirmed as **T** (the only T in the word).
- Positions 2 and 3 cannot be any letters that received an “x” (S, E, O, M, Y, I) and also cannot be letters that were marked “‑” in those exact spots (no T at 2, no L at 2, no T at 3, no L at 3, etc.).

Thus we need a word of the form **A _ _ L T** using letters not yet ruled out.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **ADULT** (A‑D‑U‑L‑T), where D and U have not been excluded by any prior feedback.

Therefore the next guess should be “ADULT”.
