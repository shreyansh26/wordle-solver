Therefore the secret word must contain the letter **L**, but not at position 2. All other letters used so far are ruled out.

Allowed letters (not yet eliminated) are: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a five‑letter word using only these letters, containing L (not in the second slot). A common word that fits is **LULLY** (L U L L Y). It uses only allowed letters, places L at positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (none at position 2), and introduces U and Y for further testing.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
