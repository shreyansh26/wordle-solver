### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C and N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, with R somewhere except position 2, and A somewhere except position 3. No C or N anywhere.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **LARGE** (L A R G E):  
- Ends with E.  
- Contains A (now in position 2, not position 3).  
- Contains R (now in position 3, not position 2).  
- Introduces new letters L and G to test further.  
Thus it follows all known clues.
