### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N).

We know the secret word starts with C (position 1). The letter R, N, and E are not present anywhere. The letter A is present but not in position 3. To get more information, we should keep C in the first slot, place A somewhere other than the third position, and introduce new letters that haven't been ruled out (like V, I, L). The word “CAVIL” satisfies these constraints and gives us fresh letters to test.

We know:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, N, E, V, I are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with C that includes A and L, with A placed at position 4 or 5 (since 2 and 3 are forbidden) and L not at position 5. The word “CLOAK” fits:
C (pos1 correct), L (pos2, allowed), O (new), A (pos4, allowed), K (pos5, allowed). No forbidden letters are used.
Thus “CLOAK” is a good next guess.
