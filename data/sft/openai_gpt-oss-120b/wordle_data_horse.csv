### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).

- The letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **C, A, N, U, T** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form **_ O _ _ E** that contains **R** (in position 3 or 4) and avoids the excluded letters.  
Possible candidates include **FORGE** (F O R G E) and **GORGE** (G O R G E). Both satisfy the constraints and introduce new letters (F, G) for further testing. I’ll start with **FORGE**.

We have the confirmed pattern:
- Position 2: O (correct)
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Position 4: S (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

Thus the secret word is of the form _ O R S E.

The only common English words fitting this pattern are **HORSE** and **WORSE**. Neither H nor W has been ruled out by previous feedback. I will guess **HORSE** to test the first letter.
