### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with T, containing both L and I in allowable spots, and using only letters not excluded. 
The word **SPLIT** fits:

We have derived the following constraints from the feedback:

- Position 1: S (correct from SPLIT)
- Position 5: T (correct from LIGHT and SPLIT)
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in position 4.
- Letter I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in position 3.
- All other letters used in previous guesses (C,R,A,N,E,B,O,M,G,H,P) are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is **S _ I L T**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Letters C,R,A,N,E,B,O,M,G,H are not in the secret word.
- T is correct at position 5.
- L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it can be in positions 3 or 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 2, so it can be in positions 1,3,4.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with T, containing both L and I in allowable spots, and using only letters not excluded. 
The word **SPLIT** fits:
- Pattern: S (1) P (2) L (3) I (4) T (5)
- L is at position 3 (allowed), I is at position 4 (allowed), T is at 5 (confirmed).
- Remaining letters S and P are not among the excluded letters.
