### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All five letters from the first guess (C R A N E) are confirmed absent from the secret word. I need a new five‑letter word that contains none of those letters. Choosing a common word with completely different letters will give fresh information. “SMITH” uses S, M, I, T, H – all letters not in the excluded set, so it’s a good next guess.

We know:
- S is correct at position 1.
- M, I are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not at position 4.
- H is in the word but not at position 5.
- Letters C, R, A, N, E are also excluded.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with S, containing both T and H, respecting the positional restrictions, and using only allowed letters.

The word **SHOOT** fits:
- S is at position 1 (✓).
- H appears (position 2), satisfying “present but wrong position” for H.
- T appears (position 5), satisfying “present but wrong position” for T (not in position 4).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus SHOOT is a valid next guess.

- O is correct at position 3, and the second O (position 4) was marked x, so there is only one O in the word, at position 3.
- T is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **S H O _ T**.
