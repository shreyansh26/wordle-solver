### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters and a couple of less common ones to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter because it uses S, L, A, T, and E, which cover both vowels and frequent consonants.

We have feedback from first guess SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (the last position).

Thus the secret word must contain the letter E somewhere in positions 1–4, and must avoid S, L, A, T completely.

For the next guess we should:
1. Include E in a non‑final position.
2. Introduce new letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

A good candidate is **CRIED**:
- Contains E in position 4.
- Uses new letters C, R, I, D which are still possible.
- No prohibited letters.

Thus we guess “CRIED”.

We have the following deductions:
- From SLATE: S, L, A, T are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From CRIED: C is correct at position 1, R is correct at position 2, I is not in the word, E is in the word but not in position 4, D is in the word but not in position 5.

Since E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, it must be in position 3.  
Since D cannot be in position 5 and positions 1‑3 are already C, R, E, D must be in position 4.

Thus the word pattern is **C R E D _**.  
The only common English word fitting this pattern that uses none of the excluded letters (S, L, A, T, I) is **CREDO**.
