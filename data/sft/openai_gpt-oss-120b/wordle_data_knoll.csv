1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that the only letter known to be in the secret word is **N**, and it cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from previous feedback). Therefore N must be in position 2 or 5.

All other letters tried so far (C,R,A,E,I,G,H,T,F,U,D,S) are confirmed absent.

The remaining usable letters are: B, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid English word that places N in position 5 and uses only the allowed letters is **BLOWN** (B L O W N). This respects all constraints and introduces new letters to test.

We have determined the following constraints from the feedback:

- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 → N must be in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 2 → L can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- All other letters tried (C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T, F, U, D, S, B, W) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ N O _ _** with L occupying one of the remaining slots (1, 4, or 5).  
A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **KNOLL** (K N O L L).

This guess uses only letters not yet eliminated and places N and O correctly while testing L in a new position.
