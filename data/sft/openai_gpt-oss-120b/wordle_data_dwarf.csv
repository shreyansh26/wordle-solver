### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined from feedback:
- A is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 4 (and was previously indicated not in position 2).
- Letters C, N, E, S, H, P are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is _ _ A R _. We need a valid English 5‑letter word fitting that pattern without using the excluded letters. “QUARK” (Q‑U‑A‑R‑K) matches perfectly: A third, R fourth, and none of its letters are among the excluded ones. It’s a common word, so it’s a good next guess.

We have confirmed:
- A is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 4.
- Letters C, N, E, S, H, P, Q, U, K, L, M are not in the word.
The feedback “A(-)” on the first position of ALARM only indicates that A appears elsewhere (already satisfied by position 3), not that there is a second A. Therefore the remaining unknown letters are positions 1, 2, and 5, using any letters not excluded.

A common word fitting the pattern **_ _ A R _** without using excluded letters is **BOARD** (B O A R D).

This guess will test three new letters (B, O, D) and keep the confirmed A and R in place.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
