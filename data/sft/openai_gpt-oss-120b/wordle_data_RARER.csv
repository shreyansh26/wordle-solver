### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word includes the letters R, A, and E, but not C or N. Additionally, the positions from the first guess tell us:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that contains R, A, and E placed in different positions than those ruled out, and introduces two new letters to test. A good candidate is **EARTH**:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E is only ruled out from position 5).
- A in position 2 (A is only ruled out from position 3).

- T and H are new letters to gather more information.

Thus the next guess will be “EARTH”.

We have determined the secret word has A in position 2, R in position 3, and E in position 4. Letters eliminated so far are: C, N, T, H, B, D, F, S, and also E cannot be in position 1 (from EARTH) and cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE). The pattern is _ A R E _. We need a word fitting this pattern using letters not yet eliminated. “PARER” (P A R E R) satisfies the pattern, introduces new letters (P and R repeats are allowed) and avoids all eliminated letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback that the secret word includes the letters R, A, and E, but not C or N. Additionally, the positions from the first guess tell us:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that contains R, A, and E placed in different positions than those ruled out, and introduces two new letters to test. A good candidate is **EARTH**:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E is only ruled out from position 5).
- A in position 2 (A is only ruled out from position 3).
- R in position 3 (R is only ruled out from position 2).
- T and H are new letters to gather more information.

Thus the next guess will be “EARTH”.
