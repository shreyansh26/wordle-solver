### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE, all letters C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word. The next guess must avoid these letters entirely. Choosing a common 5‑letter word that uses only the remaining letters increases the chance of obtaining useful feedback. ""SMITH"" consists of S, M, I, T, H—none of which were ruled out—so it’s a good candidate for the second guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Letter T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, H are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Starts with S,
- Contains T somewhere other than the fourth slot,
- Avoids all excluded letters.

A good candidate is **STUDY**:
- Starts with S,
- Places T in position 2 (allowed),
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (U, D, Y are all still possible).

Thus we’ll guess “STUDY”.
