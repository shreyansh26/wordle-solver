### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- A is correct at position 3.
- C is in the word but not at position 1, so C must be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the third slot, containing a C in a different position, and avoiding R, N, E. “SCAMP” fits perfectly:
- Position 1 = S (allowed)
- Position 2 = C (C is present, not in position 1)
- Position 3 = A (matches known correct spot)
- Position 4 = M (allowed)
- Position 5 = P (allowed)
No forbidden letters appear.

Thus “SCAMP” is a good next guess.

- Guess 3 (BLACK): B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 1; L(x) eliminates L; A(✓), C(✓), K(✓) lock positions 3, 4, 5 as A‑C‑K.

Thus the secret word’s pattern is:

So the word must be of the form **? B A C K**.
