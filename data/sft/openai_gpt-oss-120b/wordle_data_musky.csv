### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From “crate”: C, R, A, T, E are all not in the word.
- From “blond”: B, L, O, N, D are all not in the word.
- From “jumpy”: 
  - J and P are not in the word.
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - Y is correct in position 5.
  - M is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word pattern is: _ U _ _ Y, with M occupying either position 1 or 4 (but not 3).  
All eliminated letters are: A, B, C, D, E, J, L, N, O, P, R, T.  

A viable word that satisfies the constraints is **MUSKY**:
- Position 1 = M (allowed, and not position 3)
- Position 2 = U (matches the ✓)
- Position 3 = S (still possible)
- Position 4 = K (still possible)
- Position 5 = Y (matches the ✓)

All letters are not among the eliminated set, so “musky” is a legal, informative guess.
