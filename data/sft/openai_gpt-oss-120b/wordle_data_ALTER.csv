### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that the secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were guessed previously.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4

Choosing placements that satisfy all constraints, one viable arrangement is:
- R in position 1
- E in position 2
- A in position 4

That yields the pattern **R E _ A _**.  
A common English word matching this pattern and introducing two new letters (L and Y) is **RELAY**.

This guess keeps the known letters in allowed positions and tests two fresh letters while avoiding letters already ruled out (C, N, T, H).

Since there is no prior information, I’ll choose a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize information. “CRANE” is a good choice because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the previous feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore the secret word must contain the letters R, A, and E, placed in positions other than those ruled out, and must avoid C and N. I’ll choose a word that includes R, A, and E in new positions and introduces two fresh letters to gather more information. “EARTH” satisfies all constraints:
- E at position 1 (allowed)
- A at position 2 (allowed)
- R at position 3 (allowed, since R can’t be at 2)
- T and H are new letters to test.
Thus, “EARTH” is a logical next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARTH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) T(-) H(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed that the secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were guessed previously.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4

Choosing placements that satisfy all constraints, one viable arrangement is:
- R in position 1
- E in position 2
- A in position 4

That yields the pattern **R E _ A _**.  
A common English word matching this pattern and introducing two new letters (L and Y) is **RELAY**.

This guess keeps the known letters in allowed positions and tests two fresh letters while avoiding letters already ruled out (C, N, T, H).

Guess 2: EARTH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) T(-) H(x)
Guess 3: RELAY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) L(-) A(-) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:

- The secret word contains the letters **R, A, E**.
- Positions ruled out:
  * R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → R must be in 4 or 5.
  * A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → A must be in 1 or 5.
  * E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 → E must be in 3 or 4.
- Letters known NOT in the word: C, N, T, H, L, Y.

A viable arrangement is:
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: a new letter  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: R  
- Position 5: a new letter  

The word **OPERA** fits all constraints (O and P are new letters, and the positions of A, E, R are allowed). It also avoids all letters that have been ruled out.

Thus the next guess is “OPERA”.

We have deduced the exact positions for the known letters:

- A cannot be in positions 2‑5, so A is in position 1.
- R cannot be in positions 1‑4, so R is in position 5.

All letters that have been marked “x” are not in the word: C, N, T, H, L, Y, O, P.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

So the secret word fits the pattern **A _ _ E R**.

The feedback from guess 5 (AMBER) shows that M and B are not in the word, and all other letters already eliminated (C, N, T, H, L, Y, O, P, M, B) are also not in the word.

Thus the remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 3 are any letters not yet ruled out, such as D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

A common English word that matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **AIDER** (A‑I‑D‑E‑R). Both I and D have not been excluded, and the word is valid.

Therefore the next guess will be “AIDER”.
