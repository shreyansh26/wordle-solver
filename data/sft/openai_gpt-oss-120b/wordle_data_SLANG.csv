### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position, while C, R, and E are not present anywhere. I need a new 5‑letter word of the form ??AN? that avoids those letters. “PLANT” fits the pattern (P L A N T) and does not contain C, R, or E, so it’s a good next guess.

We have the pattern _ L A N _. From previous feedback:
- L is correct at position 2.
- A is correct at position 3.
- N is correct at position 4.
- G is in the word but not in position 1 (feedback '-' for G at position 1), so G must be in another position, which can only be position 5 because positions 2‑4 are already filled.
- D is not in the word.

Thus the word must be ? L A N G. The only common English word fitting this pattern without using any eliminated letters (C, R, E, P, T, B, K, D) is **SLANG** (S L A N G). S has not been ruled out yet.

So the next guess should be SLANG.
