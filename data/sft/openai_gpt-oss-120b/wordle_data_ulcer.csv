### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters C, R, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.
Letters A and N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes C, R, and E, respects those position constraints, and introduces two new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **RELIC**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- C is in position 5 (allowed, since C just cannot be in position 1).
- L and I are new letters to test.

Thus we can submit “RELIC” as the next guess.
