### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a valid English word matching that pattern, using only allowed letters for positions 1‑3. Possible candidates include “SUPER”, “UPPER”, “SHEER”, etc. “SUPER” uses new letters S, U, P that have not been ruled out, fits the pattern, and is a common word.

So the next guess will be “SUPER”.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1: U (since U is in the word but not at position 2)
- Position 3: P (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)
- Position 2: still unknown, cannot be U, and must be a letter not ruled out (C, A, N, I, L, D, M, O, V, S are excluded).

The only common English word that fits the pattern **U ? P E R** with the allowed letters is **UPPER** (U‑P‑P‑E‑R). It places a second P in position 2, which is allowed because we have no information contradicting a P there.

Thus the next logical guess is:
