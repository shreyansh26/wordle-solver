### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is correct at position 2 (from FAITH and JAZZY).
- Y is correct at position 5 (from JAZZY).

Eliminated letters (not in the word) are: C, R, N, E, L, B, U, M, F, I, T, H, J, Z.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4 are from the set {D, G, K, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y (already used), A (already placed)}.

We need a word of the form _ A _ _ Y using only allowed letters. A good choice is **SAPPY**:
- S (allowed, untested)
- A (already known at position 2)
- P (allowed, untested) appears twice, giving extra info
- Y (already known at position 5)

This guess introduces new letters S and P while respecting all constraints.
