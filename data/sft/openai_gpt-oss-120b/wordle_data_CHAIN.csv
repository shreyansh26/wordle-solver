### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know the secret word has:
- C in position 1 (C ✓)
- A in position 3 (A ✓)
- N somewhere else, but not in position 4 (N -)
- R and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is **C _ A _ _**, with N in position 2 or 5.  
We need a valid word that fits the known letters and avoids R and E.  
“CHAMP” matches the pattern (C ? A ? ?), introduces new letters H, M, P, and does not contain any excluded letters. It also leaves the placement of N open for future guesses.

We have identified confirmed letters:
- Position 1: C (from CRANE)
- Position 2: H (from CHAMP)
- Position 3: A (from both guesses)
- Position 5: N (because N is in the word but was in position 4 in the first guess, so it must be elsewhere; positions 1‑3 are taken, so position 5 is the only remaining spot)

Thus the word pattern is **C H A _ N**.  
The only unknown is position 4, which cannot be M, R, E, or P (they’re ruled out). A common vowel like I fits, forming the valid English word **CHAIN**.

So the next logical guess is:
