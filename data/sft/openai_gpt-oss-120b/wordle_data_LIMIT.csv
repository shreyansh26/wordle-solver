### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a first guess that is a common 5‑letter English word. “CRANE” is a frequent choice in these types of games because it contains a mix of common consonants and a vowel, giving useful information about possible letters and placements.

The first guess “CRANE” eliminated the letters C, R, A, N, and E entirely. The next guess must avoid these letters. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word using different letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “SHOUT”, which contains S, H, O, U, and T – none of which have been ruled out yet.

We know from previous feedback that the letters C, R, A, N, E, S, H, O, U are not in the secret word. The letter T is correct and in the 5th (final) position. Therefore the secret word ends with T and must avoid all excluded letters.

We need a common 5‑letter English word ending with T using only letters not yet ruled out. The word “DIGIT” fits: D, I, G, I are all still possible, and it ends with T. This satisfies the constraints and gives new letters to test.
