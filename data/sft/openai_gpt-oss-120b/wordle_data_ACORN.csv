### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give me useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes two frequently used consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

The feedback tells me that C, R, A, and N are all in the secret word but none are in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"". The letter E is not in the word. I need a five‑letter word that contains C, R, A, N plus one other letter, with each of those four letters placed in a different position from the first guess. The word **NARCO** (N‑A‑R‑C‑O) satisfies all constraints:
- C, R, A, N are present.
- None of them are in the same spots as in ""CRANE"".
- It includes a new letter O, and no E.
Thus it’s a good second guess.

We have identified that all five letters C, R, A, N, O are in the secret word, each exactly once, with no other letters. The constraints from the two guesses are:
- C not in positions 1 or 4
- R not in positions 2 or 3
- A not in positions 3 or 2
- N not in positions 4 or 1
- O not in position 5

The word **ACORN** (A‑C‑O‑R‑N) satisfies all these constraints and is a valid English word. This makes it an optimal next guess.
