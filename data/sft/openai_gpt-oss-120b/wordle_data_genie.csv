### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, high‑information five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving good coverage of both vowels and consonants.

We have the pattern: letters 1‑4 unknown, 5 = E. Letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (feedback “-” from guess CRANE where N was fourth). Therefore N must be in positions 1‑3. We must avoid C, R, A (they are not in the word). Choose a common word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters. “LUNGE” fits: L U N G E → N is in position 3, E is correct at 5, and it uses only new letters (L, U, G) that haven’t been tried.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 3 is **N** (green from LUNGE).
- Position 5 is **E** (green from both guesses).
- Letter **G** is in the word but not in position 4 (yellow from LUNGE).
- Letters **C, R, A, L, U** are not in the word (all marked x).

We need a word that keeps N at the third slot and E at the fifth slot, includes G somewhere other than the fourth slot, and avoids the excluded letters.  
The word **GENIE** fits perfectly:
- G in position 1 (satisfies the requirement that G is present and not in position 4).
- E in positions 2 and 5 (position 5 matches the known green E).
- N in position 3 (the confirmed green).
- I is a new letter we haven’t tested yet.
All forbidden letters are avoided.

Thus the next guess should be **GENIE**.
