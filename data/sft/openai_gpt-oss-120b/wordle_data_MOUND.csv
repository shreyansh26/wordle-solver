### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The feedback tells us that the only correct letter from ""CRANE"" is N, and it's in the correct fourth position. Therefore the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N _. The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all. I need a new five‑letter word that has N as the fourth letter and avoids C, R, A, E. ""BOUND"" fits: B O U N D, with N in the fourth spot and all other letters unused so far.

We know the secret word pattern is _ O U N D with the first letter unknown. The letters B, C, R, A, E have been ruled out. Viable candidates include SOUND, HOUND, MOUND, POUND, FOUND, WOUND. We need a guess that tests a new first letter while keeping the known correct letters in place. Choosing **MOUND** introduces M, which hasn't been used yet, and keeps O U N D in their correct positions. This will tell us if the first letter is M or not.
