### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

E must appear somewhere in positions 2‑4.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Letters eliminated: R, A, N, L, F, T, plus any duplicates of those.
So the word pattern is C _ E _ _. We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters not yet ruled out. A good candidate that fits the pattern and introduces new letters is **CHESS** (C H E S S). This tests H and S, which haven’t been used yet, and respects all known constraints.

Thus the secret pattern is **C H E _ _**.

We need to determine the last two letters. To gain the most information, we should guess a word that keeps the known prefix and introduces new letters while also testing whether the fourth position might be another E (a duplicate). The word **CHEEP** does exactly that:
- Keeps C H E.
- Places a second E in position 4 to see if the word has a double‑E.
- Introduces a new letter P in position 5.

If the secret word is CHEEK, this guess will show E at position 4 correct and P incorrect, allowing us to finish with CHEEK on the next try. If the secret word is CHEWY, this guess will show both E (position 4) and P incorrect, pointing us toward the remaining possibilities. Either way, the next guess will be clear.

Therefore, the next guess is CHEEP.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
