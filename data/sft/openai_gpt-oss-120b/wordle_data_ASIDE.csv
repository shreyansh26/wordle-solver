### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). It will give us good feedback to narrow down possibilities.

We know:
- Secret word ends with E (position 5 is correct).
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that respects these clues.  
Choose a word ending with E, includes A in a different position (1, 2, or 4), and avoids C, R, N.

“ABOVE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A at position 1 (not position 3).
- Uses new letters B, O, V that haven’t been ruled out.

Thus “ABOVE” is a good next guess.
