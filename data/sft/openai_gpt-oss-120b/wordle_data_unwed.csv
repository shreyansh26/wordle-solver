### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 1: U (confirmed from UNFED)
- Position 2: N (confirmed from ENVOY and INKED)
- Position 4: E (confirmed from INKED)
- Position 5: D (confirmed from INKED)

Thus the pattern is **U N _ E D**.  
All letters marked “x” are not in the word: C, R, A, V, O, Y, I, K, F.  
The only unknown slot is position 3. It must be a letter not yet excluded and not already used (U, N, E, D).  

A common English word matching the pattern is **UNWED** (U‑N‑W‑E‑D). The letter W has not been tried and is not excluded, making this a strong candidate for the final guess.
