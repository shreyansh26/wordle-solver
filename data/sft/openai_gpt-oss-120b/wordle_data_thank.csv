### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that the secret word has A in position 3 and N in position 4, and does not contain C, R, or E at all.  
We need a new 5‑letter word of the form **??AN?** that avoids C, R, and E.  
A common word that fits is **STAND** (S‑T‑A‑N‑D). It meets the pattern and uses only letters not ruled out.

We have confirmed letters:
- A in position3, N in position4 (✓).
- C, R, E, S, D are not in the word (x).
- T is in the word but not in position2 (‑ from STAND). So T can be position1 or5.
We need a word pattern __AN_ with T somewhere (pos1 or5) and no banned letters.
Possible candidate: THANK (T at pos1, H pos2, A pos3, N pos4, K pos5). Contains required letters, avoids banned letters.
Thus make guess THANK.
