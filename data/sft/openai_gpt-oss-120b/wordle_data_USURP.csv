### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

So the next guess must include R in a different position and avoid C, A, N, E. A good candidate is **SHIRT** (S‑H‑I‑R‑T), which places R at position 4 and uses only new letters otherwise.

We have:

- S is in the word but not at position 1 (from SHIRT’s first‑letter ‘S’ gave a “-”).
- Letters C, A, N, E, H, I, T are not in the word (from previous feedback).

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ R _ with an S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Choosing a common word that fits these constraints and introduces new letters, “LOURS” works:
- L O U R S fits the pattern (R at 4, S at 5, not at 1).
- L, O, U are all letters we have not ruled out.
