### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- R is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.
- S is correct and in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the secret word has pattern: _ _ _ S _. It must contain an A somewhere other than position 2. No R, I, or E can appear.

A common word fitting this pattern is **CLASP**:
- C L A S P
- A is at position 3 (allowed).
- S is at position 4 (matches the known correct position).
- No prohibited letters appear.

So the next guess will be CLASP.

- Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)

Forbidden letters: R, I, E, C, L, P (plus any other letters marked x).  
We need a common 5‑letter word matching the pattern and using only allowed letters.

The word **BOAST** fits perfectly:

- B, O, T are not among the forbidden letters.
