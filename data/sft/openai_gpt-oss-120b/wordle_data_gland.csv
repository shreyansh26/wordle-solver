### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements to gather useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback for the first turn.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position. Letters C, R, and E are not present anywhere in the word. Therefore the pattern is __AN_. I need a common English word fitting that pattern without using C, R, or E. “SLANT” fits: S L A N T, and none of the forbidden letters appear.

Letters eliminated so far: C, R, E, S, T (all marked x).
