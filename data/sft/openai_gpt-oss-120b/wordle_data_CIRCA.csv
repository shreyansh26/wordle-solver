### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess:
- C is correct and in the first position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like C _ _ _ _. It must contain both R and A somewhere in positions 2‑5, respecting the constraints (R ≠ 2, A ≠ 3). I’ll pick a common word that fits: **CARGO**. It places A at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed), introduces new letters G and O, and avoids N and E.

Thus the pattern is C I R _ A.

We need a valid English word fitting this pattern. “CIRCA” (meaning “approximately”) matches exactly: C I R C A. It introduces C again at position 4, which is not ruled out by any prior feedback.
