### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to keep the letters A, T, E because they are in the word but were in the wrong spots in SLATE. Their positions in SLATE were: A at 3, T at 4, E at 5. Therefore:
- A cannot be at position 3.
- T cannot be at position 4.
- E cannot be at position 5.

We must avoid S and L entirely since they received “x”. Choose a word that places A, T, E in new positions and introduces two new letters to test. 

Word “PATEN” satisfies all constraints:
- P (new), A at position 2 (allowed), T at position 3 (allowed), E at position 4 (allowed), N (new).
- No S or L present.

Thus “PATEN” is a good next guess.

- Position 5: R (✓)

Position 1 is still unknown. Letters that are known NOT to be in the word are: S, L, P, N, C. We need a valid English word of the form _ A T E R using a new first letter that hasn't been ruled out.

Possible candidates include DATER, HATER, MATER, RATER, etc. To test a new letter, I’ll choose **DATER**, which introduces the letter D (not yet tried) and fits the pattern.

We have determined the exact positions of four letters:
- Position 2 = A (✓)
- Position 3 = T (✓)
- Position 4 = E (✓)
- Position 5 = R (✓)

The first letter is still unknown. Letters that have been ruled out are S, L, P, N, C, D. Any other letter can be tried, provided the word fits the pattern _ A T E R.

A common word fitting the pattern and introducing a new, untested first letter is **MATER** (M A T E R). The letter M has not been used yet, so this guess will tell us whether M is the correct first letter.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
