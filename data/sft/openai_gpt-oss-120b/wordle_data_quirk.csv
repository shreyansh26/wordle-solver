### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

So I need a 5‑letter word that includes R (not as the second letter) and avoids C, A, N, E. “RUSTY” fits: it contains R (in position 1), and the other letters U, S, T, Y are all unrestricted.

From previous feedback:
- Letters not in word: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y.
- Letter U is correct at position 2.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ U _ _ _. R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

We need a word using allowed letters (any except the excluded ones) that contains R in one of those later positions. “JUROR” fits:
- Positions: J (1), U (2) correct, R (3), O (4), R (5).
- No excluded letters appear.
- Contains R not in positions 1 or 2.
