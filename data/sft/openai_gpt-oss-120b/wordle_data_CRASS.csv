### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the first three letters are C, R, A in correct positions. The fourth letter from the guess CRACK was C and got a “-”, meaning C is in the word but not in position 4. Since C is already correct at position 1, the feedback indicates a second C somewhere else, which must be position 5 (the only remaining slot). K is not in the word. So the secret word pattern is:

1 C (✓)
2 R (✓)
3 A (✓)
4 ? (unknown, not C, N, E, K)
5 C (must be C)

We need a valid English word matching C R A _ C. The word “CRAIC” (Irish slang for fun) fits perfectly: C‑R‑A‑I‑C. The fourth letter I is unused and allowed.

Thus the next guess should be CRAIC.

- The fourth letter cannot be C (it got a “-” when placed there) and cannot be I.
- The fifth letter cannot be C (it also got a “-”) and cannot be K.

We have confirmed the first three letters are C, R, A in correct positions.
From guess 4 (CRASH) we learned that position 4 is S (✓) and H is not in the word.
Earlier feedback showed that C is only at position 1 (the “-” feedback for C at positions 4 and 5 indicated C exists elsewhere, which we already have at position 1).
Thus the pattern is C R A S _.
The remaining unknown letter cannot be N, E, K, I, H (all marked x) and cannot be C (already placed). 
A common English word fitting C R A S _ is **CRASS**.
