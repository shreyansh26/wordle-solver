### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have gathered the following constraints from feedback:

- N is definitely in the word and is correct at position 5.
- U, O, and I are all in the word but are not in the positions they appeared in the guess **QUOIN**:
   * U ≠ position 2
   * O ≠ position 3
   * I ≠ position 4 (and from earlier, I ≠ position 2)
- Therefore the remaining possible placements are:
   * I can be at positions 1 or 3
   * U can be at positions 1, 3, or 4
   * O can be at positions 1, 2, or 4
- We need a fifth letter that is not among the excluded set.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **UNION**:
- U is at position 1 (allowed)
- N is at position 2 and 5 (position 5 is the confirmed correct N; an extra N at 2 is permissible)
- I is at position 3 (allowed)
- O is at position 4 (allowed)
- No excluded letters are used.

Thus “UNION” is a valid next guess.
