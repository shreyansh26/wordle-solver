### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- O is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 4.
- Letters C, A, N, E, S, P, T are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like **_ _ O R _** with no C, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Possible words fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters include:
- WHORL (W H O R L)
- GLORY (G L O R Y)
- FJORD (F J O R D)

Choosing a word with new letters that haven’t been tested yet will give the most information. **FJORD** introduces F, J, and D, all of which are still unknown.

Thus the next guess is FJORD.

We have determined the fixed letters from feedback:
- Position 3 is O (✓ from SPORT, FJORD, GLORY).
- Position 4 is R (✓ from SPORT, FJORD, GLORY).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ from GLORY).

Thus the word pattern is **_ _ O R Y**.

All letters that have been marked absent are: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, F, J, D, G, L.  
Letters still possible for positions 1 and 2 are any not in that list and not already used.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **IVORY** (I V O R Y). Neither I nor V have been ruled out, making it a strong candidate.

Proceed with the guess IVORY.
