### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which will give useful information about the secret word.

The feedback tells us:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word.

Thus the secret word has the form __A__ with an R somewhere except position 2, and must avoid C, N, E. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **GLAIR** (G L A I R), where R is in position 5. I’ll guess that.

We know:
- Position 3 is A (✓ from both guesses).
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from “R(-)” in both guesses). So R can be position 1 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, G, L, I.
We need a 5‑letter word with A third, R at position 1 or 4, and none of the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- **ROAST** (R at 1, A at 3) – uses letters O, S, T not excluded.
- **SHARP** (R at 4, A at 3) – uses letters S, H, P not excluded.

Both satisfy all constraints, so we can test one. I’ll try **SHARP** to explore new letters H and P.
