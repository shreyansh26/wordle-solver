### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I'll choose a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter word because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E).

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N not in word; R present not in position 2; E present not in position 5.
- From LEVER: L, V not in word; E present not in positions 2 or 4; R present not in position 5.
Thus letters present: R, E. Excluded positions:
- E cannot be 2,4,5 → possible positions for E are 1 or 3.
- R cannot be 2 or 5 → possible positions for R are 1,3,4.

We need a 5‑letter word avoiding C, A, N, L, V, and placing E and R in allowed spots. The word **EXERT** satisfies:
- E at positions 1 and 3 (both allowed).
- R at position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.
It also introduces new letters X and T for more information.
