### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that covers a variety of common letters. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). It should give me useful information for the next steps.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position. Letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word matching the pattern __AN_ and avoiding C, R, E (and preferably avoiding extra A or N). “SHANK” fits: S H A N K, with A and N already correctly placed, and it uses none of the excluded letters.

We know the secret word has A in position 3, N in position 4, K in position 5 (from SHANK feedback). Positions 1 and 2 must be letters not yet eliminated (C, R, E, S, H are out). Viable words matching __ANK are BLANK and PLANK (both avoid the excluded letters). Both introduce new letters, and either could be correct. I’ll guess BLANK to test B and L.
