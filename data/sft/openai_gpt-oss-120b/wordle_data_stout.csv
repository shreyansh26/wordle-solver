### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the word-guessing game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a frequent first guess in such games because it tests for both a common vowel (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

All five letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word. I need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. Choosing a word with common letters that haven't been ruled out will give useful information. ""GHOST"" contains G, H, O, S, T, none of which have been eliminated yet, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters X → C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
- Guess 2 (GHOST):
  * G X → G not in word.
  * H X → H not in word.
  * O ✓ → O is correct at position 3.
  * S – → S is in the word but NOT at position 4.
  * T ✓ → T is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ O _ T, with the letter S present somewhere other than position 4. The only possible positions for S are 1 or 2 (position 3 is O, position 5 is T).  

Trying S in position 1 gives the pattern **S ? O ? T**. A common English word that fits is **SPOUT** (S P O U T). All its letters (S, P, O, U, T) are allowed and none conflict with previously eliminated letters.

Therefore the next guess should be SPOUT.
