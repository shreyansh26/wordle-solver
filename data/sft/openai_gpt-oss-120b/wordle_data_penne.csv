### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that:
- Position 4 is N (correct).
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- Letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word has the form ___NE, with N and E fixed in the last two slots. We need a new guess that respects these constraints and introduces fresh letters to narrow down the possibilities. “SHONE” fits: it ends in N E, uses none of the eliminated letters, and adds S, H, and O for testing.

We have determined the secret word pattern from the feedback:
- Position 2: E (✓ from BENNE)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the word is ?ENNE. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **PENNE** (the pasta shape). The letter P has not been ruled out yet, so it is a logical next guess.
