### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- None of the forbidden letters appear.

Therefore the next logical guess is “ENDUE”.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 1: **E** (✓ from ENDUE)
- Position 2: **N** (✓ from ENDUE)
- Position 4: **U** (✓ from ENDUE)
- Position 5: **E** (✓ from ENDUE)

- Position 3 cannot be **D** (marked x) and must avoid any letters previously marked x: C, R, A, I, T, G, O, M, D.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **E N _ U E**.

The only common English word that matches this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **ENSUE** (E‑N‑S‑U‑E), where the third letter **S** has not been ruled out.

Therefore the next logical guess is “ENSUE”.
