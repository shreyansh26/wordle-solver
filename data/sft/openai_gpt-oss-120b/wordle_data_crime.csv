### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common, balanced 5‑letter word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains the frequent letters C, R, A, N, E, giving a chance to locate at least one correct letter or position.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has C in position 1, R in position 2, and E in position 5. Positions 3 and 4 are still unknown, but we know A and N are not in the word at all. A good guess should keep the confirmed letters in place and try new letters for the middle slots. “CRUDE” fits the pattern C R _ _ E and introduces U and D, which we haven’t tested yet.
