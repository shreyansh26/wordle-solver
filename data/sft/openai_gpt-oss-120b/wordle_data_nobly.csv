### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From BONDS: B, D, S are not in the word; O is correct in position 2; N is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus:
- O is confirmed at position 2.
- N is in the word, and cannot be in positions 3 or 4. It can be in position 1 or 5.
- The letters C, R, A, E, B, D, S are eliminated.

We need a new guess that keeps O in the second slot, includes N in a possible remaining spot, and tests other unknown letters. Choosing a word with N at the fifth position avoids the prohibited spots and introduces fresh letters (M, L, I) that haven’t been tried yet.

The word **MOLIN** fits:
- Pattern: M O L I N (O fixed at 2, N at 5)
- None of its letters are among the eliminated set.
- It tests three new letters (M, L, I) while respecting all known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: BONDS -> FEEDBACK: B(-) O(✓) N(-) D(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From BONDS: B, D, S are not in the word; O is correct in position 2; N is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus:
- O is confirmed at position 2.
- N is in the word, and cannot be in positions 3 or 4. It can be in position 1 or 5.
- The letters C, R, A, E, B, D, S are eliminated.

We need a new guess that keeps O in the second slot, includes N in a possible remaining spot, and tests other unknown letters. Choosing a word with N at the fifth position avoids the prohibited spots and introduces fresh letters (M, L, I) that haven’t been tried yet.

The word **MOLIN** fits:
- Pattern: M O L I N (O fixed at 2, N at 5)
- None of its letters are among the eliminated set.
- It tests three new letters (M, L, I) while respecting all known constraints.

Guess 3: MOLIN -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) L(-) I(x) N(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Positions 1‑5: _ _ _ _ _
- From CRANE: C,R,A,E are not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From BONDS: O is correct in position 2; N is in the word but not in position 3.
- From MOLIN: L is in the word but not in position 3; M,I are not in the word; O remains correct in position 2; N is still not in position 5.

Combining these:

- Position 1 must be **N** (the only remaining slot for N).
- Position 2 is **O** (confirmed).
- L is present and cannot be at position 3, so it must be at position 4 or 5.
- The remaining unknown letters must be chosen from the set of letters we haven’t eliminated: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A word that satisfies all constraints and tests new letters is **NOWLY** (N‑O‑W‑L‑Y):
- N in position 1, O in position 2 (both correct).
- L is in position 4 (different from the prohibited position 3).
- W and Y are new letters to gather more information.

Thus the next guess is NOWLY.

We need a word that matches all given feedback.

From the guesses:
- N is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 → must be position 1.
- O is correct at position 2.
- L is in the word but not position 3 → position 4 works (also got ✓ at position 4).
- Y is correct at position 5.
- B is in the word (‑ in BONDS) but not at position 1 → it can occupy position 3.

Putting these together gives the pattern **N O B L Y**, which satisfies every piece of feedback.

Therefore the next guess should be:
