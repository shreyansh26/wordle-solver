### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The previous feedback tells me that the secret word does NOT contain C, A, or E. It DOES contain R and N, but those letters are NOT in the positions they had in “CRANE”: R cannot be in position 2, N cannot be in position 4. I need a new five‑letter word that includes R and N in different spots, avoids C, A, and E, and introduces new letters to test. “SHORN” fits:
- Contains R (position 4, allowed) and N (position 5, allowed).
- No C, A, or E.
- Adds the new letters S, H, O for further clues.
Thus I’ll guess “SHORN”.

- R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 → R can only be in position 1 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 4 → I can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 because N is there).

To test the remaining possibilities, a good next guess keeps N in position 2, includes I, and places R in one of its possible spots (position 5).  
The word **INKER** (I N K E R) satisfies these constraints:
- N stays in position 2.
- I is at position 1 (still possible).
- R is at position 5 (testing that spot).
- K is a new letter to gather more information (E is known to be absent, but including it does no harm).

Thus the guess will reveal whether R belongs at the end and give the status of I and K.

The feedback from the fourth guess (INKER) tells us:
- I is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 2.
- K is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 4.
- R is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word has the pattern I N _ E R. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **INFER** (with F in the third position). This also uses a new letter F, which we haven't tested yet, and aligns with all known constraints.

So the next guess should be INFER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

- I is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 2.
- E is correct in position 4.
- R is correct in position 5.
- The third letter is not F (and must be a letter not previously eliminated: C, A, S, H, O, U, G, K, F are all out).

Possible English words matching I N _ E R are limited. The common word ""INNER"" fits perfectly: it uses N again in the third position, which hasn't been ruled out, and all other letters match the known constraints. No other common word fits the pattern with allowed letters.
