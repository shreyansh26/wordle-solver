### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback:
- C and R are not in the secret word.
- A is correct in the 3rd position.
- E is correct in the 5th position.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position (it was in position 4 of the guess).

So the secret word must match the pattern: _ _ A _ E, contain the letter N (in position 1 or 2), and must not contain C or R.

A valid English word fitting these constraints is **ENATE** (E N A T E):  
- N is in position 2 (not position 4) → satisfies the “‑” feedback.  
- A is in position 3 and E in position 5, matching the ✓ marks.  
- No C or R appear.

Thus “ENATE” is a logical next guess.

We have the following feedback so far:

1. From CRANE:  
   - C and R are not in the word.  
   - A is correct at position 3.  
   - N is in the word but not at position 4.  
   - E is correct at position 5.

2. From ENATE:  
   - The first E (position 1) is present elsewhere → confirms E is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - N at position 2 is correct.  
   - A at position 3 is correct.  
   - T is not in the word.  
   - E at position 5 is correct.

So the secret word pattern is: **_ N A _ E**.  
Forbidden letters: C, R, T (and also the first‑position E).  
We need a valid English word fitting that pattern. “SNAKE” matches perfectly (S N A K E) and uses none of the excluded letters.

Thus the next logical guess is “SNAKE”.
