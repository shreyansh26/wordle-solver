### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that:
- S, L, T are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain A and E, placed elsewhere, and must avoid S, L, T. A good next guess should put A and E in new positions while introducing fresh letters to gather more info.

Choosing **CAGED**:
- A is at position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
- E is at position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 5).
- No prohibited letters (S, L, T) appear.
- New letters C, G, D allow us to test additional possibilities.

This guess will help confirm the correct spots for A and E and give information about the new letters.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ A G E R.

The letters excluded so far are S, L, T, C, D, W (all marked x). We need a valid English word that fits the pattern and uses a letter not excluded for the first position.

Possible candidates:
- PAGER (P is allowed, forms a common word)
- RAGER (uses R again, also a valid word)
- MAGER, HAGER, etc., are not standard words.

Choosing ""PAGER"" introduces a new letter (P) and tests the first position without duplicating known letters, giving us clear information about the correct first character.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""PAGER"".

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ A G E R.

Letters that have been ruled out (marked x) are: S, L, T, C, D, W, P, and also the first‑letter candidates from earlier guesses cannot be any of these. The only common English word that fits _AGER with a permissible first letter is **RAGER** (R A G E R).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Thus the secret word must contain A and E, placed elsewhere, and must avoid S, L, T. A good next guess should put A and E in new positions while introducing fresh letters to gather more info.

Choosing **CAGED**:
- A is at position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
