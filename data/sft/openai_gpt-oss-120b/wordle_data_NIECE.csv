### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, covering several common letters and vowel positions.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5). It must contain the letters C and N, but C cannot be in position 1 and N cannot be in position 4. The letters R and A are excluded. A suitable 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints is **UNCLE** (U N C L E): C is in position 3, N in position 2, and E is correctly placed at the end. No forbidden letters appear.

We know:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- Letters **C** and **N** are in the word.
  * C cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  * N cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- Excluded letters: R, A, U, L.

Thus possible placements:
- C can be in position 2 or 4.
- N can be in position 1 or 3.

A word that satisfies all constraints and uses only allowed letters is **NIECE**:
- N (pos 1) – allowed.
- I (pos 2) – not excluded.
- E (pos 3) – allowed (E is already confirmed at pos 5, but duplicates are permissible).
- C (pos 4) – allowed.
- E (pos 5) – confirmed correct.

All conditions are met, so “NIECE” is a valid next guess.
