### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the fixed positions:
- Position 2 = I (from GIANT: I was a ✓)
- Position 3 = A (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓)

So the pattern is _ I A N _. 

Letters that have been ruled out (x) are: C, R, E, S, W, K, B, L, D, G, T, plus any others from earlier guesses.  

We need a common 5‑letter word matching the pattern and using only letters not yet excluded.  
“PIANO” fits perfectly: P I A N O, with I‑A‑N in the right spots and introduces new letters P and O, which have not been tested yet.
