### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I’ll start with a common starter word that includes a mix of frequent letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” contains the consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E, which should help identify correct letters and positions early on.

From the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- E is correct in the 5th position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E, containing both R and A, with R not at slot 2 and A not at slot 3, and without C or N. “RAISE” fits perfectly:
- R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5)
- R and A are present, not in the forbidden slots.
- No C or N.

Thus the next guess is “RAISE”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓) → E is correct in position 5; R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively; C, N are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (RAISE): R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(✓) → A is correct in position 2; S is correct in position 4; E is correct in position 5; R is in the word but not in position 1; I is not in the word.

Thus the word pattern is: _ A _ S E, and it must contain the letter R (somewhere other than positions 1, 2, 4, 5). The only remaining slot for R is position 3. A common English word that fits this pattern is **PARSE**.

So the next guess is:
