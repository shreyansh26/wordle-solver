### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has R in the second position and E in the fifth position. The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all. Therefore the pattern is _ R _ _ E. I need a new guess that respects this pattern and uses new letters to gather more information. A good choice is **TRITE** (T R I T E) – it keeps R and E in the correct spots and introduces T and I, which we haven’t tested yet.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Position 4 is T (✓).
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Position 1 cannot be T (since T was marked “-” at position 1 in guess 2), and letters C, A, N, I are not in the word.
Thus the pattern is _ R _ T E.

We need a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters for position 1 and 3 to gain more information. “BRUTE” fits: B R U T E, introducing B and U, both not yet tested, and respects all known constraints.
