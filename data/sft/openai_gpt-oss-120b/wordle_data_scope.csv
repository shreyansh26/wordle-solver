### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback: C(-) means C is in the word but not first position. R, A, N are not in the word. E is correct at position 5. So the secret word ends with E, includes C somewhere in positions 2-4, and does not contain R, A, N. A good candidate fitting these constraints is ""VOICE"": V O I C E, where C is in position 4 (not first) and E is last. It also avoids the excluded letters.

We have these constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Contains C, but C is not in positions 1 or 4.
- Contains O, but O is not in position 2.
- Excludes letters R, A, N, V, I.
A word that satisfies all of these is **SCOPE**:
- Pattern: S (pos1), C (pos2), O (pos3), P (pos4), E (pos5).
- C is in position 2 (not 1 or 4), O in position 3 (not 2), ends with E.
- No prohibited letters are present.
Thus SCOPE is a valid next guess.
