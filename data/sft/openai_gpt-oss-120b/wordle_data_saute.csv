### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Current known constraints:
- Position 2 = A (confirmed from MAIZE).
- Position 5 = E (confirmed from every guess).
- Position 4 = T (confirmed from PASTE where T got a ✓).
- Letter S is in the word but not at position 3 (PASTE gave S a -). Since positions 2,4,5 are already taken, S must be at position 1.
- Remaining unknown is position 3, which must be a letter not yet eliminated: eliminated letters are C,R,N,M,I,Z,L,H,P. Possible letters include B,D,F,G,J,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y.

A common English word fitting the pattern S A _ T E is **SAUTE**, where the third letter is U, a letter not yet ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be SAUTE.
