### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from prior feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L, P, T are not in the secret word.
- The letter E is in the secret word but cannot be in positions 3 (from the second guess) or 5 (from the first guess). Thus E can only be in position 1, 2, or 4.
We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E in one of the allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.
From the remaining alphabet (B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) the word **MIXED** fits perfectly:

- All other letters (M, I, X, D) are not among the eliminated ones.

The only known letter is E, which is present but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from the three '-' feedbacks). Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a word using only the remaining letters (B, E, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z) and having E in position 1 or 2, with no other E elsewhere.

A suitable word is **BEFOG** (B E F O G): E is in position 2, and all other letters are from the allowed set.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Letter E is confirmed in the secret word and is in position 2 (E ✓ in guess 4).
- Letter T is present (T - in guess 2) but cannot be in position 5.
- All letters marked x are not in the word: C,R,A,N,S,L,P,M,I,X,D,B,F,O,G.
- Remaining possible letters are: E, T, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a 5‑letter word with E at the second position, containing T (not at position 5), and using only the allowed letters. 

“JETTY” fits perfectly:
- Pattern J E T T Y → E is at position 2.
- Contains T (positions 3 and 4), not at position 5.
- All other letters (J, Y) are from the allowed set and have not been eliminated.

Thus “JETTY” is a valid next guess.
