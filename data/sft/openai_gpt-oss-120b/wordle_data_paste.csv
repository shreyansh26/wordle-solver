### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that will give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a frequent opening guess in such word games because it includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the secret word ends with **E**, contains an **A** somewhere other than the third slot, and must avoid the letters C, R, N.

I need a new 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints and introduces fresh letters to test. “PAUSE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3).
- Uses new letters P, U, S none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it will give useful information.

We have the following confirmed positions:
- Position 1: P (✓ from PAUSE)
- Position 2: A (✓ from PAUSE)
- Position 5: E (✓ from both guesses)

Letter S is in the word but not in position 4 (feedback “S(-)” from PAUSE). The only remaining empty slots are positions 3 and 4, so S must be at position 3.

Thus the pattern is **P A S _ E**.  
We need a common 5‑letter word matching this pattern, using a letter not yet excluded (C, R, N, U are out). “PASTE” fits perfectly: P‑A‑S‑T‑E, with T as the only unknown letter.
