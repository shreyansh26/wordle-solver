We know from previous feedback that the secret word ends with ""NE"": N is correct in position 4, E correct in position 5. Letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we need a 5‑letter word of the form ___NE with none of C, R, A. Good candidates that introduce new letters are ""STONE"", ""SHONE"", ""PHONE"", etc. I’ll pick ""STONE"" to test S, T, O.
