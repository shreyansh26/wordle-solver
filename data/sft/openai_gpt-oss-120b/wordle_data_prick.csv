### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- R is correct and in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

So the secret word must have the form _ R _ _ _. The remaining letters cannot be C, A, N, or E. I’ll choose a common word fitting this pattern that uses new letters: PROUD (P R O U D). It keeps R in the second spot and introduces only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

From the feedback:
- Position 1 is P (✓).
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Letters O, U, D are not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 1; since positions 1 and 2 are already P and R, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters A, N, E are also not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with ""PR"" that contains C somewhere later and avoids the excluded letters. ""PRICK"" fits: P R I C K, with C in position 4, and uses only new letters I and K which have not been ruled out.
