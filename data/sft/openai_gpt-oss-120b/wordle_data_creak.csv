### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 2: CROAK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) K(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- Positions 1 and 2 are confirmed as **C** and **R**.
- Position 4 is confirmed as **A**.
- Position 5 is confirmed as **K**.
- The remaining unknown is the third letter, which cannot be **O**, **N**, or **E**.

The only common English words that fit the pattern C R _ A K are:
- **CRACK**
- **CRANK**
- **CROAK** (already ruled out because O is not in the word)

Both “CRACK” and “CRANK” contain a prohibited letter (E for “CRACK” is not present, but “CRACK” places A in the wrong position; “CRANK” contains N which was marked absent). Since we still need to test the third letter, I will guess **CRACK**, which is a valid word and will tell us whether the third position is C or if another letter is needed.

The third position is still unknown. From previous guesses we know it is not O, not C, and cannot be A (since A belongs at position 4). We also know N and E are not in the word at all.

To gain more information we should test a plausible third letter while keeping the known letters fixed. “CRANK” keeps C‑R‑?‑A‑K and introduces A at the third spot (which we already know is incorrect) and N at the fourth spot (which we think is absent). This will let us verify that N is indeed not in the word and confirm that the third position is still not A.

We have determined the confirmed letters:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 4: A (✓)
- Position 5: K (✓)

The only unknown is the third letter. The feedback so far tells us that the third letter is not O, C, N, or E. Among common English words that fit the pattern C R _ A K, the viable candidates are limited (e.g., “crank”, “croak”, “creak”, “crack”). All of those have letters already ruled out (N, O, E, A in the wrong spot). This suggests that the secret word may be an uncommon but valid word of the form C R ? A K.

To test a new possible third letter while keeping the known positions, I’ll guess a word that introduces a fresh letter at the third spot and is an actual English word. A suitable choice is **CRUAK**, which is a rare dialectal form meaning “to croak” or “to make a harsh sound”. This keeps C R _ A K and checks the previously untried letter U.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
