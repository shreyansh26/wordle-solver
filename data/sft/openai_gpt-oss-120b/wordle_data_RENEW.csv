### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter E is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1‑3.

We need a new word that:
1. Has E at the fourth position.
2. Contains R somewhere in the first three positions.
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A suitable word is **RUMEN**:

- No forbidden letters appear.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have deduced:
- Position 1 is R (correct from RUMEN).
- Position 4 is E (correct from CIDER and RUMEN).
- Letters S, L, A, T, C, I, D, U, M, N are not in the word.
- R is not in positions 2‑5 (already placed at 1), and E is not in position 5 (from SLATE).
Thus the pattern is **R _ _ E _**, with allowed letters for the remaining spots being B, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly another E, but not at position 5).

A word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **REGEX** (R‑E‑G‑E‑X). It keeps R and E in their known spots and tests new letters G and X.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

- Letter E is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1‑3.

We need a new word that:
1. Has E at the fourth position.
2. Contains R somewhere in the first three positions.
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A suitable word is **RUMEN**:
- R is at position 1 (testing R’s correct spot).
- U, M, and N are new letters not yet tested.
- E is correctly placed at position 4.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus this guess will confirm R’s location and test three new letters.
