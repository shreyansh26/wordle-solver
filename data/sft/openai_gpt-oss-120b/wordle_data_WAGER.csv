### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does not contain C or N. It does contain R, A, and E, but each is in a different position than in ""CRANE"": R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5. A good next guess should include R, A, and E in new positions while avoiding C and N. The word ""EARTH"" fits these constraints:
- E is at position 1 (different from position 5),
- A is at position 2 (different from position 3),
- R is at position 3 (different from position 2),
- It contains no C or N,
- It adds new letters T and H for more information.

Letters known NOT in the word: C, N, T, H, V, L.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have deduced the secret word pattern as _ A _ E R.

- Position2 is A (confirmed).
- Position4 is E (confirmed).
- Position5 is R (must be R because R cannot be in positions 1‑3 and position 4 is already E).

Letters known NOT in the word: C, N, T, H, V, L.

So we need a valid English word matching the pattern ? A ? E R with new letters in positions 1 and 3.  
Possible candidates include **Baker**, **Fader**, **Paper**, **Wager**, **Safer**, etc.  

Choosing **Baker** tests two new letters (B and K) while respecting all constraints.

Thus the next guess is:

Current known pattern: _ A _ E R  
Confirmed letters: A at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.  
Letters ruled out: C, N, T, H, V, L, B, K, (also from earlier feedback) C, N, T, H, V, L, B, K.  

We need a valid English word matching ? A ? E R with none of the excluded letters. Good candidates include **WAGER**, **PAGER**, **SAFER**, **SAGER**.  
Choosing a word that introduces two new letters will give more information, so **WAGER** (introducing W and G) is a strong next guess.
