### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, giving me useful information for the next guesses. “CRANE” is a popular opening word because it covers two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently used consonants (C, R, N). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know the secret word contains the letters R, A, N but not C or E. The feedback tells us each of these letters is in the wrong position from the first guess:
- R cannot be in position 2
- A cannot be in position 3
- N cannot be in position 4

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R, A, N placed in different positions, and adds two other letters (avoiding C and E). “RANTS” fits these constraints:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed)
- A is now in position 2 (allowed)
- N is now in position 3 (allowed)
- Adds T and S, which are new letters and not excluded.
Thus “RANTS” is a suitable next guess.
