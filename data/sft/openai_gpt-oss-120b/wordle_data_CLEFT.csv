I need to start the Wordle‑style game with a valid five‑letter word. A common opening guess that covers a variety of common letters is **CRANE**. It includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E), giving a good chance to obtain useful feedback.

The first letter must be C. The letters R, A, N are not in the word. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. I’ll choose a word that keeps C at the start, places E in the middle, and introduces new letters to gather more information. “CLEFT” fits: C L E F T, with E at position 3 and no forbidden letters.
