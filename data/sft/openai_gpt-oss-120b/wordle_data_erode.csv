We know the secret word has R in the second position and E in the fifth position (R✓, E✓). The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all. So the pattern is _ R _ _ E, avoiding C, A, N.

We have confirmed the secret word pattern: _ R O _ E (R in position 2, O in position 3, E in position 5). Eliminated letters are C, A, N, F, Z, P, B, T, V. We need a valid English word fitting the pattern with new letters for positions 1 and 4. Potential candidates are limited; “GROSE” (G R O S E) fits the pattern and uses letters G and S, which have not been eliminated. It is a legitimate word (meaning coarse).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
