### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word (x).
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).

Thus the secret word must contain N in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, and must avoid C, R, A, E entirely. I’ll choose a word that places N in a new position and introduces fresh letters to gather more information. “UNITY” has N in the second slot and uses only letters not yet ruled out (U, I, T, Y).

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From UNITY: U, I, Y are not in the word. T is correct in position 4. N is again in the word but not in position 2.

- N is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4. It can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, U, I, Y.

We need a 5‑letter word with T at the fourth slot, N somewhere else (1, 3, or 5), and using only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **DONTS**:

- Letters D, O, N, T, S are all still possible (none have been excluded).

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ O N T _.  
All letters that received an “x” are excluded: C, R, A, E, U, I, Y, D, S.  
Allowed letters for the remaining positions are any not yet excluded.

The common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **MONTH** (M‑O‑N‑T‑H). This satisfies the known placements and introduces two new letters (M and H) to be tested.

Therefore, the next guess should be “MONTH”.
