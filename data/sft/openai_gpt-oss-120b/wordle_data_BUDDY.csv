# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new five‑letter guess using only other letters. Choosing a common word with distinct letters that avoids those five gives me “MIGHT” (M‑I‑G‑H‑T). This word contains none of the excluded letters, so it’s a valid next guess.

- From MIGHT: M,I,G,H,T are not in the word.
- From BLOWS: B is correct in position 1; L,O,W,S are not in the word.

So the secret word starts with **B** and cannot contain any of the letters {C,R,A,N,E,M,I,G,H,T,L,O,W,S}. Remaining possible letters are {D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z}. We need a common 5‑letter English word beginning with B using only those remaining letters.

“BUDDY” (B U D D Y) fits: it starts with B, and uses only U, D, Y, all of which are still possible. This will test D, U, and Y while respecting all exclusions.
