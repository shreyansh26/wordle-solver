# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) and E(x): N and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain the letters C, R, and A, each somewhere other than the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"". It must not contain N or E. We need a new valid 5‑letter word that respects these constraints and helps test other letters.

A good candidate is **ACRID**:
- Contains A, C, R (all required) and places them in new positions (A 1, C 2, R 3).
- Uses new letters I and D to gather more information.
- No N or E are present.

Thus this guess satisfies all known constraints.
