### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess gave: C is in the word but not in position 1. R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.  
So the secret word must contain a C somewhere in positions 2‑5, and cannot contain R, A, N, or E.  
I’ll choose a word that places C in a new position and introduces fresh letters to test. “MUSIC” puts C at position 5 and adds M, U, S, I, none of which have been ruled out yet.

- S is in the word but not at positions 1 or 3 → can be at position 2 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 3 → can be at position 1, 2, or 5.
- All other guessed letters (R, A, N, E, M, I, T) are not in the word.
