### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

So the next guess must include R in a position other than the second, and must avoid C, A, N, E entirely. I’ll choose a word with R in the first position to be safe and use other letters that haven’t been ruled out. “RUSTY” fits these constraints.

We have the following information:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, A, N, E are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2.
- From guess 2 (RUSTY): R is correct in position 1. U, S, Y are not in the word. T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is:
- Position 1 = R
- Position 4 ≠ T
- T appears somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5)
- The letters C, A, N, E, U, S, Y are ruled out.

We need a new guess that:
- Keeps R at position 1.
- Includes T, but not at position 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A strong candidate is **RIGHT**:
- R is already fixed at position 1.
- T is placed at position 5 (allowed).
- The other letters I, G, H have not been eliminated.

Thus “RIGHT” will test the remaining unknown positions and confirm the placement of T.
