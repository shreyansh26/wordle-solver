### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains R and E in other positions, and avoids C, A, N. “RIDER” fits: it has R (positions 1 and 5, both not position 2) and E in position 4 (not position 5), and none of the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R is present but not in position 2. E is present but not in position 5.
- From RIDER: D is not in the word. R, I, and E are present but not in the positions they appeared (R not in 1 or 5, I not in 2, E not in 4).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters R, I, and E, and exclude C, A, N, D. 
Constraints on positions:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 → R must be in position 3 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses).

Trying R in position 3 works well. Then E can be in position 2 (allowed) and I can be in position 4 (allowed). The remaining letters can be any that are not excluded.

The word **MERIT** fits all constraints:
- M E R I T
- Contains R (pos 3), I (pos 4), E (pos 2).
- No prohibited letters.
- All positional restrictions are satisfied.

Thus the next guess should be “MERIT”.
