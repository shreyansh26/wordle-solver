### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it tests the common vowels A and E as well as frequent consonants C, R, and N.

From the feedback, only the letter N in position 4 is correct. All other letters (C, R, A, E) are not in the secret word at all. I need a new 5‑letter word that has N as the fourth letter and does not contain C, R, A, or E. “GLINT” fits: G L I N T, with N in the fourth spot and none of the excluded letters present.

- Position 4: N (✓)

Letters that are not in the word at all: C, R, A, E, L, T.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form G _ I N _. The only common English word fitting this pattern without using any excluded letters is **GOING** (G‑O‑I‑N‑G). It satisfies all known constraints, so we will guess it.
