### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the first guess CRANE with feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word.

So the secret word starts with C, contains R and A elsewhere, and contains neither N nor E. We need a valid 5‑letter word matching those constraints.

Consider ""CARDS"":
- Position 1 C matches.
- Position 2 A (allowed; A just can’t be in position 3).
- Position 3 R (allowed; R just can’t be in position 2).
- No N or E present.

Thus ""CARDS"" satisfies all known clues.

We have the pattern:
- Position 1 = C (confirmed).
- Position 3 = R (confirmed).
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3; it can be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters N, E, D, S are not in the word.

A valid word fitting these constraints is **CORAL**:
C O R A L
- C is position 1.
- R is position 3.
- A is position 4 (not 2 or 3).
- O and L are unused letters and are not prohibited.

Thus CORAL satisfies all previous feedback.
