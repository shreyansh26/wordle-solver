# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has R in the second position, and it does not contain the letters C, A, N, or E anywhere. The next guess should keep R in position two and introduce new letters to test more possibilities while avoiding the forbidden letters. A good candidate is “FRUIT” (F R U I T), which satisfies those constraints and adds five fresh letters for evaluation.

We have determined:
- R is correct at position 2.
- I is correct at position 3.
- M is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4 (since position 1 can’t be M for a valid English word pattern).
Thus the pattern is _ R I M _.

All letters marked “x” are not in the word: C, A, N, E, F, U, T, P, S, plus earlier X letters. Remaining unused letters include G, B, D, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **GRIMY** (G‑R‑I‑M‑Y). It uses only new letters and respects all previous feedback.

So the next guess should be “GRIMY”.
