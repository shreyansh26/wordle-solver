### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must have A at the third spot, contain R (not at spot 2) and E (not at spot 5), and must avoid C and N.  
A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **PEARL** (P‑E‑A‑R‑L): A is third, R is fourth, E is second, and it contains no C or N.

From the feedback:

- The letters C, N, P are not in the word.

A viable arrangement is **R E A L M**:
- Position 1 = R (allowed)
- Position 2 = E (fixed)
- Position 3 = A (fixed)
- Position 4 = L (allowed, not position 5)
