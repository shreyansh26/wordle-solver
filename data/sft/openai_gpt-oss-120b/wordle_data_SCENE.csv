I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular starting word that covers two common consonants and two vowels, giving good information for the next steps.

We know from the first guess:
- N is correct at position 4.
- E is correct at position 5.
- C is in the word but not at position 1.
- R and A are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ N E that includes a C somewhere in positions 2‑3 (since position 1 cannot be C) and avoids R and A. “SCONE” fits perfectly: S‑C‑O‑N‑E, with C in position 2, N and E in the correct spots, and no prohibited letters.
