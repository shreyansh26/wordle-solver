### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “SLATE” includes two frequent consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), which should give a good spread of feedback for the secret word.

We know the secret word has S in the first position and A in the third position (S _ A _ _). The letters L, T, and E are not present anywhere in the word, so we must avoid them in the remaining positions. Choose a common word fitting the pattern without using L, T, or E. “SCARF” fits: S (correct), C, A (correct), R, F — all allowed letters.
