### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that has a good mix of frequently used letters. ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word in these word‑guessing games because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has A in the third position, and cannot contain the letters C, R, N, or E. So the pattern is __A__ with the forbidden letters excluded. I’ll choose a word that respects this pattern and introduces new common letters to gather more information. “PLAID” fits: P, L, I, and D are all new letters, and the word follows the __A__ pattern without using any disallowed letters.

We have confirmed that the secret word has A in the third position (A✓). 
From the second guess, we learned that L is in the word but not in the second position (L‑). So L must be in position 1, 4, or 5. 
All letters C, R, N, E, P, I, D are excluded. 

We need a 5‑letter word matching pattern __A__ that contains L (not at position 2) and avoids the excluded letters. 
The word **SHALT** fits:
- Positions: S (1), H (2), A (3)✓, L (4) (L not in position 2), T (5)
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus SHALT will test new letters S, H, T while confirming L’s placement.
