### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving information about both consonants and a vowel.

We know the secret word contains C and R, but not in the positions they were in the first guess (C cannot be position 1, R cannot be position 2). Letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all. We should pick a new word that includes C and R in different positions and avoids A, N, E. “ROCKY” fits: R is at position 1 (different from position 2), C is at position 3 (different from position 1), and it introduces new letters O, K, Y while excluding A, N, E.

From the feedback:
- C is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters A, N, E, K, Y are not in the word.

So the secret word has pattern _ _ C _ _. It must contain O and R in positions other than those ruled out. A good fit is **MICRO** (M I C R O), where:
- C is at position 3 (✓),
- R is at position 4 (allowed),
- O is at position 5 (allowed),
- M and I are new letters that haven’t been excluded.

Thus, MICRO satisfies all known constraints.
