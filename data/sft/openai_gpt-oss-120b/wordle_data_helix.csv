### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common, high‑frequency five‑letter word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. This will give the most useful information about which letters are present and their positions. A good starter word is “CRANE” because it contains two common vowels (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). I’ll use that as my first guess.

We know from feedback that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word, while E is present but not in the 5th position. The next guess should include E in a different position (1‑4) and avoid the excluded letters. A good word that meets these criteria is “LEVEL”, which places E in positions 2 and 4 and contains only letters (L, V) not yet ruled out.

We know:
- E is definitely in position 2 (✓).
- L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (both marked “-”). So L could be in position 3 or 4 (or both).
- Letters C, R, A, N, V are not in the word.

We need a word of the form _ E _ _ _ that uses L in a new spot (position 3 or 4) and introduces new possible letters for the remaining spots while avoiding the ruled‑out letters.

“HELLO” fits:
- Position 2 = E (matches the known ✓).
- L appears in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed, and L is confirmed to be elsewhere than 1 or 5).
- The other letters H and O have not been eliminated.

Thus “HELLO” is a logical next guess.
