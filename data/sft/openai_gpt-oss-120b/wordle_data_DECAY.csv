### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters R, I, or S. It DOES contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2 (the second slot) and E cannot be in position 5 (the last slot). 

We need a new five‑letter guess that:
- Includes A and E in different positions from those forbidden.
- Excludes R, I, and S.
- Uses common letters to get useful information.

The word **GLEAM** fits:
- Contains A (in position 4) and E (in position 3), both away from the prohibited spots.
- Has no R, I, or S.
- Uses frequent letters, giving a good chance of revealing more positions.

So the next guess will be “GLEAM”.

We have confirmed:

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the fourth slot, E in slot 1 or 2, and no forbidden letters.  
A good candidate is **DECAF**:
- Pattern: D E C A F → E is in position 2, A is in position 4.
- Contains only allowed letters (D, C, F are not excluded).
Thus it satisfies all known constraints and will give new information about the remaining letters.
