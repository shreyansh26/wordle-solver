### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To start, I’ll pick a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels. “SLATE” is a good choice because it tests for S, L, A, T, and E, covering both common consonants and two vowels.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has:
- S in position 1 (correct)
- A in position 3 (correct)
- E in position 5 (correct)
- L and T are not in the word at all.
Thus the pattern is S _ A _ E, with the blanks needing letters other than L or T. A common word that fits this pattern is **SNARE** (S N A R E). It introduces new letters N and R for testing and respects all known constraints.
