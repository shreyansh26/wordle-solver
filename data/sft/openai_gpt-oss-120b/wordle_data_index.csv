### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, U, M, T, plus also the letters that got an 'x' in previous guesses: U, M, T, C, R, A.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ N _ E _. We need to fill positions 1,3,5 with letters not yet ruled out. Choose common letters that haven’t been eliminated. “INKED” matches the pattern:

  - K is not in the word.

  - D is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: I N _ E _ with D somewhere other than position 5. Therefore D must be in position 3, giving I N D E _.

We now need a common 5‑letter English word that fits **INDE_**. The obvious choice is **INDEX**, which places a new letter X in the final position and introduces no letters that have been ruled out.
