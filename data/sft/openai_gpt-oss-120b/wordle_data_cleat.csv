### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the secret word starts with **C**, does not contain R, N, or E, and contains an A somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Choose a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Places A at position 2 (to avoid the forbidden position 3).

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have:
- C is correct at position 1.
- R, N, E, V, I are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (it was in position 3 in guess 1 and position 2 in guess 2).
- L is in the word but not at position 5 (it was in position 5 in guess 2).

So the secret word starts with **C**, includes **A** (positions 4 or 5) and **L** (positions 2‑4, but not 5). All other letters must avoid the banned set {R,N,E,V,I}.

A suitable word that satisfies these constraints is **CLOAK**:
- C (✓) at position 1.
- L at position 2 (allowed).
- O is a new letter to test.
- A at position 4 (allowed for A).
- K is a new letter to test.

This keeps the known letters in permissible spots and introduces two fresh letters (O, K) for more information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C is correct in position 1.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with **C**, does not contain R, N, or E, and contains an A somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Choose a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Places A at position 2 (to avoid the forbidden position 3).
- Introduces new letters to test.
