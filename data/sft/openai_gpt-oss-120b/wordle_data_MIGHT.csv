### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess, I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word with a mix of frequently used letters to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E).

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
- From guess 2 (GLOOM): G is in the word but not in position 1; L, O are absent; M is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain **G** and **M**, with G ≠ position 1 and M ≠ position 5. All other letters must avoid the excluded set {C,R,A,N,E,L,O}.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes G and M in new positions and fills the remaining three slots with allowed letters. “MIGHT” fits:
- Contains M (position 1, not 5) and G (position 3, not 1).
- Uses I, H, T, none of which are excluded.
Therefore “MIGHT” is a valid next guess.
