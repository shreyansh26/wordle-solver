### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain the letters R, A, and E, each in a different position from those ruled out, and must avoid C and N. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **EARTH**:
- E is placed at position 1 (allowed, since only position 5 is disallowed).
- A is at position 2 (allowed, since only position 3 is disallowed).
- R is at position 3 (allowed, since only position 2 is disallowed).
- T and H are new letters that could be correct or not.
