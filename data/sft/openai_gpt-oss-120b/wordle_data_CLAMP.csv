2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- I is not in the word (x)

Thus the secret word is C L A M _. The fifth letter must be a letter not yet ruled out (cannot be R, N, E, S, H, I). A common word fitting this pattern is **CLAMP**, introducing P as a new candidate letter.
