### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know:
- Secret word ends with E (E is correct at position 5).
- Letters C, A, N are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed: C not position 1, A not position 3, N not position 4.
- R is not in the word.
We need a five‑letter word ending with E that includes C, A, N in other positions. “LANCE” fits: L A N C E. Here A is in position 2 (not 3), N in position 3 (not 4), C in position 4 (not 1), and E is correct at 5. No R present. This is a valid candidate.

From the feedback:
- Positions 2-5 are fixed as A N C E.
- Position 1 is still unknown. Letters ruled out for position 1 are L and R (from previous guesses), and it cannot be any of the already placed letters A, N, C, E.
- The pattern is _ A N C E, which matches common English words like ""DANCE"".
- D has not been eliminated, so ""DANCE"" is a valid next guess.
