### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the previous feedback:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word must contain at least one E, placed somewhere in positions 1‑4, and must avoid C, R, A, N entirely. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters for more information.

""embed"" fits: it contains E (twice) in positions 1 and 4, and uses only letters (E, M, B, D) that haven’t been ruled out.

We have feedback:
- From guess 1 (crane): C,R,A,N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (embed): 
  - Position 1 E → “-” meaning E is in the word but wrong position.
  - Position 2 M → “-” meaning M is in the word but wrong position.
  - Position 3 B → “x” meaning B is not in the word.
  - Position 4 E → “✓” meaning E is correct at position 4.
  - Position 5 D → “x” meaning D is not in the word.

Thus we know:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ E _
- The letter **E** appears at position 4 (and not elsewhere).
- The letter **M** is in the word but cannot be in position 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, D.
- Remaining unknown letters must be chosen from the rest of the alphabet.

We need a new guess that places M in a possible slot (1,3, or 5) and introduces fresh letters to gain more info while respecting the known pattern.

Word **MIXES** fits:
- Position 1 M (allowed, M not in position 2)
- Position 2 I (new)
- Position 3 X (new)
- Position 4 E (matches known ✓)
- Position 5 S (new)

All letters are allowed and no banned letters are used.

So the next guess will be “mixes”.
