### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to give useful information. “CRANE” is a frequent starter in word‑guessing games because it includes three common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should help reveal which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know C is correct in the first position. R is in the word but not in the second position. A, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word that starts with C, includes an R somewhere other than the second spot, and avoids A, N, E. “CHIRP” fits: C‑H‑I‑R‑P, with R in the fourth position and no prohibited letters.

We have the following confirmed letters and positions:

- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: unknown; cannot be I (I was marked x) and cannot be A, N, E, P (all marked x).
- Position 4: R (✓)
- Position 5: unknown; cannot be P (x) and cannot be A, N, E, I.

So the pattern is **C H _ R _**. We need a common English word fitting this pattern using letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates include:
- **CHORD** (C‑H‑O‑R‑D) – O and D have not been eliminated.
- **CHURL** (C‑H‑U‑R‑L) – U and L are also still possible.

Both are valid, but “CHORD” uses very common letters and is a straightforward guess to test the remaining slots.

Thus I will guess **CHORD**.
