### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- S, A, T are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the next guess must contain L and E in new positions, avoid S, A, T, and include three other possible letters. “LEMON” places L at position 1 and E at position 2, satisfying the position constraints, and adds M, O, N as new letters to test.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- L is at position 3,
- E is at position 4 (matches known correct placement),
- D is new.

This respects all constraints, so we will guess RILED.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:

- The secret word has **E** at position 4 (from EXPEL).
- **L** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5, so it must be at position 3.
- **I** is correct at position 2 (from RILED).
- Therefore the pattern is: _ I L E _.

Letters that are not in the word (based on X feedback) are: S, A, T, M, O, N, X, P, R, D, and we also know L is not at position 5 and E is not at positions 1 or 5.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern ? I L E ?. Looking through common words, **WILEY** fits:
- Position 1 = W (allowed)
- Position 2 = I (confirmed)
- Position 3 = L (confirmed)
- Position 4 = E (confirmed)
- Position 5 = Y (allowed)

Thus “WILEY” satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (W, Y) for further testing.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the pattern from previous feedback:

- Positions 2,3,4 are I, L, E respectively (confirmed by RILED and WILEY).
- Letter L cannot be in positions 1,2,5 and is already fixed at position 3.
- Letter E is fixed at position 4 and cannot be in positions 1,2,5.
- Letter I is fixed at position 2.
- Letter R is known to be in the word (R got a “-” at position 1 in RILED), but it cannot be at position 1, so the only remaining open slot is position 5. Hence the word ends with **R**.

Thus the secret word must be of form **_ I L E R**.

Possible common English words matching this pattern are:
- **FILER**
- **VILER**

Both satisfy all constraints and use only letters not yet eliminated. “FILER” is the more common of the two, so we choose it for the final guess.
