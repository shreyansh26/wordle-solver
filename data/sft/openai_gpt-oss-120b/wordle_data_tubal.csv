### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter in ""CRANE"").

Therefore the next guess must include A somewhere other than the 3rd slot, and must avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll choose a word that introduces new letters while satisfying these constraints.

""BALMY"" meets the criteria:
- Contains A in the 2nd position (not the 3rd).
- Uses letters B, L, M, Y which we haven’t tested yet.

We know from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, M, Y.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: A, B, L.
Constraints on positions:
- A is not in positions 3 (from CRANE) nor 2 (from BALMY), so possible positions are 1,4,5.
- B is not in position 1 (from BALMY), so possible positions are 2,3,4,5.
- L is not in position 3 (from BALMY), so possible positions are 1,2,4,5.
We need a real 5‑letter English word containing A, B, L, respecting those position restrictions, and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
The word **ALIBI** fits:
- Contains A, L, B.

- Uses only letters A, L, I, B; none of which have been excluded.

- From ALIBI: A, L, B are still in the word but not in the positions they occupied in that guess (A not 1, L not 2, B not 4). I is not in the word.

Combining all restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1,2,3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
