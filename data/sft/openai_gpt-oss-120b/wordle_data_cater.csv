### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R≠2, A≠3, E≠5).
- N is not in the word.

So the secret word starts with C, and must contain R, A, and E in other positions.  
A good candidate that respects these constraints and uses common letters is **CAVER**:
- C is kept in position 1.
- A moves to position 2 (allowed).
- R moves to position 5 (allowed).
- E moves to position 4 (allowed).
- V is a new letter to test other possibilities.

Thus I will guess ""CAVER"".
