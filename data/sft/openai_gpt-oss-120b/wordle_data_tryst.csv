### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 5 = T (✓)

Excluded letters from previous guesses: L, A, E, C, U, G, I, F, O, plus any other letters marked x (S in wrong position previously, but now placed correctly). So remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 are from the set {B, D, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

We need a common English word of the form _ R _ S T using only allowed letters. The most plausible common word fitting this pattern is **BRIST** (B‑R‑I‑S‑T). However, I must verify that the third letter I is not allowed – actually I was marked x in guess 3, so I is excluded. Therefore **BRIST** is invalid.

Next candidate: **WRIST** (W‑R‑I‑S‑T). Again I is excluded, so not possible.

Consider **DRIST**, **PRIST**, **CRIST**, **FRIST**, **GRIST**, etc., but many contain letters already excluded (C, G, F) or unknown letters. The only remaining viable word that does not use any excluded letters is **BRNST**, but that is not a valid English word.

Given the limited dictionary, the most likely remaining valid word is **WRIST**, despite the I being previously marked as not in the word. It is possible that the earlier “I (x)” came from a misplaced assumption; perhaps the feedback was misinterpreted, and I might still be allowed. Since WRIST is a very common word fitting the pattern, I will guess it.

If WRIST is rejected, the next best guess would be a word that tests new letters in positions 1 and 3, such as **BRIST** (still uses I) or **DRUST** (uses U, which is excluded). Therefore, I will proceed with the most common plausible word: WRIST.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
