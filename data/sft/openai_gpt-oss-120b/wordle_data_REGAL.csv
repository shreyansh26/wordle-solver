### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 2: PALEO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) L(-) E(-) O(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters A, L, E are in the secret word but not in certain positions:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and PALEO). So A can be 1,4,5.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3. So L can be 1,4,5.
- E cannot be in position 5. So E can be 1,2,3,4.

Excluded letters (not in the word): S, T, P, O.

We need a 5‑letter word using A, L, E in allowed slots and two new letters not among the excluded set.  
The word **IDEAL** satisfies all constraints:
- I (new), D (new) are not excluded.
- I D E A L positions: I1, D2, E3, A4, L5.
- A is at position 4 (allowed), L at position 5 (allowed), E at position 3 (allowed).
Thus IDEAL is a valid next guess.

We have determined the exact positions of four letters:
- R is correct in position 1 (✓ from RENAL).
- E is correct in position 2 (✓ from RENAL).
- A is correct in position 4 (✓ from IDEAL and RENAL).
- L is correct in position 5 (✓ from IDEAL and RENAL).

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **R E _ A L**.  
The only unknown is the third letter. It cannot be N (marked x), and it must not be any of the previously eliminated letters (I, D, P, O, S, T, N).  

A common English word that fits this pattern is **REGAL** (R‑E‑G‑A‑L), with G not yet used and not excluded. This is a valid next guess.
