### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is correct in the 3rd position.
- E is correct in the 5th position.

So the word pattern is __A_E, using letters that are not C, R, or N. A common word that fits is ""SHAVE"".
