### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it uses frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful feedback for future guesses.

We know:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 4, so N must be in positions 1‑3.
- C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending with E, containing N in positions 1‑3, and avoiding C, R, A. “LUNGE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- N is in position 3.
- Uses letters L, U, G which have not been ruled out.
Thus, “LUNGE” is a valid next guess.

We have E confirmed at position 5.  
Letters N and U are both in the word:  
- N is not in positions 4 (from CRANE) or 3 (from LUNGE), so N can be in position 1 or 2.  
- U is not in position 2 (from LUNGE), so U can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  

All eliminated letters: C, R, A, L, G (and also any repeats of those).  

A word that satisfies these constraints and ends with E is **UNITE**:
- U at position 1 (allowed, not position 2)  
- N at position 2 (allowed, not position 3 or 4)  
- I, T are new letters not yet ruled out  
- E at position 5 (confirmed)  

Thus UNITE is a valid next guess.
