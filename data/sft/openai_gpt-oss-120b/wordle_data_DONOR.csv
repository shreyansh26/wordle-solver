### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that will give useful information about vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains two common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N). I'll guess that.

We have feedback from the first guess CRANE: C is not in the word, R is in the word but not in position 2, A is not in the word, N is in the word but not in position 4, and E is not in the word.  

Thus the secret word must contain the letters R and N, with R somewhere other than the 2nd slot and N somewhere other than the 4th slot. It cannot contain C, A, or E.  

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the forbidden letters.  

The word **RUNTS** meets all constraints:
- Contains R (position 1, allowed) and N (position 3, allowed).
- No C, A, or E.
- The other letters (U, T, S) are common and give new information.

So the next guess will be “RUNTS”.

From the feedback:
- N is correct in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (and also not position 1 from second guess). So R can be in position 4 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: C, A, E, U, T, S.
We need a 5‑letter word with N third, containing R (in position 4 or 5), and none of the forbidden letters.

The word **DONOR** fits:
- Pattern D O N O R → N is third.
- R is fifth (allowed).
- No letters C, A, E, U, T, S appear.
Thus it satisfies all known constraints and will give new information about the remaining letters.
