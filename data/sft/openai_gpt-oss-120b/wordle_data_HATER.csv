### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to give me useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it contains the vowel “A” and the common consonants C, R, and N, plus the vowel “E”. This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

The feedback tells us:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position from guess 1 (CRANE):
  * R is not in position 2.
  * A is not in position 3.
  * E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, avoids C and N, and uses other letters to probe. “EARTH” contains E, A, and R in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively, which satisfies the constraints (none of those letters are in the forbidden positions). It also introduces T and H to test new letters.

Thus the next guess will be EARTH.

We have letters confirmed: A is correct at position 2. The letters R, E, T, H are all present but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.

Constraints:
- R not in positions 2 or 3.
- E not in positions 1 or 5.
- T not in position 4.
- H not in position 5.
- Position 2 is A.

Placing E at position 4 satisfies its constraints. Then we need to place R, T, H in positions 1,3,5 while respecting their individual restrictions. The arrangement H‑A‑T‑E‑R satisfies all:

1 H (allowed), 2 A (✓), 3 T (T not in position 4), 4 E (E not in 1 or 5), 5 R (R not in 2 or 3, and not prohibited at 5).

“HATER” is a valid English word, so it makes a good next guess.
