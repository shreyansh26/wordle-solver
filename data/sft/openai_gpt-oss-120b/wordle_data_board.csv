### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. Since there is no information yet, I will pick a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of commonly used letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter word because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, covering several frequent letters and vowel positions.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word.

So the secret word must be of the form __A__ with an R somewhere other than position 2, and must avoid the letters C, N, and E.

A good candidate that fits all these constraints is **SHARD** (S H A R D):
- A is in position 3.
- R appears in position 4 (not position 2).
- No forbidden letters (C, N, E) are present.

Thus the next guess will be SHARD.

We have determined the secret word pattern is __ARD with A at position 3, R at 4, D at 5. Letters C, N, E, S, H are ruled out. Possible candidates include GUARD, BOARD, YARD? (needs two letters). BOARD fits and uses only allowed letters (B, O). We'll guess BOARD.
