### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have gathered the following information from previous guesses:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) – confirmed by both guesses.
- The letter **R** is in the word but is not in position 2 (from “crate”) and not in position 4 (from “spore”). Therefore R can only be in position 1 or position 3.
- Letters **C, A, T, S, P, O** are not present anywhere in the word.

We now need a new guess that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Places **R** in a possible position (1 or 3) to test which is correct.
3. Introduces new letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Choosing **R** at position 1 seems sensible, and we can fill the remaining slots with fresh, common letters. The word **RHYME** fits all constraints:
- Pattern **R _ _ _ E** (R in position 1, E in position 5).
- Uses new letters **H, Y, M**, none of which have been tried yet.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will tell us whether R belongs in position 1 and will test the presence of H, Y, and M.

Guess 2: spore -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have gathered the following information from previous guesses:

- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5) – confirmed by both guesses.
- The letter **R** is in the word but is not in position 2 (from “crate”) and not in position 4 (from “spore”). Therefore R can only be in position 1 or position 3.
- Letters **C, A, T, S, P, O** are not present anywhere in the word.

We now need a new guess that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Places **R** in a possible position (1 or 3) to test which is correct.
3. Introduces new letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Choosing **R** at position 1 seems sensible, and we can fill the remaining slots with fresh, common letters. The word **RHYME** fits all constraints:
- Pattern **R _ _ _ E** (R in position 1, E in position 5).
- Uses new letters **H, Y, M**, none of which have been tried yet.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will tell us whether R belongs in position 1 and will test the presence of H, Y, and M.

We have determined the following constraints from prior feedback:

- The word ends with **E** (position 5) – confirmed.
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4, so it must be at position 3.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word at any position): C, A, T, S, P, O, H, Y, M, N, V.
- Position 2 cannot be **E** (since the second E in “nerve” got a “-”), and cannot be R, P, Y, etc.
- The word contains only one known E at position 5 (there could be another E elsewhere, but we have no evidence for that yet).

Thus the pattern is **_ _ R _ E**, with R fixed at the third slot and E fixed at the fifth.

We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting this pattern that uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
The word **DIRGE** fits perfectly:
- D I R G E → R is in position 3, E is in position 5.
- Letters D, I, G have not been tried and are not ruled out.

Choosing “DIRGE” will test new letters and confirm the pattern.
