### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter I is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (I ✓).
- Letter G is in the word and correctly placed at position 3 (G ✓).
- Letter T is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (T ✓).

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ I G _ T.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 must not be any of the eliminated letters. Viable candidates include B, D, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, etc. The common word “BIGOT” fits the pattern (B I G O T) and uses only allowed letters. It will test two new letters (B and O) while respecting the known placements.

So the next guess should be “BIGOT”.
