### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good candidate is **TOILS**:
- T in position 1 (allowed for T).
- O is a new letter not yet ruled out.
- I is fixed at position 3.
- L in position 4 (allowed for L).
- S is another new letter.

This word respects all constraints and introduces two fresh letters (O and S) to gather more information.

We have deduced the following constraints:
- I is confirmed at position 3.
- L is confirmed at position 4.
- T is present and cannot be in positions 1,4,5, so it must be at position 2.
- S is present but cannot be in position 5, leaving position 1 as the only possibility.
- All other letters used so far (C,R,A,N,E,G,H,B,Z,O) are excluded.

Thus the word pattern is **S T I L _**. The remaining unknown letter must be one not yet ruled out; a common choice is another **L**, giving the word **STILL**.

This fits all constraints and uses only allowed letters.
