### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle game with a common, balanced word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get good information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter word because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give a broad base for feedback on which letters are present and their positions.

We have the following feedback so far:
- N is correct and in the 4th position.
- Letters C, R, A, E, M, O, U, T, S, G, L are not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N _. The only known letter placements are:
- Position 4 = N
- Position 3 ≠ I
- Position 1,2,5 are unknown, but must include I somewhere (positions 1,2, or 5) and cannot use any eliminated letters.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that satisfies these constraints.  
Considering the remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and the requirement that the word contain I (not in position 3) and N in position 4, the word **NINNY** fits perfectly:
- N I N N Y → N is in position 4,
- I is in position 2 (not position 3),
- No eliminated letters are used.

Therefore the next logical guess is “NINNY”.
