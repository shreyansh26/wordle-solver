### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but not in the third position. For the next guess, I should choose a word that:
- Excludes C, R, N, E.
- Includes A in a position other than the third.
- Introduces new letters to test possibilities.

The word “BALMY” fits these criteria: it contains A in the second position, avoids the disallowed letters, and adds B, L, M, Y as new candidates.

The remaining usable letters are: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A).

We need a common 5‑letter English word that uses only these letters and places A at the first or last slot. The word **THUJA** (a type of coniferous tree) fits perfectly:

We have determined that the only confirmed letter is A, which must be in position 1 (all other positions have been ruled out). All letters that received an “x” are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, L, M, Y, S, O, D, T, H, U, J.  

The remaining possible letters are: F, G, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

We need a common 5‑letter English word starting with A and using only these remaining letters. The word **AFFIX** (A F F I X) satisfies all constraints and introduces several new letters for further testing.
