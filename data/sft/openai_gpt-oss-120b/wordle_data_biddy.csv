### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, T are NOT in the secret word.
- The letter I is correct and in the correct position at slot 2 (second letter).

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ I _ _ _. Remaining possible letters are those not excluded: B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly repeats of I). We need a common word fitting the pattern and using only allowed letters.

""LIVID"" fits: L I V I D
- Uses allowed letters L, V, D (and repeats I, which we know is present).
- Provides new letters L, V, D to test positions 1,3,5 and also tests if a second I occurs at position 4.

Thus ""LIVID"" is a good next guess.

- From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From MIGHT: M,G,H,T are not in the word; I is correct in position 2.
- From LIVID: L and V are not in the word; I at position 2 is correct; the second I got “-”, meaning I appears elsewhere (could be same I, but we already have it). D got “-”, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus:
- Fixed: second letter is I.
- D is somewhere in the word, but NOT at position 5.
- Excluded letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,T,L,V.
- Allowed letters to try: B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I which we already have).

We need a common 5‑letter word pattern _ I _ _ _. Including D (not at the last spot) and using only allowed letters. ""WIDOW"" fits perfectly:
- Pattern: W I D O W
- Contains D (position 3, not last) and introduces new letters W and O.
- All letters are allowed.

So the next guess will be ""WIDOW"".

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (MIGHT): M, G, H, T are not in the word; I is correct at position 2.
- Guess 3 (LIVID): L, V are not in the word; I at position 2 is correct; the second I is present elsewhere (‑); D is present elsewhere (‑).
- Guess 4 (WIDOW): W, O are not in the word; I at position 2 and D at position 3 are correct.

Thus we know the secret word pattern is **_ I D _ _** and the letters C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,T,L,V,W,O are ruled out.  
We need a common five‑letter word using only the remaining letters (B, F, J, K, P, Q, S, U, X, Y, Z) together with the confirmed I and D.

A good candidate that fits the pattern and introduces only unused letters is **BIDDY** (B I D D Y).  
- Position 2 = I (✓)  
- Position 3 = D (✓)  
- All other letters (B, D, Y) have not been excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be **BIDDY**.
