### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the exact positions from feedback:
- Position 2 = L (✓)
- Position 3 = A (✓)
- Position 4 = S (✓)
- Position 5 = H (✓)
- Position 1 is still unknown, but letters C, R, N, E, G, F, P are ruled out (marked x). 

The word pattern is _ L A S H. The common English word that fits this pattern and does not use any excluded letters is **SLASH** (S L A S H). This also tests whether S can also appear in position 1, which is still unknown.

Thus the next guess should be ""SLASH"".
