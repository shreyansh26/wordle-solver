### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich starter word to get information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” contains three different common letters (C, R, N) and the two most frequent vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

Given the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
2. Contains the letter E, placed somewhere other than the 5th spot.

Choosing “BEGOT”:
- Letters: B, E, G, O, T – none are excluded.
- E is in position 2, satisfying the requirement that it’s not in position 5.

Thus “BEGOT” is a valid next guess.

We know from prior feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, G, O are not in the secret word.
- E is correct at position 2.
- T is correct at position 5.
Thus the word pattern is _ E _ _ T, using only letters not ruled out.
We need a 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern and avoiding the excluded letters. 
“HEIST” satisfies: H (allowed) E (position2, correct) I (allowed) S (allowed) T (position5, correct). No forbidden letters appear.
Hence “HEIST” is a good next guess.
