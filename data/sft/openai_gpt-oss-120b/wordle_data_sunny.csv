### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter word. I'll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes C, R, A, N, and E.

We know from the first guess that N is correct at position 4, and the letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all. So the secret word must have N in the fourth slot and must avoid C, R, A, E entirely. I need a common 5‑letter word fitting the pattern ___N_ with no prohibited letters. “SOUND” (S‑O‑U‑N‑D) meets these criteria: N is fourth, and the other letters (S, O, U, D) are not any of the excluded letters.

Current constraints:
- Position 1 = S (✓ from SOUND)
- Position 4 = N (✓ from both guesses)
- Letter U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (‑ from SOUND), so U must be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, O, D, plus any letters already proven absent.
- Remaining positions (2,3,5) must avoid those excluded letters.

A common word fitting these constraints is **SUNNY**:
- S at position 1 (matches ✓)
- U at position 2 (U is present and not at position 3, satisfies the “‑” clue)
- N at position 3 (allowed; we only know N is correct at position 4, it may appear elsewhere)
- N at position 4 (✓)
- Y at position 5 (new letter, not excluded)

Thus “SUNNY” respects all known feedback and will give us more information.
