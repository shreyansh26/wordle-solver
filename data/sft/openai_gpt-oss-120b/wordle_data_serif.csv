### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have these confirmed facts from feedback:

- Position 2 is **E** (green from MERRY and BERGS).
- Position 3 is **R** (green from MERRY and BERGS).
- Letter **S** is in the word but not in position 5 (dash from BERGS). It could be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, U, L, M, Y, B, G.
- Positions that cannot contain R: 1, 2, 4, 5 (from earlier dashes). So R is fixed at position 3.
- Positions that cannot contain E: 4, 5 (dash from CRANE and RULER). So E stays at position 2.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ E R _ _**, with an **S** somewhere (pos 1 or 4) and the remaining two letters not among the excluded set.

A good candidate that respects all constraints and introduces two new letters (V and O) is **SERVO**:
- S at position 1 (allowed),
- E at position 2 (confirmed),
- R at position 3 (confirmed),
- V at position 4 (new, not excluded),

This guess will test the location of S and give information about V and O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain the letters R and E, with R not at the second spot and E not at the fifth spot. All other letters (C, A, N) are ruled out.

For the second guess I’ll keep R and E in new positions and introduce new common letters to gather more information. A good candidate is “RULER”: it places R at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed), while adding U and L for testing.

We have confirmed letters:

Letters ruled out: C, A, N, U, L, M, Y, B, G, V, O (and also any duplicates of those).

S was previously indicated as present but not at position 5 (from BERGS), which is satisfied with S at position 1.

The remaining unknown positions are 4 and 5. There is no evidence that a second R is required; the earlier “-” for the extra R could be satisfied by the single R we already have at position 3. Therefore we just need any letters not yet excluded.

Choosing a common word that fits the pattern **S E R _ _** and uses new letters gives us a good test. “SERIF” fits:
- S E R I F matches the known letters.
- I and F have not been tested yet.
- No conflicts with previous exclusions.
