### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess of a common 5‑letter English word. A good starter word contains a mix of frequent letters and vowels to maximize information. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, “AUDIO”, or “ROAST” are typical. I’ll choose “CRANE” because it includes the common consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving a balanced sample.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is correct and in the first position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word must start with **C**, contain **R** and **N** elsewhere, and must not contain A or E.  
A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **CHURN**:
- C is in position 1 (matches the confirmed C).
- R is in position 4 (not position 2, so it satisfies the “wrong position” clue).
- N is in position 5 (not position 4, satisfying its clue).
- No A or E appear.

Thus, CHURN is a valid next guess.
