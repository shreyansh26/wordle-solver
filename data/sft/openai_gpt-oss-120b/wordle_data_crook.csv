### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

This will tell us whether any of those letters belong in the remaining positions.

We have confirmed the first three letters and the last letter:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: guessed C gave a “-”, meaning the letter C is in the word but not here; since C is already correctly placed at position 1, the secret contains only that C.
- Position 5: K (✓)

Thus the pattern is **C R O _ K**.  
The only common English word fitting this pattern is **CROOK** (with an extra O in position 4). All other letters tested (A, N, E, I, S, P, U, F, T) are known not to be in the word, and CROOK uses only the allowed letters C, R, O, K.

So the next logical guess is CROOK.
