### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters, so the feedback will give useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter: it contains a mix of consonants and vowels and covers frequent letters.

The feedback from the first guess (CRANE) tells me:
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the next guess should include the letters A and R, placed in positions other than those ruled out, and avoid C, N, and E. A good candidate is **RAILS** (R in position 1, A in position 2, and new letters I, L, S that haven’t been tested yet).

We have:
- R is correct at position 1.
- A is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- L is in the word but not at position 4 → possible positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, I, S.
We need a word starting with R, containing A and L with the above positional limits, using only allowed letters.

The word **RURAL** fits:
- R at position 1 (✓).
- A at position 4 (allowed).
- L at position 5 (not position 4).
- No forbidden letters are present.

Thus the next guess is RURAL.
