### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, S are not in the secret word.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes O and T in different positions from those excluded, and uses only letters not ruled out.  
The word **MOTTO** fits:
- Contains O (positions 2 and 5) – neither is position 3.
- Contains T (positions 3 and 4) – neither is position 5.
- Uses only letters M, O, T, all of which are still possible.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word contains the letters **T** and **O**.
- Position 3 is a confirmed **T** (green) and position 5 is a confirmed **O** (green).
- An extra **T** is present elsewhere (the T in position 4 of MOTTO and DITTO showed a yellow), but it cannot be in position 4.
- An extra **O** is present elsewhere (the O in position 2 of MOTTO was yellow), but it cannot be in position 2.
- The letter **D** is present somewhere (yellow from DITTO) but not in position 1.
- All letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, S, M, I are ruled out.

A good next guess should keep the known correct letters (T at 3, O at 5) and test the remaining possibilities, especially the location of the second T, the second O, and the required D.  
The word **DOTTY** fits:
- Uses D (the needed letter) and adds a new letter Y to gather more information.
- Keeps T at the known green spot (position 3) and places another T at position 4, which should come back as yellow because the extra T is elsewhere.
- Places O at position 2 (which we know is not correct) to verify it will be marked gray, confirming O’s only correct spot is 5.
- The D at position 1 will be marked yellow, confirming D is not in the first slot.

Thus “DOTTY” is a valid, information‑rich next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a 5‑letter word that includes O and T in different positions from those excluded, and uses only letters not ruled out.  
The word **MOTTO** fits:
- Contains O (positions 2 and 5) – neither is position 3.
- Contains T (positions 3 and 4) – neither is position 5.

- Letter O appears twice (green at 5 and yellow at 2), so the second O is not at position 2.
- Letter T appears twice (green at 3 and yellow at 4), so the second T is not at position 4.

Thus the remaining three slots (1, 2, 4) must be filled with the letters D, O, and T, respecting:
