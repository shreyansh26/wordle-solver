### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and positions, which will give useful information for subsequent guesses. ""CRANE"" is a good starting word because it includes a vowel (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N).

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So the next word must contain A in a different slot (1, 2, 4, or 5) and must avoid C, R, N, E entirely. A good candidate is “ALBUM”: it places A in the first position and uses only letters (L, B, U, M) that haven’t been ruled out.

We know from previous feedback:
- Position 1 is A (green from ALBUM).
- Position 3 is B (green from ALBUM).
- Letters C, R, N, E, L, U, M are not in the word.
- A and B are confirmed present; other positions can use any letters not excluded.
We need a 5‑letter word of the form A ? B ? ?. 
Considering allowed letters, the word **ABBOT** fits:
- A in position 1, B in position 3.
- Uses only letters A, B, O, T (O and T have not been ruled out).
- No excluded letters appear.
Thus ABBOT is a valid next guess.
