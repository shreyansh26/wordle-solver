### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I'll choose a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains the frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know from the feedback that C and N are not in the secret word. The letters R, A, and E are present but each is in the wrong position in the guess ""CRANE"". Therefore:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions while avoiding C and N. The word **ALERT** satisfies these constraints:
- A is in position 1 (not position 3).
- L is a new letter to test.
- E is in position 3 (not position 5).
- R is in position 4 (not position 2).
- T is another new letter to test.

Thus “ALERT” is a good next guess.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, N, L, T.
- R is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (from ALERT).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (ALERT) or 3 (CRANE); therefore A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. Position 4 is occupied by R, so A must be in position 2 or 5.
- E is in the word but not in positions 3 (ALERT) or 5 (CRANE); thus E can be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Position 4 is R, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Combining these constraints, a viable pattern is:
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: A (since A can be 2 or 5 and using 5 avoids conflict with E)
- Position 2: E (since E can be 1 or 2 and using 2 avoids conflict with A)

Thus we need a word of the form **? E ? R A** that contains the letters A, E, R in the required spots and avoids the forbidden letters C, N, L, T.  

The word **ZEBRA** fits perfectly:
- Z (new letter)
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- B (new letter)
- R at position 4 (confirmed)
- A at position 5 (allowed)

All constraints are satisfied, and ZEBRA is a common English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be “ZEBRA”.
