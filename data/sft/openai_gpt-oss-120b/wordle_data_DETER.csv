### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Position 3 = T (✓ from guess 4)
- Position 4 = E (✓ from guess 4)
- Letters D and R are in the word (both got “-” in guess 2), but not in the positions they occupied there.
  • D cannot be at position 5, so D must be at position 1 or 2.
  • R cannot be at position 2, so R must be at position 1 or 5.
- Eliminated letters (x): S, L, A, I, C, O, M, B, U, N, plus any others marked x.
- All other positions are still open.

A word that satisfies all these conditions is **DETER**:
- Pattern: D E T E R
- Position 3 = T, Position 4 = E (correct).
- D is at position 1 (allowed), R is at position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters are used.

Thus the next guess should be DETER.
