### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new guess with E at the end, includes R in position 1, 3, or 4, and avoids C, A, N.

We have confirmed the first three letters and the last letter:
- F at position 1 (✓)
- O at position 2 (✓)
- R at position 3 (✓)
- E at position 5 (✓)

Letter G at position 4 got an x, so G is not in the word. All other letters marked x (C, A, N, W, S, H, D) are also absent.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **F O R _ E** with a new fourth letter that is not any of the eliminated letters. A common English word fitting this pattern is **FORTE** (meaning a strong point). The fourth letter T has not been ruled out, so ""FORTE"" is a logical next guess.
