### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Letters R, A, N, L, O, S, H, V are not in the word.

A suitable word that meets these constraints is **CUTIE**:

- U and T are not among the excluded letters.
