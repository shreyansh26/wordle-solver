# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ A _ E, with R present either in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2, 3, or 5). We need a valid 5‑letter word fitting this pattern and placing R in one of the allowed spots.

A good candidate is **STARE**:
- S (position 1) – acceptable.
- T (position 2) – acceptable.
- A (position 3) – matches the known correct A.
- R (position 4) – places R in a valid spot (not position 2).

All constraints are satisfied, and it introduces new letters S and T for further clues.
