### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start the game with an initial guess. A good opening word should contain common letters and varied positions. ""CRANE"" is a frequently used starter in Wordle-like games because it contains common consonants (C,R,N) and vowels (A,E). This will give us useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

We know:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- R and E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the new word must start with C, contain A somewhere other than position 3, contain N somewhere other than position 4, and avoid R and E.  
A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **CAPON** (C‑A‑P‑O‑N): it places A at position 2 (allowed), N at position 5 (allowed), and introduces new letters P and O to gather more information.

We know from feedback:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- N is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses). Since positions 1 and 2 are already C and A, N must be in position 3, giving C A N _ _.
- Letters R, E, P, O are not in the word.

We need a valid 5‑letter word starting with “CAN”. Possible choices are limited by the unused letters. “CANDY” fits the pattern, introduces new letters D and Y (which we haven’t ruled out), and respects all constraints.

Thus the next guess is CANDY.
