### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the first guess:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, and places R and E away from the forbidden spots.  
The word **REBEL** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains R (position 1, safe) and two E’s (positions 2 and 4, both not position 5).
- No C, A, or N.
- Is a valid English word.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters **C, A, N, B, L** are not in the word (all received “x”).
- **R** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (both guesses gave “-” for R).
- **E** is in the word, with a confirmed correct placement at position 4 (guess 2 gave “✓” for the fourth letter). The earlier “-” for E in guess 1 only tells us it isn’t at position 5, which is consistent with E being at 4.
- The fourth letter is therefore **E**.
- The word must contain **R** somewhere other than positions 1 or 2, i.e., at position 3 or 5.
- All other letters are still unknown, but they cannot be C, A, N, B, or L.

We need a 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern:
- _ _ R/E? E _ (R at position 3 or 5, E fixed at position 4).

One viable candidate is **SHRED**:
- Pattern: S‑H‑R‑E‑D
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (confirmed).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus “SHRED” satisfies all known constraints and is a valid guess.

A common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels is “CRANE”. This will give information about the presence of C, R, A, N, and E in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, and places R and E away from the forbidden spots.  
The word **REBEL** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains R (position 1, safe) and two E’s (positions 2 and 4, both not position 5).
- No C, A, or N.
- Is a valid English word.

Thus we will guess REBEL.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REBEL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters **C, A, N, B, L** are not in the word (all received “x”).
- **R** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (both guesses gave “-” for R).
- **E** is in the word, with a confirmed correct placement at position 4 (guess 2 gave “✓” for the fourth letter). The earlier “-” for E in guess 1 only tells us it isn’t at position 5, which is consistent with E being at 4.
- The fourth letter is therefore **E**.
- The word must contain **R** somewhere other than positions 1 or 2, i.e., at position 3 or 5.
- All other letters are still unknown, but they cannot be C, A, N, B, or L.

We need a 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern:
- _ _ R/E? E _ (R at position 3 or 5, E fixed at position 4).

One viable candidate is **SHRED**:
- Pattern: S‑H‑R‑E‑D
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (confirmed).
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus “SHRED” satisfies all known constraints and is a valid guess.

<guess>SHRED</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REBEL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: SHRED -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(-) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, B, L, S, D.
- Letter E is confirmed at position 4.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 → therefore R must be at position 5.
- Letter H is in the word but not at position 2 → H can be at position 1 or 3 (position 5 is taken by R).

Thus the pattern is either **H _ _ E R** or **_ H _ E R**.

A common English word fitting the first pattern and using only allowed letters is **HOVER** (H‑O‑V‑E‑R).  
O and V are not among the excluded letters, and the placement respects all prior clues.

So the next guess should be “HOVER”.

Current confirmed letters:
- Position 4: E (from guesses 2,3,4)
- Position 5: R (from guess 4)
- Position 3: H (since H was not at positions 1 or 2, and R is already at 5, the only remaining spot for H is position 3)

Thus the word pattern is **_ _ H E R**.

Letters known not to be in the word: C, A, N, B, L, S, D, O, V, and also the first position cannot be H (from guess 4).  
The second position cannot be H (from guess 3) and cannot be R (from earlier feedback).

A common English word fitting **_ _ H E R** and using only allowed letters is **ETHER** (E‑T‑H‑E‑R).  
- Position 3 = H (correct).  
- Position 4 = E (correct).  
- Position 5 = R (correct).  
- Positions 1 and 2 (E, T) are still possible; neither E nor T have been ruled out for those spots.

Therefore the next guess should be “ETHER”.
