### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters C, A, and N, but not R or E. The positions from the first guess tell us:
- C cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes C, A, and N, respects those position restrictions, and avoids R and E.  
“CANAL” fits:
- C is in position 2 (allowed).
- A appears in positions 1 and 4 (allowed, not position 3).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- No prohibited letters R or E are used.

Thus “CANAL” is a valid next guess.
