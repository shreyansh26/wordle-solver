### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern _ A _ _ E with confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = A (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)

From guess GABLE we learned:
- G and L are not in the word (x)
- B is in the word but not in position 3 (‑). Therefore B must be at position 1 or 4.

All letters marked x so far are excluded: C, R, N, P, U, S, M, I, Z, G, L.

We need a 5‑letter word matching _ A _ _ E, containing B (not at position 3), and using only allowed letters.  

A good candidate is **BATHE**:
- B at position 1 (acceptable)
- A at position 2 (✓)
- T and H are new letters (to test)
- E at position 5 (✓)

This satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters for further narrowing.
