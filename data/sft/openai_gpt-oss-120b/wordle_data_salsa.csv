### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Position 2 is A (A✓ from guesses 2,3,4).
- Position 3 is L (L✓ from guess 3 and 4).
- Position 4 is S (S✓ from guess 4).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, I, H, T, P, Y, plus any others from prior “x” feedback.
- The remaining unknown positions are 1 and 5.

We need a 5‑letter English word of the form _ A L S _. It must avoid the eliminated letters and can reuse known letters if needed. The common word **SALSA** fits perfectly:
- S at position 1 (allowed, since S isn’t ruled out there)
- A at position 2 (✓)
- L at position 3 (✓)
- S at position 4 (✓)
- A at position 5 (no conflict with any “x” letters)

Thus SALSA is a valid next guess.
