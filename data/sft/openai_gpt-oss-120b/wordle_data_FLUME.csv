### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the correct letters and positions from previous feedback:
- Position 1: F (✓)
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)
- Position 4 is still unknown, but T is not correct there (x).

All letters that have received an “x” are excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, O, K, G, I, D, T.

The remaining possible letters for position 4 include B, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. A common English word fitting the pattern F L U _ E with a valid fourth letter is **FLUME** (M is permissible and not excluded).

Thus the next guess should be “flume”.
