### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain R and E, exclude C, A, N, place R somewhere other than the second slot, and place E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 2 (ROVER): R at position 1 is not correct (so R exists elsewhere), O and V are not in the word, E at position 4 is correct, R at position 5 is correct.

From these clues:
- The word ends with **E R** (positions 4‑5 are E,R).
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from guess 1) and the only confirmed R is at position 5.
- No letters C, A, N, O, V are allowed anywhere.
- The remaining letters (positions 1‑3) must be chosen from the unused alphabet while avoiding the excluded letters.

A good next guess is **WIDER** (W I D E R). It respects all known constraints and introduces three new letters (W, I, D) to gather more information.

- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain R and E, exclude C, A, N, place R somewhere other than the second slot, and place E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **ROVER**:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5, neither is position 2) and E (position 4, not position 5).
- Uses none of the forbidden letters C, A, N.

I will submit this as the next guess.

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C is not in the word, R is in the word but not in position 2, A and N are not in the word, E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 2 (ROVER): R at position 1 is not correct (so R exists elsewhere), O and V are not in the word, E at position 4 is correct, R at position 5 is correct.

From these clues:
- The word ends with **E R** (positions 4‑5 are E,R).
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from guess 1) and the only confirmed R is at position 5.
- No letters C, A, N, O, V are allowed anywhere.
- The remaining letters (positions 1‑3) must be chosen from the unused alphabet while avoiding the excluded letters.

A good next guess is **WIDER** (W I D E R). It respects all known constraints and introduces three new letters (W, I, D) to gather more information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- **R** appears only at position 5 (the earlier R’s were marked “-”, confirming it isn’t elsewhere).

Thus the pattern is **_ _ _ E R**, with an extra **E** somewhere in the first three letters and **M** occupying either position 2 or 3.
