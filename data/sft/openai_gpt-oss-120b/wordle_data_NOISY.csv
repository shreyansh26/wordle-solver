### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it was fourth in “CRANE”). Therefore I need a new 5‑letter word that includes N in a different position and avoids C, R, A, E.
A good candidate is “NIGHT”, which places N in the first position and uses only letters not ruled out.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word starts with **N** (N is correct in position 1).
- The letter **I** is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters **C, R, A, E, G, H, T** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word that:
1. Begins with N,
2. Contains I somewhere other than the second slot,
3. Uses none of the excluded letters.

The word **NOISY** satisfies all conditions:
- N is first.
- I is in the third position.
- It contains only the letters N, O, I, S, Y, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus, the next logical guess is “NOISY”.
