### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word starts with **S** (position 1 is correct).
- The letters **C, R, A, N, E, P, O, L** are not in the word.
- The letter **I** is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Has **S** as the first letter.
2. Contains **I** somewhere other than the fourth position.
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is **SIGHT**:
- S in position 1 matches the known correct spot.
- I is in position 2 (acceptable, not position 4).
- G, H, T are new letters that haven’t been eliminated.

Thus “SIGHT” satisfies all current constraints and will give us more information.

- Letters in the word but misplaced: I and H.
  * I cannot be in position 2 (from SIGHT) and cannot be in position 4 (from SPOIL), so I can be in positions 3 or 5.
  * H cannot be in position 4 (from SIGHT), so H can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Position 4 must be a letter that is neither I nor H and not any of the excluded letters.
