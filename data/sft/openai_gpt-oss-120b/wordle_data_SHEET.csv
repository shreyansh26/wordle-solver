### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE, we know:

- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was marked “-” in CRANE).

- Exclude C, R, A, N.

- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

We have confirmed letters: position 1 = S, positions 3 & 4 = E, position 5 = T. The only unknown is the second letter. Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, L, P, K, W. The word must be of the form S?EET and use a letter not eliminated. Viable English words fitting this pattern include ""SHEET"" (with H) and ""SMEET"" (M, but not common). ""SHEET"" is a common word and H is not eliminated, so we guess that.
