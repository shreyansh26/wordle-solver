### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, balanced word that contains frequently used letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful information. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes the letters C, R, A, N, and E.

The first letter is confirmed as C in the correct spot. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. I need a 5‑letter word starting with C that avoids those letters. “CLOTH” fits: C L O T H contains none of the excluded letters.

We know the first letter is C (✓). Letters R, A, N, E, L, T, H are not in the word. The letter O is in the word but not in position 3 (from the '-' feedback on the guess CLOTH). So the secret word pattern is:

C _ _ _ _
- O must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Remaining letters cannot be R, A, N, E, L, T, H.

A common word that fits these constraints is **COMIC**:
- C in position 1 (matches the known ✓).
- O in position 2 (allowed, O is not in position 3).
- M, I, C fill positions 3‑5 with letters not ruled out.

This guess will test O’s exact spot and introduce new letters M and I.
