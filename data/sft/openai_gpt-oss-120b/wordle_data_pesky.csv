### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRATE, I learned that C, R, A, and T are not in the secret word at all, while E is present but not in the fifth position. Therefore, the next guess should:

- Introduce new letters to test possibilities.

- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

We need a valid 5‑letter word of the form _ E _ _ _. Choose a word that uses only letters not yet ruled out and introduces new letters to gather more information.

“HEWED” (H E W E D) fits: E is correctly in position 2, and the other letters H, W, D have not been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have determined from the latest feedback:
- Position 2 is E (✓).
- Position 3 is S (✓).
- Position 5 is Y (✓).
- Position 4 is S (‑), meaning S is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have S at position 3, this does not force another S; the word could simply have one S at position 3.

Thus the pattern is _ E S _ Y. We need a common English word fitting that pattern using letters not yet eliminated (C,R,A,T,B,G,U,N,F,L,I,X,H,W,D,M are all out). The word **PESKY** fits perfectly:
- P is unused and not excluded.
- K is unused and not excluded.
- It matches the pattern _ E S _ Y.

So the next guess should be PESKY.
