# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need an initial guess that covers common letters and vowel distribution to maximize information. A good starter word is “CRANE”, which includes three common consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E). This will give us useful feedback for the next steps.

We need to incorporate the known letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in during the first guess (A not position 3, E not position 5). Also avoid letters C, R, N which were marked absent. Choosing a word that places A and E elsewhere and introduces new letters for testing is optimal. “SEPAL” puts E at position 2 and A at position 4, satisfying the constraints, and includes new letters S, P, L for further elimination.

We have collected the following information:

- From CRANE: C, R, N are NOT in the word. A is present but NOT in position 3. E is present but NOT in position 5.
- From SEPAL: S, P are NOT in the word. A is correct in position 4. L is present but NOT in position 5. E is present but NOT in position 2.

Thus the secret word must contain:
- A at position 4.
- E somewhere (cannot be positions 2, 4, or 5) → possible positions 1 or 3.
- L somewhere (cannot be position 5) → possible positions 1, 2, or 3.

All other letters must avoid the excluded set {C, R, N, S, P}.

A word that satisfies these constraints is **BLEAT**:
- B L E A T
- L is at position 2 (allowed), E at position 3 (allowed), A at position 4 (required), and the remaining letters B and T are not among the excluded letters.

Therefore, “BLEAT” is a logical next guess.
