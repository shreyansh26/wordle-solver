### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common, balanced five‑letter word that includes a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. “CRANE” contains two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently used consonants (C, R, N), which should give good information about the secret word.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: none of C,R,A,N,E are in the word.
- From MOTHS: M is not, O is correct at position 2, T, H, S are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (T not 3rd, H not 4th, S not 5th).

Thus the secret word must have O at the second slot, and contain the letters T, H, S in other slots, avoiding the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M).  

Trying to place S at the first position works (since S cannot be fifth). Then we need to arrange T and H avoiding their forbidden positions (T cannot be third, H cannot be fourth). The pattern **S O _ T H** satisfies all constraints, with the third slot filled by another allowed letter. The word “SOOTH” (meaning truth or old‑fashioned verb “to soothe”) fits perfectly:  

- Position 1: S (allowed)  
- Position 2: O (confirmed)  
- Position 3: O (a permissible extra O)  
- Position 4: T (not the forbidden third position)  
- Position 5: H (not the forbidden fourth position)  

All letters are allowed, and no excluded letters appear. This makes “SOOTH” the best next guess.
