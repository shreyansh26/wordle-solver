### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is present but not in the third position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore the next guess must include A in a different slot and avoid the excluded letters. “AUDIO” satisfies these constraints: it contains A (in position 1), and its other letters U, D, I, O are not among the forbidden ones.

From the feedback:
- The secret word does **not** contain C, R, N, E, U, D, I.
- The letter **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 5 is O). So A must be in position 2 or 4.
- The letter **O** is correct in position 5.

Thus the word pattern is either:
1. _ A _ _ O   (A in position 2) or
2. _ _ _ A O   (A in position 4).

I need a valid 5‑letter word that respects these constraints and also tests new letters. “FATSO” fits pattern 1 (F A T S O), uses allowed letters (F, T, S) and places A correctly at position 2 while keeping O at the known final position.

I will guess “FATSO”.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have established the following from the feedback:
- Position 2 is **A** (confirmed by FATSO).
- Position 5 is **O** (confirmed by AUDIO and FATSO).
- O is not in position 4 (KAZOO gave O(-) at position 4).
- Letters that are **not** in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, F, T, S, K, Z (and also the letters from earlier guesses that were marked x).

Thus the secret word must follow the pattern: _ A _ _ O, with O only at the last position.

We need a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses none of the excluded letters.  
Possible candidates include:
- **MAMBO** (M A M B O) – uses only M, B, which have not been ruled out.
- **HALLO** (H A L L O) – also fits, but “hallo” is less common.
- **LAMBO** – borderline slang.

Choosing **MAMBO** provides a clear, common word that respects all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is:
