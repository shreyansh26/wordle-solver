# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G are not in the secret word.
- H and T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ""MIGHT"": H is not position 4, T is not position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes H and T, places them in different positions (avoiding those forbidden spots), and uses only letters not ruled out.  
A suitable word is **THUDS**:
- Contains H (position 2, not 4) and T (position 1, not 5).
- Uses only allowed letters (T, H, U, D, S).
Thus it satisfies all constraints and will give more information.

We know from feedback:

  * H cannot be in positions 2 (from THUDS) or 4 (from MIGHT); it can be 1,3,5.
  * T cannot be in positions 1 (THUDS) or 5 (MIGHT); it can be 2,3,4.
