### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct at position 5.

So the secret word ends with E, contains R and N, and excludes C and A. R cannot be the second letter, N cannot be the fourth letter.

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **SNORE**:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 4 (allowed).
- No C or A.

Thus the next guess will be SNORE.

From the feedback:
- The word ends with **E** (position 5).
- Letters **R** and **N** are both in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses:
  * R cannot be in positions 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SNORE).
  * N cannot be in positions 4 (from CRANE) or 2 (from SNORE).
- Therefore R and N must occupy positions 1 and 3 in some order.
- Excluded letters are **C, A, S, O** (and any other letters marked “x”).

A common English word that fits these constraints is **NERVE**:
- Pattern N ? R ? E → N at position 1, R at position 3, E at position 5.
- Positions 2 and 4 are filled with **E** and **V**, both of which have not been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus the next guess should be **NERVE**.
