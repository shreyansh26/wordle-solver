### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L, D are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing I (not at position 3), and avoiding the excluded letters.

We have confirmed:
- Position 5 is E (green).
- Position 4 is I (green).
- The secret contains at least two I’s (the extra I received a yellow), so another I must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Position 2 cannot be I because the I in that spot was marked yellow, meaning it’s in the word but not at position 2. Therefore the remaining I is either at position 1 or 3.

Letters known not to appear: C, R, A, N, S, L, D, P, X.

To gather more information about the first three positions while respecting these constraints, we can guess a common word that ends in “IE” with I in the fourth slot and avoids all excluded letters. “MOVIE” fits:
- Ends with I‑E (positions 4‑5 are I E, matching the green clues).
- Uses new letters M, O, V in positions 1‑3, none of which have been ruled out.
- Does not introduce any prohibited letters.

This guess will tell us whether M, O, or V belong in the secret word and help locate the second I.
