### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I'll choose a common, balanced word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information for future guesses. ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct at position 1.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- A and N are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E, containing an R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be position 2). We need a valid word matching this pattern without A or N.

The word **CHORE** fits:
- C at position 1 (correct).
- H and O fill positions 2 and 3 (allowed letters).
- R at position 4 (R present, not in position 2).
- E at position 5 (correct).

All constraints are satisfied, so CHORE is a good next guess.
