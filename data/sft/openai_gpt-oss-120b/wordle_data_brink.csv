### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This should give a solid spread of feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first guess:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- Letters C, A, E are not in the word at all (x).
Thus the word fits the pattern _ R _ N _. I need a common English word with R in the second slot and N in the fourth slot, avoiding C, A, and E. “GRIND” (G R I N D) satisfies all constraints, so I’ll guess that.
