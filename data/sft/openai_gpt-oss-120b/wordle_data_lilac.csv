### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give me useful information about the secret word. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). This should reveal a lot about which letters are present and their positions.

The feedback from the first guess SLATE tells us:
- S, T, and E are not in the secret word.
- L and A are in the word, but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3).

We need a new guess that includes L and A in different positions, and avoids S, T, and E. Choosing “LARVA” places L in position 1 and A in positions 2 and 5, satisfying the positional constraints while introducing new letters (R, V) to gather more information.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word starts with **L** (position 1 is correct).
- The word contains an **A**, but not in positions 2 or 5. So A must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **S, T, E, R, V** are not in the word.
- We still need three more letters (positions 2‑5) that avoid the excluded letters.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is **LILAC**:
- L is fixed at position 1.
- A appears in position 4 (allowed).
- The remaining letters I, L, C have not been ruled out and introduce new information.
Thus we guess **LILAC**.
