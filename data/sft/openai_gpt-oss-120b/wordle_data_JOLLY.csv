### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback so far tells us:
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 → O can be 1, 2, or 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 1 → L can be 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a word containing both O and L, using only the allowed letters, respecting those position constraints.

The word **DOLLY** fits:
- Letters D, O, L, L, Y are all allowed.
- O is at position 2 (allowed).
- L appears at positions 3 and 4 (neither is position 1, allowed).
Thus it satisfies all known constraints and gives new information about the remaining letters.

Proceed with the guess “DOLLY”.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ O L L Y based on feedback:
- O is correct in position 2.
- L is correct in positions 3 and 4.
- Y is correct in position 5.
All other letters guessed so far are not in the word.

Possible words fitting the pattern are **JOLLY**, **FOLLY**, and **GOLLY** (other options use already excluded letters). To identify the correct first letter, I will guess **FOLLY**, which tests the letter F at position 1 while keeping the known correct letters in place.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
