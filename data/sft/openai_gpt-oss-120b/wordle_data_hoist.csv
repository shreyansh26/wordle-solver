### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All five letters from CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent from the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter guess using entirely different letters to gather more information.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M are not in the secret word.
- I is correct in position 3.
- S, T, H are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in the guess “SMITH” (positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).

Thus:
- I must stay at the third slot.
- S cannot be at position 1.
- T cannot be at position 4.
- H cannot be at position 5.

We need a new word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more information.  
The word **THIGH** fits:

- Pattern: T (pos1), H (pos2), I (pos3 – correct), G (pos4), H (pos5).  
- T is not in position 4 (good).  
- H is not in position 5 (good).  
- No prohibited letters are used.  

This guess will test T and H in new positions and add a fresh letter G while keeping I fixed.
