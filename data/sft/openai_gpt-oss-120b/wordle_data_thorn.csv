### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I’ll start with a common opening guess that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good initial choice because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain R and N, placed elsewhere. I need a new 5‑letter word that includes both R and N, avoids C, A, E, and does not put R in the second slot or N in the fourth slot.

""RINGS"" satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3).
- No C, A, or E.
- R is not in the 2nd position, N is not in the 4th position.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

We have two guesses with feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
   - Letters not in the word: C, A, E.  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. RINGS → R(-), I(x), N(-), G(x), S(x)  
   - Additional letters not in the word: I, G, S.  
   - R is also not in position 1.  
   - N is also not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain **R** and **N**, and cannot contain C, A, E, I, G, S.  
Possible positions:
- R cannot be 1 or 2 → possible positions 3, 4, 5.  
- N cannot be 3 or 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 5.

A common English word that satisfies these constraints is **THORN** (T‑H‑O‑R‑N):
- R is at position 4 (allowed).  
- N is at position 5 (allowed).  
- No prohibited letters are used.

Therefore “THORN” is a valid next guess.
