### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, or “ROAST” are good candidates. I’ll start with “CRANE”.

- E is correct at position 3.
- S is in the word but not at position 1 (and not at position 3, obviously). So S can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with E third, containing S in one of those allowed spots, and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. 

The word **GUEST** fits:
- Pattern _:_:E_:_ → G U E S T (E is third).
- S is at position 4, which is allowed.
