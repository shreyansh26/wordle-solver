### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word contains none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E. I need to choose a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely, while still using common letters to maximize information. Possible candidates include “CRONY”, “BUNCH”, “MIRKY”, etc. I’ll pick “CRONY” because it uses five distinct letters (C, R, O, N, Y) that are all allowed.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, C, N are not in the secret word.
- Y is correct in position 5.
- R and O are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRONY” (R not in position 2, O not in position 3).

We need a 5‑letter word ending in Y, containing R and O in different positions (avoid R at 2 and O at 3). “WORRY” fits:
- Pattern: W O R R Y → Y is correctly placed at 5.
- O is at position 2 (allowed), R appears at positions 3 and 4 (both allowed).
- All other letters (W, O, R) have not been ruled out.

Thus “WORRY” is a valid next guess.
