### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a variety of common letters and vowel placements. “CRANE” includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good baseline for the first feedback.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. It does contain the letter A, but A is not in the third position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore, our next guess must include A in a different slot (1, 2, 4, or 5) and must avoid C, R, N, and E entirely. A common word that satisfies these constraints is “BALMY” (B A L M Y): it has A in position 2, and none of the prohibited letters appear.

We have the pattern from feedback:

- Position 1: B (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, M.

So the secret word is **B A _ _ Y** with the remaining letters not being any of the excluded ones. Good candidates include words like **BAS​SY**, **BASHY**, **BATHY**, **BAWDY**, etc.

Choosing a guess that introduces two fresh letters will give us the most information about the unknown positions. “BAWDY” adds the letters **W** and **D**, both of which have not been tested yet. This will tell us whether either of those letters belongs in positions 3 or 4 (or not at all).

Therefore, the next guess is “BAWDY”.
