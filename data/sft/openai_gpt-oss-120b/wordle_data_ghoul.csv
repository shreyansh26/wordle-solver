### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have these constraints from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → possible positions 1,3,5.
- O is in the word but not in position 2 → possible positions 1,3,4,5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains L and O, respects those position limits, and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.  

The word **LIMBO** fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- O is at position 5 (allowed, not position 2).
- All other letters (I, M, B) are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “LIMBO” is a valid next guess.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

The only configurations that satisfy both are:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- S, A, T, E are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes L in a different position and introduces new letters to test. “WORLD” places L at position 4 and adds W, O, R, D, all of which have not been ruled out yet. This will give us more information about possible letters and positions.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have these constraints from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → possible positions 1,3,5.
- O is in the word but not in position 2 → possible positions 1,3,4,5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains L and O, respects those position limits, and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.  

The word **LIMBO** fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- O is at position 5 (allowed, not position 2).
- All other letters (I, M, B) are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “LIMBO” is a valid next guess.

Remaining possible letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

From feedback:
- L is in the word but not in positions 1,2,4 → L can be at 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not in positions 2,5 → O can be at 1,3,4.

A word that satisfies these constraints using only allowed letters is **CYLON** (C Y L O N):
- L is at position 3 (allowed).
- O is at position 4 (allowed).
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Thus CYLON is a logical next guess.

We have determined the secret word must have O at position 3 (confirmed by QUOIL) and L at position 5 (also confirmed). The letter U is present but not at position 2, and the only remaining positions for U are 1 or 4; however, position 1 cannot be U because the word would start with U and no common English word fits the pattern. Thus U must be at position 4, giving the pattern __OUL.

All letters marked “x” are excluded: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, I, M, B, C, Y, N, Q. Remaining permissible letters are F, G, H, J, K, P, V, X, Z plus the known O, L, U.

A valid English word fitting __OUL using only allowed letters is **GHOUL** (G H O U L). This satisfies all positional constraints and introduces only new letters that have not been eliminated.

Therefore the next guess should be GHOUL.
