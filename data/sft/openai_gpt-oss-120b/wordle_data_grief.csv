### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct at position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _, includes an E somewhere in positions 1,3, or 4, and does not contain C, A, or N.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **FRESH** (F R E S H): R is in position 2, E is in position 3 (not position 5), and none of the excluded letters appear.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: R is correct at position 2. E is in the word but not at position 5.
- From FRESH: R still correct at position 2. E is in the word but not at position 3 (the “-” means wrong spot). F is in the word but not at position 1. S and H are not in the word.

Combining:
* Position 2 = R.
* E can only be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).
* F can be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1, and position 2 is taken by R).
* Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, H.
We need a real five‑letter word that satisfies these constraints.

The word **GRIEF** fits:
- Position 1 = G (allowed, not excluded)
- Position 2 = R (fixed)
- Position 3 = I (allowed)
- Position 4 = E (E is allowed here)
- Position 5 = F (F is allowed here and not at position 1)

All required letters (R, E, F) are present, and none of the forbidden letters appear. So “GRIEF” is a valid next guess.
