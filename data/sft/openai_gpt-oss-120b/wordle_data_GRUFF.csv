### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and varied positions to give useful feedback. “CRANE” is a popular starter in these games because it contains frequently occurring letters (C, R, A, N, E) and a mix of consonants and a vowel.

From the first guess CRANE, we learned:
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- R is correct and in the second position.

So the secret word has the pattern _ R _ _ _. The remaining letters must avoid C, A, N, E. I’ll choose a word that introduces several new letters while keeping R in the second slot. “FROST” fits: it follows the pattern (F R O S T) and contains only letters we haven’t tested yet.

We know:
- R is correct in position 2.
- F is in the word but not in position 1 (F was marked “-” in FROST).
- Letters C, A, N, E, O, S, T are not in the word.

We need a word of the form _ R _ _ _, containing F somewhere other than the first slot and using only the remaining allowed letters (B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus F and R). 

A suitable common word that fits these constraints is **GRUFF**:
- Pattern G R U F F (R is in the correct second position).
- It includes F (in positions 4 and 5), satisfying the “F is in the word but not in position 1”.
- It uses only allowed letters (G, R, U, F) and avoids all excluded letters.

Thus “GRUFF” is a logical next guess.
