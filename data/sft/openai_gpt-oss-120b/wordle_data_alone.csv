### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common, balanced starter that includes a mix of common letters and vowel placement. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it contains two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving a good chance to learn about both consonant and vowel presence and positions.

We know:
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3, so A must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters C and R are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ N E that contains A in position 1 or 2 and avoids C and R. 

A good candidate that introduces new letters is **ATONE** (A T O N E): 
- A is in position 1 (satisfies the “A in word, wrong spot” clue).
- N and E are already correct in positions 4 and 5.
- T and O are new letters to test.

Thus the next guess will be ATONE.
