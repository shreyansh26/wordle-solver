### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes three of the most frequent letters (C, R, N) and both a common vowel (A, E) and a consonant (C) that can help identify positions quickly.

From the first feedback:
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C and A are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is _ R _ N _. E must be at position 1 or 3 (since not 5). Choosing a common word that fits, “BRENT” (B R E N T) satisfies all known constraints.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 3: E (✓ from guess 2)
- Position 4: N (✓ from both guesses)
- Letter T is present but not in position 5, and positions 2‑4 are occupied, so T must be at position 1.
