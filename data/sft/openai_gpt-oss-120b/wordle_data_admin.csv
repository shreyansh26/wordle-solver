### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain S, L, T, or E.  
It does contain the letter A, but A is not in the third position (the position it occupied in “SLATE”).  
Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess we should include A in a different position and introduce several new letters to learn more about the word while avoiding the letters we already know are absent.  
A good candidate is **MARCH**:
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters M, R, C, H to test.
- Uses no prohibited letters (S, L, T, E).

Thus we will guess “MARCH”.

We have gathered feedback:

- From SLATE: only A is present, but not in position 3.
- From MARCH: A and M are present, both in wrong spots. Additionally, R, C, H are absent.

- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from MARCH and SLATE). It can be 1, 4, or 5.

We have the following information after three guesses:

- Letters **S, L, T, E, R, C, H, N, O** are not in the secret word.
- **M** is confirmed and correctly placed at position 3 (from “NOMAD” → M(✓)).
- **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in SLATE (pos 3), MARCH (pos 2), and NOMAD (pos 4)). Therefore A must be at position 1 or 5.
- **D** is in the word but cannot be at position 5 (it was “-” in NOMAD). So D can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

We need a five‑letter word with M fixed at the third spot, containing A and D in allowed positions, and introducing two new letters to continue testing.  
Placing A at position 1 satisfies its constraints, and putting D at position 2 satisfies its constraint (not position 5). That gives the pattern **A D M _ _**.  

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not yet ruled out is **ADMIX** (meaning “to mix”). It adds the new letters I and X for further information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain S, L, T, or E.  
It does contain the letter A, but A is not in the third position (the position it occupied in “SLATE”).  
Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess we should include A in a different position and introduce several new letters to learn more about the word while avoiding the letters we already know are absent.  
A good candidate is **MARCH**:
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters M, R, C, H to test.
- Uses no prohibited letters (S, L, T, E).

Thus we will guess “MARCH”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MARCH -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) R(x) C(x) H(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have gathered feedback:

- From SLATE: only A is present, but not in position 3.
- From MARCH: A and M are present, both in wrong spots. Additionally, R, C, H are absent.

Thus the secret word contains letters A and M, and excludes S, L, T, E, R, C, H.  

Positions constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from MARCH and SLATE). It can be 1, 4, or 5.
- M cannot be in position 1 (from MARCH). It can be 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a new guess that places A and M in different spots respecting these constraints and introduces new letters to test.  
The word **NOMAD** fits:
- N O M A D uses A at position 4 (allowed) and M at position 3 (allowed).
- It adds three fresh letters N, O, D that haven’t been tested yet.
- None of the forbidden letters appear.

Thus “NOMAD” is a good next guess.

<guess>NOMAD</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MARCH -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) R(x) C(x) H(x)
Guess 3: NOMAD -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) M(✓) A(-) D(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information after three guesses:

- Letters **S, L, T, E, R, C, H, N, O** are not in the secret word.
- **M** is confirmed and correctly placed at position 3 (from “NOMAD” → M(✓)).
- **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in SLATE (pos 3), MARCH (pos 2), and NOMAD (pos 4)). Therefore A must be at position 1 or 5.
- **D** is in the word but cannot be at position 5 (it was “-” in NOMAD). So D can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

We need a five‑letter word with M fixed at the third spot, containing A and D in allowed positions, and introducing two new letters to continue testing.  
Placing A at position 1 satisfies its constraints, and putting D at position 2 satisfies its constraint (not position 5). That gives the pattern **A D M _ _**.  

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not yet ruled out is **ADMIX** (meaning “to mix”). It adds the new letters I and X for further information.

Thus the next guess is “ADMIX”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
