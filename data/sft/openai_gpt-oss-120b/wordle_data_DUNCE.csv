### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word ends with **E**, contains **C** and **N** (neither in the positions they appeared in CRANE), and does not contain R or A. We need a new 5‑letter word satisfying these constraints. “UNCLE” fits:
- Ends with E.
- Contains C (position 3) and N (position 2), both not in their previous spots.
- No R or A.

So “UNCLE” is a valid next guess.
