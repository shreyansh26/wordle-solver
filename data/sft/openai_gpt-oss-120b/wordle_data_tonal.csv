### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening guess that contains a mix of frequent letters and good vowel coverage. “CRANE” includes two common consonants (C, R) and both a common vowel (A) and another vowel (E) plus N. This should give useful information about the hidden word.

From the first guess CRANE we know:

- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, R, E, V, I are not in the word.
- L is correct at position 5.
- A and N are both in the word but not in the positions they occupied in the guesses:
   * A is not in positions 1 (from ANVIL) nor 3 (from CRANE).
   * N is not in positions 2 (from ANVIL) nor 4 (from CRANE).
Thus possible placements:
- A can be in positions 2 or 4.
- N can be in positions 1 or 3.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **NATAL**:
- N at position 1 (allowed),
- A at position 2 (allowed),
- T at position 3 (neither forbidden nor previously ruled out),
- A at position 4 (allowed),
- L at position 5 (confirmed correct).

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, E, V, I.
- L is correct at position 5.
- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 → must be position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 3 → therefore T must be in position 1 or 2.
- Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with T and another allowed letter (any letter except the excluded ones).

The pattern is therefore **_ _ N A L**, with T occupying either the first or second slot.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **TONAL** (T O N A L), satisfying all constraints:
- T is at position 1 (allowed);
- O is a new letter not ruled out;
- N A L are already placed correctly.

Thus the next guess should be ""TONAL"".
