### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have pattern _ R I E D with positions 2-5 fixed. Letters eliminated: C, A, N, T, F, P. Possible first letters that haven't been ruled out include B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, common English words ending with R I E D: ""DRIED"" (D R I E D) is a common word. ""BRIED"" is obscure; ""GRIED"" not a word. So the best guess is DRIED.
