We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: B is correct (✓).
- Position 2: O is correct (✓).
- Position 3: O is correct (✓).
- Position 4: Z is not in the word (x), so the fourth letter is unknown but must be a letter not yet ruled out.
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓).

Thus the word looks like B O O _ Y. The remaining possible letters for the fourth slot are those not previously marked as absent: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, X, or possibly B again. The common English word that fits this pattern is **BOOBY** (B O O B Y). This uses only allowed letters and is a valid 5‑letter word.

We will guess BOOBY to test if the fourth letter is B.
