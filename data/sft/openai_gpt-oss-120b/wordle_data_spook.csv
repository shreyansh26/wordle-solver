### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:
- From SPOKY: S, P, O are correct in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- K is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 5.
- Y is not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is S P O _ K, with the fourth letter unknown but not K and not any previously eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G, H, J, U, M, B, Y).

A common English word fitting this pattern is **SPOOK** (S P O O K). This satisfies all constraints: K is in position 5, O appears again in position 4 (allowed), and no eliminated letters are used.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SPOOK"".
