We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Position 4 is still unknown. Letters that are NOT in the word (from prior feedback) are: L, T, P, D, R.

Thus the secret word matches the pattern S H A _ E, with the fourth letter not being L, T, P, D, or R.

Common English words fitting this pattern are:
- SHAME (M as fourth letter)
- SHAVE (V as fourth letter)
- SHAKE (K as fourth letter)

Each introduces a new letter not yet tested. I will guess ""SHAME"" to test M in the fourth position.
