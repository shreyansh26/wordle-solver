### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters, to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these games because it includes the common letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both vowels and consonants.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has R in the second position and E in the fifth position: pattern _ R _ _ E. Letters C, A, and N are confirmed not to be in the word. We should choose a new guess that respects the known positions and avoids the excluded letters, while introducing new letters to test. A good candidate is “PROBE” (P R O B E), which fits the pattern and adds P, O, and B for further clues.
