### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I want to start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in these word games because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give me a good spread of feedback to narrow down the secret word.

- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the next guess must include the letter C somewhere other than the first slot, and must avoid using R, A, N, E.

We have the following feedback:

- Position 1: S is correct (✓).
- Position 2: T was guessed and is not in the word (x). So the second letter is not T.
- Position 3: O is correct (✓).
- Position 4: C is correct (✓).
- Position 5: K is correct (✓).

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **S ? O C K** with the second letter unknown but not T and not any previously eliminated letters (R, A, N, E, M, U, I, L, D, T). 

The plausible English word that fits this pattern is **SHOCK**, using H in the second position, which has not been ruled out. This is a common valid word, so we will guess it.
