### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter: it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and the vowel A, plus E at the end. This should give a broad sense of which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the first guess that S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word at all, and E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So the next guess should include E in a different position (1‑4) and avoid using S, L, A, T. A common word that fits is **BERRY**, which places E in the second slot and introduces new letters B, R, Y for testing.

We have the following constraints from prior feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, B, R are not in the secret word.
- The letter Y is correct and in the 5th position.
- The letter E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5. Therefore it must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- We need a new guess that keeps Y at the end, includes E in one of the allowed spots, and introduces new letters to further narrow possibilities.

Choosing **ENVOY** places E at position 1 (testing if that’s the correct spot) and adds the new letters N, V, O while still ending with Y. This will give us more information about the correct placement of E and about the other letters.
