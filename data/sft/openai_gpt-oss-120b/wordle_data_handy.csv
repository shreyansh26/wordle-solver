### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): only A and N are in the word, both in wrong spots.
- From guess 2 (MANTA): A in position 2 is correct (✓), N in position 3 is correct (✓). The second A (position 5) is present but not in that spot (‑), meaning the secret contains at least two As.  
Thus far:
- Position 2 = A  
- Position 3 = N  
- There is another A somewhere not at position 5 (could be 1 or 4).  

Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, E, M, T.  

We need a new 5‑letter word fitting the pattern _ A N _ _. It must include a second A (not at position 5) and avoid the excluded letters.  
A valid English word that satisfies all constraints is **LANAI** (L A N A I).  
- Position 1 = L (new letter to test)  
- Position 2 = A (matches known ✓)  
- Position 3 = N (matches known ✓)  
- Position 4 = A (places the second A, not at position 5)  
- Position 5 = I (new letter)  

All letters L and I are not among the excluded set, so this guess is legal and informative.

- Not place A in position 3 nor N in position 4.
- Exclude C, R, E entirely.

A common word that satisfies all these constraints is **MANTA** (M A N T A):
- Contains A (positions 2 & 5) and N (position 3).
- No C, R, or E.
- A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: MANTA -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(✓) T(x) A(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): only A and N are in the word, both in wrong spots.
- From guess 2 (MANTA): A in position 2 is correct (✓), N in position 3 is correct (✓). The second A (position 5) is present but not in that spot (‑), meaning the secret contains at least two As.  
Thus far:
- Position 2 = A  
- Position 3 = N  
- There is another A somewhere not at position 5 (could be 1 or 4).  

Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, E, M, T.  

We need a new 5‑letter word fitting the pattern _ A N _ _. It must include a second A (not at position 5) and avoid the excluded letters.  
A valid English word that satisfies all constraints is **LANAI** (L A N A I).  
- Position 1 = L (new letter to test)  
- Position 2 = A (matches known ✓)  
- Position 3 = N (matches known ✓)  
- Position 4 = A (places the second A, not at position 5)  
- Position 5 = I (new letter)  

All letters L and I are not among the excluded set, so this guess is legal and informative.

Guess 3: LANAI -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) I(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is **A** (✓ from guess 2 and 3).
- Position 3 is **N** (✓ from guess 2 and 3).
- Letters **C, R, E, M, T, L, I** are definitely not in the word.
- The extra A’s in previous guesses gave “‑”, but we cannot be certain the secret contains more than one A, so we will avoid adding another A for now.

We need a word of the form _ A N _ _. Choosing common letters that haven’t been ruled out gives many possibilities. “SANDY” fits the pattern, uses only new letters (S, D, Y) that haven’t been excluded, and respects the known A‑N placement.

Thus the next guess is:
