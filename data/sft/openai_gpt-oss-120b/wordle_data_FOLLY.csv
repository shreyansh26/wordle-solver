### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know O is correct at position 2. L is in the word but not at position 1, so it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. The letters C, R, A, N, E, U, D, S are all ruled out. The remaining usable letters are B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter word matching the pattern ? O ? ? ?, containing L somewhere after the first position. “JOLLY” fits perfectly:
- J (allowed) in position 1,
- O (✓) in position 2,
- L appears in positions 3 and 4 (consistent with L being in the word but not at position 1),
- Y (allowed) in position 5.

All letters are permissible and no eliminated letters are used. This makes “JOLLY” a strong next guess.

- L is not allowed at position 1 (from earlier feedback).

We have determined the secret word pattern from the feedback:

- Position 2 is O (✓ from guesses 2,3,4).
- Positions 3, 4, and 5 are L, L, Y (✓ from guess 3 and 4).
- Position 1 is still unknown.

Letters ruled out so far: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, S, J, H, and also L cannot be in position 1 (from the “L(-)” feedback on guess 2).  

Thus the secret word must be of the form _ O L L Y, with the first letter not being any of the eliminated letters and not L. Viable common English words fitting this pattern are:

- FOLLY
- GOLLY
- MOLLY
- POLLY

All these candidates use only letters not yet excluded. “FOLLY” is a common, non‑proper‑noun word, making it a strong next guess.
