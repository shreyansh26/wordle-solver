### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Therefore the secret word must contain R and E, placed elsewhere, and must avoid C, A, N. A good next guess should keep R and E in new positions while testing new letters.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed as R, E, E, L respectively.
- Position 3 is still unknown.
- Letters ruled out for the third position (and overall) are B, P, C, A, N, I, T, and any others from previous guesses.
- The remaining common letters that could occupy the third slot include V, D, G, H, K, M, O, Q, S, U, W, Y, Z, etc.
- The only common English word matching the pattern R E ? E L and using a letter not yet excluded is **REVEL** (with V in the third position).

Thus the next logical guess is REVEL.
