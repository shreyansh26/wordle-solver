### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and N, placed in different positions than those given. I need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and N, avoids C, R, and E, and tries new letters to gather more information. “SANTA” satisfies these conditions (A not in position 3, N not in position 4, and introduces S and T).

We have:
- From CRANE: C, R, E are not in the word; A and N are present but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- From SANTA: A at position 2 is correct (✓). N is in the word but not at position 3 (‑). The second A also exists elsewhere (‑). S, T are not in the word.

Thus the secret word contains at least two A’s, one at position 2, another not at position 5. It also contains N, which cannot be at position 3. No C, R, E, S, T.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **NAVAL**:
- N at position 1 (allowed)
- A at position 2 (✓)
- V at position 3 (new letter)
- A at position 4 (second A, not at position 5)
- L at position 5 (new letter)

This fits the known pattern and avoids all excluded letters.
