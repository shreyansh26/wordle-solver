### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give me useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should help identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Current constraints:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, M, O, T, B, S.
- Letter E is confirmed and must be in position 3 (feedback ✓ on the third letter of BLESS).
- Letter L is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (both received ‘-’). Therefore L can be in position 1 or 4.
- All other positions must avoid the excluded letters.

Choosing a word that satisfies these constraints and is a common English term, **YIELD** fits perfectly:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So the next guess should avoid C, R, A, N entirely, and place E somewhere other than the last slot. 
A good candidate is **MOTEL**: it uses new letters M, O, T, L and puts E in position 4, satisfying the known clue.

Thus we need a new word that includes E and L in allowed positions (E in 1‑3, L in 1‑4) and avoids the excluded letters.

We have deduced the word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = I (✓ from YIELD)
- Position 3 = E (✓ from BLESS and YIELD)
- Position 4 = L (✓ from YIELD)
- Position 5 = D (✓ from YIELD)

Thus the secret word is ? I E L D. The first letter is unknown but must not be any letter that received an “x” feedback in earlier guesses (C, R, A, N, M, O, T, B, S, Y). Common possibilities are F, W, H, etc. “FIELD” is a common English word fitting the pattern and uses a new letter F that hasn't been ruled out.

So the next guess will be FIELD.
