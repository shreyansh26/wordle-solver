2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a 5‑letter English word that begins with **SL** and does not contain any of the excluded letters.  
Possible candidates include:
- SLIMY (adds I, M, Y – all still unknown)
- SLOOP (contains O and O, but O repeats; still possible)
- SLING (contains N, which is excluded)

Among these, **SLIMY** fits the constraints and is a common word, so it will give useful information for the remaining three positions.

We have confirmed the first two letters and the last letter:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Eliminated letters (not in the word at any position): A, T, E, U, N, K, I, M, O, P.

We need a five‑letter word of the form **S L _ _ Y** using only letters that have not been eliminated for the third and fourth positions.  
A common English word that fits this pattern is **SLYLY** (S L Y L Y). It introduces the duplicate Y (to test if Y appears elsewhere) and a second L (to test if the word contains more than one L) while staying within the allowed letters.

Thus the next guess should be:
