### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- The letter **C** is in the word but not in position 1.
- Letters **R**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word at all.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Position 5 is E (✓).
- The secret contains the letter C, but not in positions 1 or 3 (‑ on those spots).
- The secret contains the letter E in at least one other position besides the final E, because the two other E’s in the guess EMCEE received “‑”. Therefore another E must be somewhere not in positions 1 or 4.
- Letters R, A, N, M are not in the word (all marked x).
- Position 1 cannot be E or C (both got “‑”). It must be a different letter.
- Position 2 could be C or the second E.
- Position 3 could be the second E but not C.
- Position 4 cannot be E (‑) but could be C.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **DEICE**:
- Pattern D E I C E → ends with E.
- Contains C at position 4 (allowed).
- Contains a second E at position 2 (allowed, not position 1 or 4).
- Uses letters D and I, which have not been ruled out.

Thus DEICE is a consistent next guess.
