### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback that the secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses.

- From ""SLATE"": A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5.
- From ""GAMER"": A is not in position 2, E is not in position 4.

Thus:
- A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

All other letters guessed (S, L, T, G, M, R) are confirmed absent.

We need a new word that includes A and E in allowed positions and introduces new letters to test.  
The word **KNEAD** fits:
- A is in position 4 (allowed) and E is in position 3 (allowed).
- New letters K, N, D have not been ruled out yet.

Therefore the next guess is KNEAD.

The word **KNEAD** fits:
- A is in position 4 (allowed) and E is in position 3 (allowed).
- New letters K, N, D have not been ruled out yet.

Therefore the next guess is KNEAD.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters:
- E is correct in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2,3,4 (from previous guesses). So A must be in position 1 or 5.

Excluded letters (not in the word): S, L, T, G, M, R, K, N, D.

Remaining possible letters are: B, C, F, H, I, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and E which we already know).

To discover the remaining three letters, we can guess a word that keeps E in the correct third position, includes A (even if placed incorrectly, we’ll get a “-” again), and introduces new allowable letters. “CHEAP” fits:
- C, H, P are new letters from the allowed set.
- It keeps E at position 3.
- A is placed at position 4, which we already know is wrong, so we’ll get a “-” for A, confirming the constraint.

Thus the next guess should be “CHEAP”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from previous feedback that the secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses.

- From ""SLATE"": A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5.
- From ""GAMER"": A is not in position 2, E is not in position 4.

Thus:
- A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

All other letters guessed (S, L, T, G, M, R) are confirmed absent.

We need a new word that includes A and E in allowed positions and introduces new letters to test.  
The word **KNEAD** fits:
- A is in position 4 (allowed) and E is in position 3 (allowed).
- New letters K, N, D have not been ruled out yet.

Therefore the next guess is KNEAD.
