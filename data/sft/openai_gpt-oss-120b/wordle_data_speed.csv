### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters L, A, T, K, I, N, H, D are not in the word.
- The second S in position 5 is not correct (feedback ""-""), so S cannot be at position 5.

Thus the secret pattern is **S _ E _ _**, with positions 2, 4, 5 needing new letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates are letters like P, R, M, W, etc.

A fitting word is **SPERM**:
- S is fixed at position 1.

- Positions 2, 4, 5 introduce three fresh letters (P, R, M) that are not excluded yet.

This guess will test those new letters while respecting all known constraints.

- E stays at position 3.
- Positions 2, 4, 5 introduce three fresh letters (P, R, M) that are not excluded yet.

This guess will test those new letters while respecting all known constraints.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 1 = **S** (✓ from all guesses).
- Position 2 = **P** (✓ from the fourth guess).
- Position 3 = **E** (✓ from the second and fourth guesses).
- Letters **R** and **M** are not in the word (x from the fourth guess).
- Letter **D** is in the word but not in position 4 (‑ from the third guess).
- Letter **S** is in the word but not in position 5 (‑ from the third guess). Since we already have an S in position 1, this just tells us the S we know isn’t at position 5.

Thus the pattern is **S P E _ _**, with the remaining letters needing to satisfy:
- One of them must be **D**, and it cannot be in position 4, so D must be at position 5.
- Position 4 cannot be D; it also cannot be any previously eliminated letters (L, A, T, K, I, N, H, R, M).

A common English word that fits these constraints is **SPEED** (S P E E D). It places D at position 5 (meeting the “D‑not‑position 4” rule) and uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be:
