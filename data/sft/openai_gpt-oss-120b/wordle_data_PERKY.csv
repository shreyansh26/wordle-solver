### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, U, L.
- Letter R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from guess1) and also NOT in position 5 (from guess2). Therefore R can only be in position 3 or 4, but position 4 currently holds E in guess2, so R must be in **position 3**.
- Letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from guess2) and NOT in position 5 (from guess1). Hence E can be in position 1 or 2. Since position 3 is taken by R, the remaining slots are 1 and 2.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
- Position 3 = R
- Position 1 or 2 = E
- The other of positions 1‑2, plus positions 4‑5 are letters not yet ruled out (cannot be C, A, N, U, L).

A good next guess should keep E and R in allowed spots and introduce new letters to test.  
Choosing **DERBY** gives:
- D (new) at position 1  
- E (required) at position 2  
- R (required) at position 3  
- B (new) at position 4  
- Y (new) at position 5  

This respects all constraints and checks four new letters.
