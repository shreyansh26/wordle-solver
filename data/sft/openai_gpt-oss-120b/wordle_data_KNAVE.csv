### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a variety of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a frequent opening guess in these games because it tests two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give us useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 4, so N must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters C and R are not in the word.

We need a five‑letter word matching the pattern _ _ A _ E with N at position 1 or 2. “SNAKE” fits:
- S (new letter)
- N at position 2 (satisfies N’s presence and wrong position from earlier)
- A at position 3 (✓)
- K (new letter)
- E at position 5 (✓)

Thus “SNAKE” is a valid next guess.

We have:
- From Guess 1 (CRANE): A is correct at position 3, E is correct at position 5, N is in the word but not position 4, C and R are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (SNAKE): N is correct at position 2, A still correct at 3, E correct at 5, K is in the word but not position 4, S is not in the word, and K’s wrong‑position signal tells us K must be elsewhere.
Because position 2 is already N and position 3 is A, K cannot be at 2 or 3. It also cannot be at 4 (the place it was guessed), so K must be at position 1.
Thus we have:
1 = K, 2 = N, 3 = A, 5 = E, and position 4 is still unknown.
The only remaining unknown letter must not be C, R, S (ruled out) and can be any other letter. A common English word fitting the pattern K N A _ E is **KNAVE** (K N A V E).

This satisfies all known constraints, so we guess that word.
