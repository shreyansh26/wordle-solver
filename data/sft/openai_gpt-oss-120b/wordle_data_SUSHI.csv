### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word in Wordle because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I’ll use that as my first guess.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need a new five‑letter guess that avoids all of those letters. Choosing a common word with different letters will give more information. “MIGHT” (M, I, G, H, T) uses none of the excluded letters, so it’s a valid next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C,R,A,N,E,M,G,T are not in the word (x).
- Letter H is correct and in position 4 (✓).
- Letter I is in the word but not in position 2 (‑).

Thus the secret word must have H at the fourth slot, contain I somewhere other than the second slot, and avoid the excluded letters.

A five‑letter word that fits these constraints is **SUSHI**:
- Pattern _: _: _: H _: (H in fourth position)
- I is in fifth position, not second.
- Uses only allowed letters (S, U, H, I) and no excluded letters.

So “SUSHI” is a valid next guess.
