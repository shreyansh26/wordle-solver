### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed letters from previous feedback:
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Letters known not to be in the word: C, A, N, E, F, U, I, T, P, W, L, G, K.

Remaining possible letters for the unknown positions (1 and 4) are: B, D, H, J, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z, and also S could appear again.

A common English word that fits the pattern _ R O _ S and uses only allowed letters is **DROSS** (D R O S S). It places an allowed letter D in position 1 and repeats S in position 4, which is still possible.

Thus the next guess should be:
