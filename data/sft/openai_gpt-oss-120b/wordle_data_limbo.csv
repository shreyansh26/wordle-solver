### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From previous feedback:
- CRANE: all letters C,R,A,N,E are not in the secret word.
- SHOUT: S, H, U, T are not in the word; O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).

Therefore the secret word must contain the letter O somewhere other than the third slot, and cannot contain any of the excluded letters {C,R,A,N,E,S,H,U,T}. I need a 5‑letter English word meeting these constraints.

""JOLLY"" fits:
- Contains O in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses only letters J, O, L, Y, none of which are excluded.
- Is a valid common word.

Thus I will guess ""JOLLY"".

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that contains O in an allowed position (1, 4, or 5) and uses only allowed letters otherwise.

From the feedback:

- Guess 4 (BIMBO): B(-) I(✓) M(✓) B(✓) O(✓)
  - B is in the word but not at position 1; it is correct at position 4.
  - I is correct at position 2.
  - M is correct at position 3.
  - O is correct at position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ I M B O.

From earlier feedback (JOLLY): L was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4. The only remaining slot is position 1, which fits.

Therefore the secret word should be **LIMBO**. Guessing it will solve the puzzle.
