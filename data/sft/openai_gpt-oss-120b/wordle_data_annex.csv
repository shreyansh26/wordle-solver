### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- C, R, E, B, D, Y are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- N is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ N _ _.  
A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  

Choosing a word that keeps N at position 3, puts A at a new spot (position 4), and introduces fresh letters avoids excluded ones.  
""TONAL"" fits: T O N A L (N third, A fourth, no excluded letters). It also lets us test T, O, and L.

So the next guess is ""TONAL"".

- N is correct at position 3.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier feedback). So A can be at position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, B, D, Y, T, O, L (all marked x).

We need a word of pattern _ _ N _ _. With A at either first or fifth spot.

Choosing A at position 5 gives pattern __N_A. We look for a valid English word with N third, A fifth, and no prohibited letters. ""PINNA"" (ear anatomy) fits:
- P I N N A
- N is third, A is fifth.
- Letters P and I have not been ruled out.
Thus ""PINNA"" is a good next guess.

We have determined:
- Position 1 must be A (A was marked ‘-’ in earlier guesses, eliminating positions 2‑5).
- Position 3 is N (green from guesses 2 and 3).  
- The N in position 4 of guess 4 received a ‘-’, meaning the secret contains another N but not at position 4. Therefore the secret has at least two Ns. The second N can be at position 2 or 5.

Thus the pattern is either **A N N _ _** (second N at position 2) or **A _ N _ N** (second N at position 5).

Looking at the allowed letters (all letters marked “x” are excluded: C,R,E,B,D,Y,T,O,L,P,I and also the already‑used letters A,N), the remaining viable letters are F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

A common English word that fits the **A N N _ _** pattern using only allowed letters is **ANNUM** (A N N U M). This places the extra N in position 2, introduces the new letters U and M (still unknown), and respects all previous constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be “ANNUM”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word, but A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

We need a new guess that includes A and N in different positions, avoids the excluded letters, and tests new letters.

The word **BANDY** fits:
- Contains A (position 2) and N (position 3), satisfying the position constraints.
- Does not contain C, R, or E.
- Introduces new letters B, D, and Y to gather more information.

A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  

Choosing a word that keeps N at position 3, puts A at a new spot (position 4), and introduces fresh letters avoids excluded ones.  
""TONAL"" fits: T O N A L (N third, A fourth, no excluded letters). It also lets us test T, O, and L.

The only common English words that fit the A N N _ _ pattern are limited (e.g., ANNOY, ANNUL, ANNEX), but many of those contain letters already ruled out. To continue gathering information, I will guess a word that keeps the known prefix “ANN” and introduces new letters that have not yet been tested, even if some may have been ruled out previously. “ANNEX” is a common word and adds the letters E and X for further clues.
