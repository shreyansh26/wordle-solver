### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I want to start with a common, information‑rich starter word that contains a mix of frequent vowels and consonants. “CRANE” includes two of the most common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), giving a good chance to uncover letters and positions early on.

From the first guess (CRANE) I learned:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, excludes C, A, N, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot. A common word that satisfies these constraints is **LEVER** (L‑E‑V‑E‑R). It contains R (at position 5) and two E’s (positions 2 and 4), avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

From the feedback:

- The secret word ends with **R** (position 5) and has **E** in position 4.
- It contains **L**, but not in position 1.
- It contains a second **E** (since the first E in “LEVER” got a yellow), which cannot be in position 2 (the place it was guessed) and also cannot be position 4 (already occupied). So the extra E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Excluded letters are C, A, N, V and any others not yet confirmed.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **ELDER**:
- Pattern ? ? ? E R → E L D E R fits.
- L is in position 2 (not position 1).
- There are two E’s (positions 1 and 4).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus “ELDER” is a valid next guess.
