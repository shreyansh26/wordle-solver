We know from the feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- Letters S, L, T are not in the word at all.
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (‑).

So we need a 5‑letter word with A fixed at the third spot, containing E somewhere other than the fifth position, and avoiding S, L, and T.

A good candidate is **BEACH**:
- B E A C H
- A is in the correct third position.
- E is in the second position (not fifth).
- No S, L, or T appear.

Thus we will guess BEACH.

We determined the secret word pattern is ?EACH:

- Position 3 is A (✓)
- Position 4 is C (✓)
- Position 5 is H (✓)
- Position 1 cannot be B (from BEACH), S, L, or T (from SLATE). Viable common words fitting this pattern are **PEACH** and **REACH**. Both are possible, so we need to test one.
Choosing **PEACH** as the next guess will confirm if the first letter is P or if we need to try REACH next.
