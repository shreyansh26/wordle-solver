### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E, containing R and A somewhere other than their original spots (R ≠ position2, A ≠ position3). A good next guess keeps E at the end, places R and A in new positions, and introduces two new letters to gather more information. “RAISE” fits: R at position 1, A at position 2, and adds I and S as new letters while keeping E at position 5.
