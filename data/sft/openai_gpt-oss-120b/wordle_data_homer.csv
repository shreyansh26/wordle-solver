### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 3 “ROPER” gave:  
  - Position 1: R (‑) → R is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - Position 2: O (✓) → O is correct at position 2.  
  - Position 3: P (x) → P is not in the word.  
  - Position 4: E (✓) → E is correct at position 4.  
  - Position 5: R (✓) → R is correct at position 5.

Since we already have a green R at position 5, the “‑” at position 1 means the word contains **another R** elsewhere (not position 1). The only remaining slot that can hold this second R is position 3.

Thus the secret word pattern is:

1 ? , 2 O, 3 R, 4 E, 5 R → “? O R E R”.

A common English word matching this pattern is **SORER** (meaning “more sore”). It uses only letters not ruled out so far (S has not been tried).

Therefore the next logical guess is “SORER”.

- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions from the previous guess, and avoids C, A, N.  
A good candidate is **BERTH**:
- Contains E (now in position 2, allowed) and R (position 3, allowed).
- Uses only new letters B, T, H besides the known ones.
- No C, A, N present.

Thus this guess will test the placements of R and E while introducing three fresh letters.

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, B, T, H.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 (CRANE) or 3 (BERTH); thus R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- E is in the word but not in positions 5 (CRANE) or 2 (BERTH); thus E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes R and E in allowed positions and avoids all excluded letters.  
The word **ROPER** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) – both allowed.
- Contains E at position 4 – allowed.
- Uses only new letters O and P, which have not been ruled out.
Thus it will test the placements of R and E while introducing fresh letters.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Guess 3 “ROPER” gave:  
  - Position 1: R (‑) → R is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - Position 2: O (✓) → O is correct at position 2.  
  - Position 3: P (x) → P is not in the word.  
  - Position 4: E (✓) → E is correct at position 4.  
  - Position 5: R (✓) → R is correct at position 5.

Since we already have a green R at position 5, the “‑” at position 1 means the word contains **another R** elsewhere (not position 1). The only remaining slot that can hold this second R is position 3.

Thus the secret word pattern is:

1 ? , 2 O, 3 R, 4 E, 5 R → “? O R E R”.

A common English word matching this pattern is **SORER** (meaning “more sore”). It uses only letters not ruled out so far (S has not been tried).

Therefore the next logical guess is “SORER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
