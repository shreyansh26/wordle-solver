### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that only the letter R from “crane” is in the secret word, but it is not in the second position. The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. So the next guess must contain R (not in position 2) and avoid C, A, N, E. I’ll choose a common word that fits: “BLURT”. It has R in the fourth position and none of the disallowed letters.

We have discovered the exact positions of three letters:
- L is correct at position 2 (from “blurt” → L✓).
- R is correct at position 4 (from “blurt” → R✓).
- T is correct at position 5 (from “blurt” → T✓).

All other letters guessed so far are not in the word:
C, A, N, E, B, U, and also the first‑position B from “blurt”.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ L _ R T.

We need a common English word fitting that pattern, using letters we haven’t ruled out. “FLIRT” matches perfectly: F L I R T, with F and I not yet excluded.

Hence the next logical guess is “flirt”.
