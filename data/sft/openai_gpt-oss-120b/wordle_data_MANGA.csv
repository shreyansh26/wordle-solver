### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters from the feedback:
- Position 1: M (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 5: A (✓)
- Position 4 cannot be I (x) and cannot be any letters previously marked x: C, R, E, B, L, S, T, I.

Thus the word pattern is **M A N _ A** with the fourth letter unknown but not among the excluded letters. A common English word fitting this pattern is **MANGA** (M A N G A), where G has not been ruled out.

I'll guess ""MANGA"".
