### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first feedback: C, A, N are not in the secret word. R and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5). Our next guess must therefore:
- Exclude C, A, N.
- Include R and E, placing them in different positions than before.
- Use other common letters to test new possibilities.

A good candidate is **SERVE**:
- Contains R (now in position 3) and E (positions 2 and 5, moving E away from position 5).
- Introduces new letters S and V for additional information.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, N.

Thus I will guess “SERVE”.

We have the following information from the feedback:

- Letters **C, A, N, S, V** are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letters **R** and **E** are in the word (marked - in the first guess) and are now placed correctly (✓) in the second guess:
  - **E** is correct at position 2.
  - **R** is correct at position 3.
- The second “E” at position 5 received a “-”, meaning an **E** exists elsewhere but not at position 5, which reinforces that the only E should stay in position 2.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: **_ E R _ _** (positions 1, 4, 5 still unknown).  
We must avoid the letters C, A, N, S, V and we can use any other common letters.

A good candidate that matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **MERIT** (M‑E‑R‑I‑T).
