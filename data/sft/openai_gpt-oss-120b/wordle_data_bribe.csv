### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Excluded letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, M.  

The pattern is: _ R I _ E  

We need a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters for positions 1 and 4 to gather more information. “PRIDE” matches the pattern, introduces P at position 1 and D at position 4 (both not yet tested), and keeps the known correct letters in place. It also contains only allowed letters.

Thus the next guess is “PRIDE”.

We have determined the pattern B R I _ E, with N excluded from position 4. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **BRIBE**, which places B in the fourth position to test whether the word contains a second B.
