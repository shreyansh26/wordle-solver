### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the first guess:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct and in the second position.
- A is correct and in the third position.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word must be of the form _ R A _ _. We need a common English word that fits this pattern and does not contain C, N, or E. “GRASP” satisfies all constraints (G‑R‑A‑S‑P) and uses only new letters for the unknown positions.

We have the following feedback:

1. From **CRANE**:  
   - C ❌, R ✅ (position 2), A ✅ (position 3), N ❌, E ❌.  
   So the pattern is _ R A _ _.

2. From **GRASP**:  
   - G ✅ (position 1), R ✅ (position 2), A ✅ (position 3), S ❌, P ⚪ (present but wrong position).  
   Since positions 1‑3 are fixed as G‑R‑A, the only remaining spots are 4 and 5.  
   P cannot be in position 5 (it was guessed there), so P must be in position 4.  

Thus the word now looks like **G R A P _**.  
The only common English word that fits this pattern and uses a new letter for the final spot is **GRAPH** (with H in the fifth position). H has not been ruled out yet.

So the next logical guess is:
