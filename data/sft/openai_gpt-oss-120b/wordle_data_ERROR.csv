### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- R is correct and must stay in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1‑4.

For the next guess we need:
1. R fixed at the second spot.
2. Include E in a different position (not 5) to test where it belongs.
3. Introduce new letters to explore the remaining unknown spots while avoiding C, A, N.

A good candidate is **PREST**:
- Pattern: P R E S T (R stays at position 2, E moves to position 3).
- New letters P, S, T give fresh information.
- No forbidden letters (C, A, N) are used.

Thus we will guess “PREST”.
