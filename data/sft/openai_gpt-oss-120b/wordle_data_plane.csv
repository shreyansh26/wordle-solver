I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A common, vowel‑rich word works well for gathering information, so I’ll choose **CRANE**.

We know the secret word has A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th. The first two letters cannot be C or R (and must form a valid English word). “PLANE” fits the pattern _ _ A N E and uses none of the excluded letters, so it’s a strong next guess.
