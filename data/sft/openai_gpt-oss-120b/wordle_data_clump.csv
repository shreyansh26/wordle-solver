### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes the vowel **A** and **E**, and three frequently used consonants **C**, **R**, and **N**. This should give useful information about vowel placement and common letters for the next steps.

The first letter is confirmed as C. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. I need a new 5‑letter word starting with C and avoiding those letters. “COUCH” fits: C O U C H uses only allowed letters and keeps C in the first position.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is C (C ✓).
- Position 3 is U (U ✓).
- Letters R, A, N, E, O, H are not in the word (x).
- The second C in the guess “COUCH” was marked “-”, meaning a C appears elsewhere, but the rules don’t clarify duplicate handling, so we can’t be certain there’s a second C. We’ll assume only the first C is confirmed for now.

Thus the pattern is **C _ U _ _**, and we must avoid the excluded letters. A common word fitting this pattern and using only new letters is **CLUMP** (C L U M P). This will test new letters L, M, and P and also confirm whether a second C exists later.
