### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word ends with **E** (position 5). All other letters from the first two guesses are not in the word: C, R, A, N, M, O, U, S. So the remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding those eight letters.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in **E** that uses only letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates include:
- **GLIDE** (G, L, I, D, E)
- **WHILE** (W, H, I, L, E)
- **BIBLE** (B, I, L, E)
- **DIPED** (not common)

**WHILE** uses four new letters (W, H, I, L) none of which have been eliminated, and it ends with E, matching the known correct position. This should give us maximal new information.

Therefore, we guess **WHILE**.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have the following feedback so far:

- Position 5 is definitely **E** (✓ from all guesses).
- Letters **L** and **E** appear elsewhere in the word:
  * From WHILE, L is present but not in position 4.
  * From PLEBE, L is present but not in position 2; thus L cannot be 2 or 4, leaving positions 1 or 3.
  * From PLEBE, the E in position 3 got a “-”, meaning there is another E in the word that is not at position 3. Since we already know there is an E at position 5, this implies the secret word contains **at least two E’s**.
- All other letters tried (C,R,A,N,M,O,U,S,W,H,I,P,B) are not in the word.

Remaining possible letters (not ruled out) include: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z and of course E.

We need a common 5‑letter word that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Contains **L** in position 1 or 3 (cannot be 2 or 4).
3. Contains a second **E** somewhere other than position 5 (and not at position 3, per the “-” on that guess).

A word that satisfies all constraints is **LEVEE**:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- E appears at positions 2, 4, 5 (giving the required extra E’s).
- No prohibited letters are used; V is still untested.

Thus “LEVEE” is a strong next guess to test the remaining possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have determined the following from the feedback:

- Position 1 = L (correct from LEVEE).
- Position 2 = E (correct from LEVEE).
- Position 5 = E (consistent from all guesses).
- Position 4 is not E and not V (V was marked absent).
- Position 3 is still unknown, but cannot be any letters that have been marked absent: C, R, A, N, M, O, U, S, W, H, I, P, B, V, and also cannot be L unless the word has a second L (possible but not required).

Thus the pattern is **L E _ _ E** with the fourth letter not E and not V.

A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out is **LEDGE**:

- D (pos3) – new, not tested
