### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position from guess 1 (CRANE):
  * R is not in position 2.
  * A is not in position 3.
  * E is not in position 5.
We need a new five‑letter word that includes R, A, and E, avoids C and N, and places those letters in different slots.

A good candidate is **ALERT**:
- Contains A, L, E, R, T – all required letters are present.
- A is in position 1 (different from position 3 in guess 1).
- R is in position 4 (different from position 2).
- E is in position 3 (different from position 5).
- No C or N appear.

Thus, ALERT satisfies all constraints and will give us more information.

This should give me a solid baseline for the first feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position from guess 1 (CRANE):
  * R is not in position 2.
  * A is not in position 3.
  * E is not in position 5.
We need a new five‑letter word that includes R, A, and E, avoids C and N, and places those letters in different slots.

A good candidate is **ALERT**:
- Contains A, L, E, R, T – all required letters are present.
- A is in position 1 (different from position 3 in guess 1).
- R is in position 4 (different from position 2).
- E is in position 3 (different from position 5).
- No C or N appear.

Thus, ALERT satisfies all constraints and will give us more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ALERT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have letters present: A, E, L, R (each indicated as '-' meaning present but wrong spot). Unknown fifth letter. Excluded letters: C, N, T. Position constraints:
- R not in positions 2 or 4.
- A not in positions 1 or 3.
- E not in positions 3 or 5.
- L not in position 2.
Choosing a word that includes A, E, L, R plus another letter, respecting these constraints, leads to ""LAYER"": L(1) A(2) Y(3) E(4) R(5). 
Check:
- R at 5 → not 2 or 4 ✔
- A at 2 → not 1 or 3 ✔
- E at 4 → not 3 or 5 ✔
- L at 1 → not 2 ✔
All letters are allowed, and Y is not excluded. So ""LAYER"" is a valid next guess.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ALERT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)
Guess 3: LAYER -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) Y(x) E(-) R(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have letters known to be in the word: A, L, E, R. Excluded letters: C, N, T, Y. Position constraints gathered from feedback:

- A cannot be in positions 1,2,3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- L cannot be in positions 1,2 → possible positions 3,4,5.
- E cannot be in positions 3,4,5 → possible positions 1 or 2.
- R cannot be in positions 2,4,5 → possible positions 1 or 3.

Choose placements satisfying all:
- Put E at position 2 (allowed).
- Put R at position 1 (allowed).
- Put L at position 3 (allowed).
- Put A at position 4 (allowed).
- Position 5 can be any unused letter not excluded; “X” works.

This forms the word **RELAX**, which meets every constraint and is a common English word.

Thus the next guess should be RELAX.

We have determined the known letters and their positions:
- Position 2 = E (correct)
- Position 4 = A (correct)

Letters that must appear but are not in the positions shown in the last guess (RELAX):
- R is present but cannot be at position 1.
- L is present but cannot be at position 3.

Thus R can be at positions 3 or 5, and L can be at positions 1 or 5.  
The remaining unknown slot (position 1 or 3 or 5) must be filled with a letter that has not been excluded (C, N, T, Y, X, etc.).

A word that satisfies all constraints is **FERAL**:
- Pattern: F E R A L
- E is in position 2, A is in position 4 (both correct).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- L is in position 5 (allowed, not position 3).
- F is a new letter not yet ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""FERAL"".
