### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- R is correct at position 3 (from WORCS).
- C is in the word but not at positions 1, 4 (from CRANE and WORCS). So C can be at position 2 or 5.
- Letters A, N, E, W, O, S are not in the word.

A good next guess should keep R in position 3, place C at one of its possible spots, and introduce new letters to test possibilities.  
Choosing the word **ACRID** gives:
- A (known to be absent) – will confirm it’s still absent.
- C at position 2 (one of the allowed spots for C).
- R at position 3 (keeps the known correct placement).
- Introduces I and D, new letters we haven’t tested.

This guess will tell us whether C belongs at position 2 (if it gets a “✓”) or must be at position 5, and will also indicate if I or D appear in the solution.
