### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:

- L is present but not in position 1 (from LOUDS feedback L(-)).
Thus the secret word must contain L somewhere other than the first slot, and must avoid all eliminated letters.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter word using only these letters and placing L not in the first position. “BLITZ” fits:
- Contains only allowed letters (B, L, I, T, Z).
- L is in the second position, satisfying the “wrong position” requirement.

We have deduced the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = I (✓ from MILKY)
- Position 3 = L (✓ from MILKY)
- Position 5 = Y (✓ from MILKY)

Thus the secret word looks like: _ I L _ Y.

Eliminated letters (marked x) are: C, R, A, N, E, O, U, D, S, B, T, Z, M, K, and also L cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (but we already placed L at 3). The remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are among {F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, etc.}. 

A common English word fitting the pattern is **HILLY** (H I L L Y), using allowed letters and placing L also at position 4, which is permissible. This will test the new letter H and confirm if a double L is correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
