### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have established fixed letters: position 2 = L, position 3 = A, position 5 = E.  
Excluded letters (not in the secret word) are: C, R, N, G, D.  

The pattern is _ L A _ E.  
Possible common words fitting this pattern and avoiding excluded letters include:
- BLAME (B L A M E)
- FLAME (F L A M E)
- PLATE (P L A T E)
- SLATE (S L A T E)

Choosing a word that tests two new letters at once is efficient. “PLATE” introduces P (position 1) and T (position 4), both untried, while still matching the known pattern.

Thus the next guess will be PLATE.

We have deduced the known pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = L (from all guesses).
- Position 3 = A (consistent).
- Position 4 = M (from BLAME where M got a ✓).
- Position 5 = E (always correct).

Thus the secret word is of the form _ L A M E.

Letters confirmed absent: C, R, N, G, D, P, T, B (all got x).  
We need a valid English word matching _LAME with a new first letter not in the excluded list.

Possible candidates: FLAME, SLAME (not common), GLAME (not a word). ""FLAME"" fits perfectly and introduces F, which hasn't been tested yet.

So the next guess should be FLAME.
