### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- A is correct in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 → possible positions 1, 2, or 4.
- S and L are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Has A in the third slot.
- Includes both T and E in allowed positions.
- Avoids S and L.

The word **MEANT** fits:
- Pattern: M E A N T → A is third.
- Contains T (position 5, allowed) and E (position 2, allowed).
- No S or L present.

Thus the next guess is “MEANT”.
