### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in the fourth position (the position it occupied in ""CRANE""). Therefore, the next guess must include N in a different position and avoid using C, R, A, or E altogether. I’ll choose a common word that meets these criteria, such as “NUMBS,” which places N at the first position and uses letters U, M, B, and S that have not been ruled out.

We have determined the secret word starts with N (position 1) and U (position 2). Letters C, R, A, E, M, B, S are excluded. We need a word matching pattern ""NU___"" using only letters not ruled out. A common valid word is **NUTTY** (N U T T Y), which introduces new letters T and Y and repeats T, which is allowed unless already disproven.
