2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes C, R, A, N, and E, covering common consonants and a vowel.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A and N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain the letters C, R, and E, placed in different spots than those shown. I need a new 5‑letter word that includes C, R, and E, avoids A and N, and respects the positional restrictions.  

The word **RELIC** fits:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it can’t be in position 2).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in position 5).
- C is in position 5 (allowed, since it can’t be in position 1).
- The other letters L and I are new guesses.

Thus “RELIC” is a good next guess.
