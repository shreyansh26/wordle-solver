### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful feedback. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, or “ARISE” are popular first guesses in word‑guessing games. I’ll choose “CRANE” because it contains three frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should give a good spread of information about the secret word.

We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C and R are not in the word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position.
Positions from CRANE:
1:C 2:R 3:A 4:N 5:E

Thus:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- No C or R anywhere.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E respecting those position constraints and avoids C and R. The word **PANEL** fits:
- Contains A (position 2, not 3)
- Contains N (position 3, not 4)
- Contains E (position 4, not 5)
- No C or R present.

So PANEL is a good next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C and R are not in the word; A, N, E are present but in wrong positions (A≠3, N≠4, E≠5).
- From PANEL: P is correct at position 1; A is present but not at position 2; N is correct at position 3; E is present but not at position 4; L is correct at position 5.

Thus the word pattern is:
1 = P (fixed)
3 = N (fixed)
5 = L (fixed)

The remaining letters are A and E, and the remaining slots are positions 2 and 4.

Constraints:
- A cannot be at position 2 (from PANEL) and cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE), so A must be at position 4.
- Therefore E must occupy position 2. This also respects earlier constraints (E not at 4 or 5).

Putting it together gives the word **PENAL**, which satisfies all feedback.

Now we guess that word.
