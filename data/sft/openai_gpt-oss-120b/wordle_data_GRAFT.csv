We have established that the first three letters are G, R, A. The letters that have been marked as not in the word are: C, N, E, S, P, I, L, V, Y. Therefore the remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5 are any letters not in that excluded list. A common word that fits the pattern G R A _ _ and avoids the excluded letters is ""GRAFT"" (G R A F T). Both F and T have not been ruled out, and ""GRAFT"" is a valid English word.
