### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess “CRANE” indicates that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I’ll choose a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out. “SHOUT” contains S, H, O, U, and T, all of which are permissible based on the current information.

We have confirmed S is correct at position 1 and T at position 5. In SPLIT, I got a “-”, meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore I can be in position 2 or 3.

The word **SWIFT** fits: S (position 1 correct), W (new), I (position 3, not position 4), F (new), T (position 5 correct). All letters are allowed.
