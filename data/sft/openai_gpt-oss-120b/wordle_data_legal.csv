### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess “crane” we learned:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E, places A somewhere other than the 3rd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot, and avoids C, R, N. 

“BLEAT” fits:
- Contains A (position 4) and E (position 3), both not in the forbidden spots.
- Uses only letters B, L, T besides A and E, none of which were ruled out.
Thus it’s a valid next guess.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- From “crane”: C, R, N are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 3. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From “bleat”: B and T are not in the word. L is in the word but not in position 2. E is in the word but not in position 3. A is correct in position 4.

So far we know:
- Position 4 = **A** (confirmed).
- **E** is somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5; it can be position 1 or 2.
- **L** is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2; it can be position 1, 3, or 5.
- The letters C, R, N, B, T are excluded.

We need a valid English word that satisfies these constraints.  
The word **LEGAL** fits perfectly:
- L is in position 1 (allowed) and also appears again in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed; not 3 or 5).
- A is in position 4 (already confirmed).
- The remaining letter G has not been ruled out.

Thus “legal” is a legal next guess that utilizes the known letters and avoids the excluded ones.
