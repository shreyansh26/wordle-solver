### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants, which will give me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “ARISE” is a good starter because it includes three of the most common vowels (A, I, E) and two frequent consonants (R, S). This should help identify which letters are present and where they might belong.

From the feedback, only the letter A is present in the secret word, but it is not in the first position. The letters R, I, S, and E are not in the word at all. I need a new guess that includes A somewhere other than the first slot and uses other letters that haven't been ruled out. “MANGO” places A in the second position and introduces new letters M, N, G, O, which are all still possible.
