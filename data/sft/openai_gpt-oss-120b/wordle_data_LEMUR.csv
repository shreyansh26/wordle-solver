### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The word **RELIT** fits:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- L, I, T are new letters not yet ruled out.

So we guess RELIT.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from prior feedback:

- Eliminated letters (cannot appear): C, A, N, S, H, D, I, T.
- E is confirmed at position 2 (E ✓) and cannot be at positions 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 → R must be at position 4 or 5.
- L is in the word but not at position 3 → L can be at positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 because E occupies that spot).

Thus we need a 5‑letter word with pattern **_ E _ _ _**, containing both **L** and **R** in the allowable spots, and using only letters not eliminated.

The word **LEERY** fits perfectly:
- Position 1 = L (allowed for L)
- Position 2 = E (confirmed)
- Position 3 = E (allowed; E is not prohibited from position 3)
- Position 4 = R (R allowed at 4)
- Position 5 = Y (a new, still‑possible letter)

All constraints are satisfied, so we will guess **LEERY**.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 4 cannot be E (from SHRED feedback) and cannot be R (from LEERY feedback). 

All eliminated letters so far are: C, A, N, S, H, D, I, T, Y.

We need a word of the form **L E _ _ R** using only letters not yet excluded.
