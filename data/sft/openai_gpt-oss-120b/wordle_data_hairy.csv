### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked x).
- R and A are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in CRANE: R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters R and A, placed in any other positions, and the remaining three letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding C, N, and E.

A common five‑letter word that satisfies these constraints is **RAILS**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not position 3).
- I, L, S are new letters that have not been ruled out yet.

So “RAILS” is a logical next guess.
