### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Choosing a word that introduces new letters helps narrow down the solution. “PROSE” tests two new letters (P, S) while keeping the known structure.

We have confirmed letters: R in position 2, O in position 3, E in position 5. Excluded letters: C, A, N, B, I, D, G, V, P, S. We need a word of pattern _ R O _ E. Good candidates are ""WROTE"" (introducing W and T) and ""FROZE"" (introducing F and Z). Both use only new letters. I will guess ""WROTE"" to test W and T.
