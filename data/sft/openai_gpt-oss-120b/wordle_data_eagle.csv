### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- **FABLE** (F A B L E)
- **BADGE** (B A D G E)
- **LATHE** (L A T H E)

All three satisfy the pattern and use only letters we haven’t ruled out. Choosing a word that introduces new letters helps gather information, so **FABLE** is a solid next guess.

- Position 5 = E (✓ from CRANE, PAUSE, FABLE)

All other letters from previous guesses are excluded:
Excluded letters = {C, R, N, P, U, S, F, B, G? actually G not yet excluded, but keep list: C,R,N,P,U,S,F,B}.  

Pattern is: _ A _ L E  

We need a common 5‑letter word matching ""?A?LE"" that does not use any excluded letters.  
A suitable word is **DAWLE** (D A W L E): D and W have not been ruled out, and the word fits the pattern.

Thus the next guess should be DAWLE.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = A (green)
- Position 4 = L (green)
- Position 5 = E (green)

All other guessed letters are marked absent: C, R, N, P, U, S, F, B, D, W.

Thus the hidden word matches the pattern: _ A _ L E, using none of the excluded letters.

We need a common English word fitting that pattern. “EAGLE” fits perfectly:
- Position 1 = E (E is already green at 5, but duplicates are allowed until proven otherwise)
- Position 2 = A (matches green)
- Position 3 = G (new, not excluded)
- Position 4 = L (matches green)
- Position 5 = E (matches green)

All letters are permissible, and the guess introduces a new letter G while reusing allowed letters.

Therefore the next guess should be **EAGLE**.
