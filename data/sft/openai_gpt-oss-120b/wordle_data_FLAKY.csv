### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2: L (✓ from PLAZA)
- Position 3: A (✓ from all guesses)
- Position 5 cannot be A (‑ from PLAZA) and L is not at 5 (‑ from QUAIL)
- L is not at position 5, and we already have it at position 2.
- Excluded letters (marked x): C,R,N,E,S,M,H,Q,U,I,P,Z.
- L is confirmed at position 2, A at position 3.
Remaining possible letters for positions 1,4,5 are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, J, K, O, T, V, W, X, Y.

We need a common 5‑letter English word of the form _ L A _ _. “FLAKY” fits:
- F (allowed) L (position2) A (position3) K (allowed) Y (allowed)
- No excluded letters are present.

Thus the next guess should be FLAKY.
