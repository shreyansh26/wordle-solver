### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather useful information. “CRANE” includes two frequent vowels (A, E) and a mix of common consonants (C, R, N). This should give a good spread for the first feedback.

From the first feedback:
- R is correct at position 2.
- A is correct at position 3.
- C, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like _ R A _ _. I need to test new letters for the remaining slots while keeping R and A fixed. A good candidate is **GRASP**: it keeps R and A in place and introduces G, S, and P, none of which have been ruled out.
