### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements, which will give useful information for the next guesses. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E) spread across the word. This should reveal a lot about the secret word’s letters and positions.

From the feedback:

- The letter **I** at position 2 is correct (✓).
- The second I in the guess was marked ""-"", meaning I appears elsewhere, but since we already have I in the correct spot, we’ll treat the secret word as having a single I at position 2 (the extra – could be a quirk of the feedback system).

We have determined:
- Position 5 is confirmed as E.
- Position 2 is confirmed as I (green).
- All letters S, L, A, T, C, R, M, P, X, H, N, G are ruled out.
- The feedback for the second I in ""PIXIE"" was a yellow, suggesting there is only one I (already placed at position 2); no other I is required.
Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ I _ _ E, using only letters not yet excluded.

A common English word matching this pattern and using only allowed letters is **DIODE** (D I O D E). It respects all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is DIODE.
