### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letter T is in the word but not in position 2; it must be either position 4 or 5.
- Letters C, R, N, E, G, L, M, P are not in the word.

We need a word of the form S _ A _ _. Placing T in position 4 gives the pattern S _ A T _. A valid English word that fits and uses only allowed letters is **SWATH** (S‑W‑A‑T‑H). This tests the unknown letters W and H while putting T in position 4, which aligns with the known constraints.
