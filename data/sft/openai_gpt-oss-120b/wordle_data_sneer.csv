### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined from the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 2 is N (✓).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1‑4, so it must be position 5.
- Letters C, A, E, U, Y, O, T, H are not in the word.

The pattern is therefore **S N _ _ R**.  
We need to discover the two middle letters. To test possibilities while keeping the known letters fixed, a good next guess is a valid English word that keeps S and N in place, puts R at the end, and introduces new letters to evaluate. The word **SNIDE** fits: S N I D E (E will be marked absent, which is fine, and we’ll learn whether I and D belong in positions 3‑4).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N in different positions, avoids C, A, E, and introduces new letters to test. “RUNNY” satisfies:
- Contains R (position 1) → not position 2, so okay.
- Contains N (positions 2 and 3) → not position 4, so okay.
- Uses only new letters U, Y besides R and N, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus “RUNNY” is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have two letters confirmed present: R and N.
Feedback tells us:
- R is not in position 1 (from RUNNY) and not in position 2 (from CRANE). So R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- N is not in position 3 or 4 (both guesses). So N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Excluded letters are C, A, E, U, Y.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes R and N, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the excluded letters.  
The word **NORTH** fits:
- N is at position 1 (allowed).
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- Contains only new letters O, T, H, which haven’t been ruled out.
Thus “NORTH” is a valid next guess.

A common English word that satisfies these position constraints is **SNORT** (S N O R T), where N is in position 2 and R is in position 4. This guess also introduces new letters (S, O, T) to gather more information.
