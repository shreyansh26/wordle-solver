### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We should choose a new 5‑letter word that:
- Includes R in a different position.
- Uses letters we haven’t ruled out yet.
- Avoids C, A, N, E.

A common word fitting these constraints is **SPORT** (S‑P‑O‑R‑T). It places R in position 4, which respects the “not position 2” rule, and introduces new letters S, P, O, T for further testing.

- From Guess 1 (CRANE): C, A, N, E are not in the word. R is present but not in position 2.
- From Guess 2 (SPORT): S, P, O, T are not in the word. R is correct in position 4.

So the secret word has R at the 4th spot, and none of the letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T appear elsewhere.

We need a new 5‑letter word with R in the 4th position using only letters that haven't been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R).

A valid English word fitting this pattern is **BLURB** (B L U R B), which places R correctly at position 4 and uses only allowed letters.

Thus the next guess is BLURB.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information from previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, L.
- The letter R is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.
- The letter U is in the word but not at position 3 (it was marked “-” at position 3 in BLURB).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ R _. The letter U must appear in position 1, 2, or 5. All remaining unused letters (D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) are possible.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern, contains U (not at position 3), and has R at position 4. The word **QUIRK** satisfies all constraints:
- Q U I R K → R is in position 4.
- U is in position 2 (allowed).
- None of its letters have been eliminated already.

Therefore the next guess should be QUIRK.

We have gathered all feedback:
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, L, Q, I, K.
- R is confirmed in position 4 (R✓).
- U is confirmed in position 2 (U✓) and is not in position 3 (from earlier BLURB feedback).
Thus the secret pattern is _ U _ R _. The remaining possible letters (not eliminated) include D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word that fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and places U and R correctly is **HURRY** (H U R R Y). It respects U at position 2 and R at position 4, while introducing new letters H and Y for further testing.
