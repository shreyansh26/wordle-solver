### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess of a valid 5‑letter English word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters. “CRANE” is a good starter word because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E).

We have the following confirmed letters from the feedback:

- Position 4: **D** (green)
- Position 5: **E** (green)

Thus the pattern is **E _ U D E**.

The only common English word that fits the pattern **E?UDE** is **ELUDE** (E L U D E).

Even though the letter **L** was previously marked as “x”, the only viable word that matches the known greens is **ELUDE**, so we will try that as the next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters C,R,A,N,S,L,I,B,G are not in the word.
- U is in the word but not in position 2 (U got a “-” at position 2).

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ D E, must contain U (not at position 2), and must avoid the excluded letters.  
A common word fitting these constraints is **EXUDE** (E X U D E):  
- Position 4 = D, position 5 = E (matches known greens).  
- Contains U at position 3 (not position 2, satisfying the “-”).  
- Uses only allowed letters (E, X, U, D) none of which have been ruled out.

Therefore “EXUDE” is a logical next guess.
