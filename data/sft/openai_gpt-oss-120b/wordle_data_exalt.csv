### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common consonants and vowels, giving me useful information for future guesses. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter that covers two common consonants (C, R) and two vowels (A, E) plus another consonant (N). This should provide a good initial feedback.

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, N are not in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the 3rd position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the next guess must have A as the third letter, must include E somewhere other than the 5th spot, and must avoid C, R, N. A good candidate fitting these constraints is **LEAST** (L E A S T). It places A correctly, puts E in the 2nd position, and introduces new letters L, S, T to test.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ T (A is fixed at position 3, T at position 5).
- Letters known to be present: A, E, L, T.
- E is NOT in positions 2 or 5, so it can be in position 1 or 4.
- L is NOT in position 1, so it can be in position 2 or 4.
- Both E and L must appear somewhere, respecting the above.
- Letters excluded: C, R, N, S, and also L cannot be at 1, E cannot be at 2 or 5.

A word that satisfies all of these is **EXALT**:
- Position 1 = E (allowed, E not at 2 or 5)
- Position 2 = X (new letter, not prohibited)
- Position 3 = A (fixed)
- Position 4 = L (L not at 1, allowed here)
- Position 5 = T (fixed)

Thus “EXALT” meets all known constraints and introduces a new letter X to gather more information.
