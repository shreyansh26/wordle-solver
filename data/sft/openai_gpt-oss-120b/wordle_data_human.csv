### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which will give useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, N, and the vowels A and E.

We need a new guess that includes the known present letters A and N but not in the positions they were ruled out (A not at position 3, N not at position 4). We also must avoid letters known absent: C, R, and E. A common word fitting these constraints is **MANGO** (A at position 2, N at position 3, and uses only new letters M, G, O). This will test the positions of A and N and introduce new letters.

- M is present but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → can be in positions 2,3,5.
