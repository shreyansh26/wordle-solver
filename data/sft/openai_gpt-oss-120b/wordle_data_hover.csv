### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess for the secret 5‑letter word. Since I have no information yet, I’ll pick a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter: it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

From the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains R and E, excludes C, A, N, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

“RULER” fits:
- Letters: R, U, L, E, R
- Contains R and E.
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (not position 2).
- E is in position 4 (not position 5).
- No prohibited letters (C, A, N).

   - E is correct at position 4.  
   - R is correct at position 5.  
   - The first R gets a “‑” which, under standard duplicate handling, indicates a second R elsewhere (not position 1, not position 2, not position 5). Therefore the word contains a second R at position 3.

3. TIMER → T(x), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)

- Allowed letters for the first two positions are any letters not in the forbidden set.

A common English word matching “__RER” and respecting the constraints is **SORER** (S O R E R). It uses none of the excluded letters and places the second R at position 3, as required.

Since I have no information yet, I’ll pick a common word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter: it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains R and E, excludes C, A, N, and places R somewhere other than the second slot and E somewhere other than the fifth slot.

“RULER” fits:
- Letters: R, U, L, E, R
- Contains R and E.
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (not position 2).
- E is in position 4 (not position 5).
- No prohibited letters (C, A, N).

Thus, “RULER” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RULER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From CRANE: R present but not at position2, E present but not at position5, and C, A, N are absent.
- From RULER: Position4 E is correct, position5 R is correct. U and L are absent. The first R is present elsewhere (not position1). This aligns with the secret having a single R at position5, while the extra R in the guess is marked as present elsewhere due to the duplicate rule.

Thus far we know:
- Secret pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Letters not allowed: C, A, N, U, L
- R only at position5.
- E only at position4.

A common word fitting these constraints is **TIMER** (T I M E R), which respects all previous feedback.

Therefore the next logical guess is TIMER.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
   - Excludes C, A, N.  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. RULER → R(-), U(x), L(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
   - Excludes U, L.  
   - E is correct at position 4.  
   - R is correct at position 5.  
   - The first R gets a “‑” which, under standard duplicate handling, indicates a second R elsewhere (not position 1, not position 2, not position 5). Therefore the word contains a second R at position 3.

3. TIMER → T(x), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
   - Excludes T, I, M.  
   - Re‑confirms E at 4 and R at 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ R E R
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, U, L, T, I, M
- Allowed letters for the first two positions are any letters not in the forbidden set.

A common English word matching “__RER” and respecting the constraints is **SORER** (S O R E R). It uses none of the excluded letters and places the second R at position 3, as required.

Thus the next logical guess is SORER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 4: E (green from RULER, TIMER, SORER, POWER)
- Position 5: R (green from RULER, TIMER, SORER, POWER)

Letters known NOT to be in the word (x feedback): C, A, N, U, L, T, I, M, S, P, W.

So the secret pattern is: _ O _ E R, with the first and third letters unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding the letters listed above).

A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **JOKER** (J O K E R).

This introduces new letters J and K, which have not been ruled out, and respects all previous feedback.
