### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good opening guess is one that contains a mix of frequent letters (C, R, A, N, E) and includes both a vowel and several consonants. This should help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first guess:
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R and N are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (R ≠ position 2, N ≠ position 4).

We need a new word that:
- Contains R and N to test new positions.
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, E.

Choosing **RINGO** (R I N G O) places R at position 1 and N at position 3, and adds I, G, O as fresh letters while respecting the constraints.

We have the following information:

- From CRANE: C, A, E are NOT in the word. R and N are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- From RINGO: R is correct at position 1. I, N, O are in the word but in different positions than shown. G is NOT in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **R, I, N, O** plus one additional unknown letter that is not C, A, E, G.  
Positions known so far:
- Position 1 = R (confirmed)
- I cannot be at position 2
- N cannot be at position 3
- O cannot be at position 5

A common English word that fits all these constraints is **ROBIN**:
- R at position 1 (✓)
- O at position 2 (O is present and not at 5)
- B at position 3 (new letter, not excluded)
- I at position 4 (I is present and not at 2)
- N at position 5 (N is present and not at 3)

All constraints are satisfied, so “ROBIN” is a good next guess.
