### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- O is correct in position 2.
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions 3 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters A, N, E, T, H are not in the word.

To satisfy these constraints, choose a word that:
- Has O at the second slot.
- Places C at position 3 (allowed) and R at position 1 (allowed).
- Uses two other letters that haven’t been ruled out.

The word **ROCKS** meets all conditions:
- R (pos 1), O (pos 2, correct), C (pos 3), K (pos 4), S (pos 5).
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus ROCKS is a valid next guess.
