### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, E placed in different spots and introduces new letters while avoiding C and N.

We have the following constraints from all feedback:

- The word pattern is **_ A _ E R**.
- R is confirmed at position 5 (it cannot be in positions 1‑4).
- A is confirmed at position 2.
- E is confirmed at position 4.
- M is present in the word but not at position 1 (M‑ from guess 4). Since positions 2 and 4 are already taken by A and E, M must be at position 3.

Thus the word must be **_ A M E R**.

Letters ruled out: C, N, V, L, B, D, K (all received “x”).  
Possible first letters that are not excluded include G, T, J, F, etc. The common English word that fits the pattern is **GAMER**.

I'll guess that.
