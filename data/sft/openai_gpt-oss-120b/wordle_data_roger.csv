### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"": R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5. Also, C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

We should choose a new word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and introduces new letters to gather more information. ""PERIL"" satisfies these conditions:
- Contains E (position 2) and R (position 3), both in new positions.
- Does not use C, A, or N.
- Introduces new letters P, I, L for further clues.
Thus, ""PERIL"" is a good next guess.
