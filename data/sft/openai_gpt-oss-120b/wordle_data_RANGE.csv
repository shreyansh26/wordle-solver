### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placement to get useful feedback. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). This will help identify which letters are present and their positions early on.

The feedback tells me:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 is correct).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters **S, L, T** are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4. I should choose a new guess that respects these constraints, uses E at the end, places A in a different spot to test its actual position, and introduces fresh letters to gather more information.  

A good candidate is **MAYBE**:
- Ends with E.
- Places A in position 2 (different from the previous guess).
- Introduces new letters M, Y, and B to test their presence.

This will give clear feedback on A’s exact location and on the new letters.
