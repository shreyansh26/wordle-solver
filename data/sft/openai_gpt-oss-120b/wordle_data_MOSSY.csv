### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a solid opening guess that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. A good starter word is “SLATE” because it contains:
- Two common consonants (S, L, T) that appear frequently in English words.
- Two vowels (A, E) to test which vowel(s) are present in the secret word.
- It covers a variety of positions for these letters.

Thus, I will guess “SLATE”.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letter S, but it is not in the first position. The letters L, A, T, and E are not in the word at all. 

Therefore, the next guess should:
- Include S somewhere other than the first position.
- Exclude L, A, T, E completely.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **CRISP**:
- Contains S in the 4th position (not first).
- Uses new letters C, R, I, and P, none of which have been ruled out.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus, we will guess ""CRISP"".
