### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word ends with **E** and does **not** contain the letters C, R, A, N anywhere. I need a new five‑letter word that respects these constraints and introduces fresh letters to test. 

Choosing a word with common consonants and vowels while keeping E in the fifth position, “SLOPE” works well:
- S, L, O, P are all unused so far.
- The final E satisfies the known correct placement.
Thus “SLOPE” is a good next guess.

- Letter I is in the word but not in position 3 (from SWIVE, where I was 3rd and got “-”).

Thus I must be in position 2 or 4.  
A good way to decide is to place I at position 2 and keep the rest of the word fresh, while still respecting the known correct letters S (1) and E (5).  

The word **SIEVE** fits these criteria:
- S at position 1 (✓ already known).
- I at position 2 (tests whether I belongs here).
- Introduces new letters E (already known) and V (known to be absent, which will simply return “x” and confirm our knowledge), and repeats the final E (✓).

We have determined from feedback:
- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: I is correct.
- Position 3: E is correct.
- Position 5: E is correct.
- Position 4 cannot be V (and also not any previously eliminated letters C,R,A,N,L,O,P,W).
Thus the word fits the pattern S I E _ E. The common English word that fits is ""SIEGE"" (with G in the fourth position). This uses only letters not ruled out, so it should be the secret word.
