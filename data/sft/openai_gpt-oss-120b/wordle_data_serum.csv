### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I'll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes the vowel 'A' and frequently appearing consonants.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tries new letters to gather more information. ""RULER"" satisfies these conditions:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5, both allowed) and E (position 4, allowed).
- No prohibited letters C, A, N.
- Introduces new letters U, L, and T for further clues.

Thus we will guess ""RULER"".

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, L.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 → must be position 3.
- U is in the word but not position 2 → can be 1, 4, 5.
- E is in the word but not positions 4 or 5 → can be 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is R) → so E is at 1 or 2.
Thus the pattern is **_ _ R _ _** with E at position 1 or 2 and U at position 1, 4, or 5.

A valid English word that fits all these constraints is **SERUM**:
- Pattern: S E R U M → R is at position 3.
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- U is at position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- No forbidden letters are present.

Therefore we guess SERUM.
