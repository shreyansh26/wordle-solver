### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to make an initial guess for the secret 5‑letter word. Since I have no feedback yet, I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of frequent letters and covers a variety of positions. “SLATE” uses common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E), giving a good chance to learn about the secret word’s letters and positions.

From the first guess SLATE we learned:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both S and A, with S not in the first slot and A not in the third slot, and avoids L, T, E.  
A good candidate is **ARSON**:
- Contains A (position 1) – not position 3.
- Contains S (position 3) – not position 1.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (R, O, N are all still possible).

Thus the next guess will be ARSON.
