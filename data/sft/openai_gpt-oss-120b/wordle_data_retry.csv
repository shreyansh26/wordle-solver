# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined:

- Letters eliminated: A, B, C, D, I, N, O, S, T, U, V, X, and also B, U, S from guess 4, plus D, O, X from guess 3, plus C, A, N, I, V, T, etc.

Remaining possible letters for positions 3‑5 are from {F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, Y, Z, R (could repeat)}.

Word must be a valid English word starting with “RE”. Candidates like “refly” (R‑E‑F‑L‑Y) fit the constraints: no eliminated letters, and E does not appear in positions 4 or 5 (which is required). Thus “REFLY” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, avoids C, A, N, and places R and E in different positions than those ruled out. Choosing “RIVET” puts R at position 1 and E at position 4, satisfying all constraints.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have these constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, I, V, T.
- Letter E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses) and also not in position 5 from guess1.
- Remaining three letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the banned letters.
A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is **REDOX**:
- R in position 1 (✓).
- E in position 2 (allowed for E).
- D, O, X are not among the excluded letters.
- No forbidden letters appear, and E is not placed at positions 4 or 5.
Thus we will guess REDOX.

Letters excluded from the word: A, B, C, D, F, I, L, N, O, S, T, U, V, X.

A common English word fitting this pattern and respecting all exclusions is **REEKY** (meaning “having a strong odor”). It uses only allowed letters (the second E is a repeat, which is permissible) and places K in a previously unused position.
