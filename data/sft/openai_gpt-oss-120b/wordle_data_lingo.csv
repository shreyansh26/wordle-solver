### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. The letter N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it was marked “-” in CRANE, where N was fourth). Therefore our next guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, E.
- Include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).

Choosing a word that places N at the first position gives us clear information about its correct spot and lets us test new letters. “NIGHT” satisfies all constraints: it contains N (at position 1), and the other letters I, G, H, T are all unused yet, providing fresh data.

Thus the next guess will be “NIGHT”.
