### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and their positions. Words like “CRANE”, “SLATE”, or “RAISE” are popular starter choices. I’ll pick **CRANE** because it includes the vowel “A” and the common consonants C, R, N, and E, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

We know the secret word has R in the second position and A in the third position. Letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all. So the pattern is _ R A _ _. I need a new word that fits this pattern and introduces new letters to narrow it down. “BRAVO” matches: B‑R‑A‑V‑O, respects the known positions and avoids C, N, E. It also tests B, V, and O.

We have confirmed letters:
- R is correct in position 2 (✓)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)

Eliminated letters (not in the word at all): C, N, E, B, V, O.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R A _ _. We need to choose a word that fits this pattern while introducing new, untested letters to narrow possibilities. 

Candidate letters not yet ruled out include: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

A good word that fits the pattern and uses three new letters is **GRASP**:
- G (new)
- R (fixed position 2)
- A (fixed position 3)
- S (new)
- P (new)

This will test three new consonants and keep the known correct placements.
