### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word must contain **R** and **N**, and they cannot be in these positions:

Allowed positions:

We need a common 5‑letter English word that includes R and N, avoids the excluded letters {C, A, E, U, T, S}, and respects the position constraints.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R and N are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (R is not position 2, N is not position 4).

I need a new five‑letter word that includes R and N, excludes C, A, E, and places R and N in different positions from those indicated. “RUNTS” fits:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3), avoiding the forbidden spots.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (U, T, S).
Thus “RUNTS” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RUNTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) N(-) T(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, E are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From RUNTS: U, T, S are not in the word. R is still not in position 1 (the dash means present elsewhere). N is still not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain **R** and **N**, and they cannot be in these positions:
- R cannot be 1, 2.
- N cannot be 3, 4.

Allowed positions:
- R can be 3, 4, or 5.
- N can be 1, 2, or 5 (but not the same slot as R).

We need a common 5‑letter English word that includes R and N, avoids the excluded letters {C, A, E, U, T, S}, and respects the position constraints.

The word **MORON** fits:
- Contains R (position 3) – allowed.
- Contains N (position 5) – allowed.
- Uses only letters M, O, R, O, N, none of which are excluded.

Therefore the next logical guess is MORON.
