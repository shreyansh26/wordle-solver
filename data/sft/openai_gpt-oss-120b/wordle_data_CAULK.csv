### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- Letter L is in the word but not at position 3, so it must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters R, N, E, V, I, M, S are not in the word (all marked x).

We need a word of the form C A _ _ _. Since L cannot be in position 3, the only possible slots for L are positions 4 or 5.

A viable word that fits these constraints is **C A B A L**:
- C in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- B is a new letter to test
- A appears again (allowed)
- L in position 5 (allowed, L is not in position 3)

This guess will confirm whether B is correct and also verify that L belongs at position 5.

We have established:
- Position 1 = C (always ✓).
- Position 2 = A (✓ from guess 2).
- Letter L is in the word but not at positions 3, 5 (both gave “-”), so it must be at position 4.
- Eliminated letters: R, N, E, V, I, M, S, B (all marked x).  
- Remaining unknown letters are at positions 3 and 5, and must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z).

A common English word fitting the pattern **C A _ L _** with unused letters is **CAULK** (C‑A‑U‑L‑K), placing L correctly at position 4 and introducing two new letters, U and K, to test.

Thus the next guess should be “CAULK”.
