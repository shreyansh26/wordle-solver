I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that covers a mix of common letters and different positions. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E) and spreads them across the word. I'll use that as my first guess.

We know the secret word has C, R, A, and E in the correct first, second, third, and fifth positions, respectively. The fourth letter is still unknown, and we know N is not in the word at all. So the pattern is:

C R A _ E

We need a valid 5‑letter English word fitting this pattern. Possible candidates include “CRATE”, “CRAPE”, “CRAVE”, etc. I’ll choose “CRATE” to test the fourth letter as T.
