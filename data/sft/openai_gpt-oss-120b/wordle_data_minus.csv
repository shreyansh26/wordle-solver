### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

We need a new word that:
1. Excludes C, R, A, E.
2. Contains N, placed in a different slot (1, 2, 3, or 5).

Choosing “BUNTS” satisfies these conditions:
- Letters B, U, N, T, S are all new (none are C, R, A, E).
- N is in the 3rd position, giving us information about its correct spot.

Thus the next guess is “BUNTS”.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From BUNTS: B and T are not in the word; N is correct in position 3; S is correct in position 5; U is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
1: ?, 2: ?, 3: N, 4: ?, 5: S
U must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2, 3, or 5).  

Looking for a common English word fitting _ _ N _ S with U at position 4, the word **MINUS** (M I N U S) satisfies all constraints: N is third, S fifth, U fourth, and none of the excluded letters (C,R,A,E,B,T) appear.

Therefore the next guess should be MINUS.
