### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- L is correct in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like _ L _ _ _.  
We need A in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.

- No forbidden letters (S, T, E) are present.

- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like _ L _ _ _.  
We need A in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.  
Choose a word that keeps L in the second slot, places A elsewhere, and introduces new letters while avoiding S, T, and E.

""ALBUM"" fits:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is in the correct position 2.
- B, U, M are new letters to test.
- No forbidden letters (S, T, E) are present.

Thus the next guess will be **ALBUM**.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 1: A (from guess 2, A is correct).
- Position 2: L (from guess 1, L is correct).
- Positions 3‑5 are unknown.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U, M (from previous feedback).

So the secret word looks like **A L _ _ _** and must avoid the excluded letters.

A good next guess should keep the known correct letters (A and L in the first two spots) and introduce new letters to test possibilities for the remaining three positions.  
The word **ALIGN** fits this pattern:

- Keeps A and L in the first two positions.
- Introduces three new letters (I, G, N) that have not been ruled out yet.
- Contains no forbidden letters (S, T, E, B, U, M).

Thus “ALIGN” is an optimal next guess.

We have confirmed:

- Position 2: L (✓ from SLATE and ALBUM)
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, B, U, M, I, G, N, O, Y (all marked x)
- The L in position 3 of ALLOY received a “-”, meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. Since we already know L is correctly placed at position 2, there is no requirement for a second L.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **A L _ _ _** and must avoid the excluded letters.  
We need a word starting with “AL” using only letters that haven’t been ruled out (C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Z, etc.).  
A common valid choice is **ALPHA** (A‑L‑P‑H‑A), which introduces new letters P and H while repeating A, all of which are still possible.
