### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This will give me information about both vowel and consonant placement for the secret word.

We know from the first guess:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains C, A, and E to test their positions.
2. Does not use R or N.
3. Places C, A, and E in positions different from those ruled out.

The word **CADET** fits:
- C is in position 1 (still wrong, but we’ll learn it’s not 1).
- A is in position 2 (different from the forbidden position 3).
- E is in position 4 (different from the forbidden position 5).
- It introduces new letters D and T for additional clues.
- No R or N appear.

Thus CADET is a good next guess.

From the feedback:

- Position 5 is T (T ✓).
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (C -), so C must be in position 3.
