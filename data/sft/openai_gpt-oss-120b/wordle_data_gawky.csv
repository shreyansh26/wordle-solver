### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- Letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word.
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (the position it occupied in “SLATE”).

Thus the secret word must contain A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and must avoid S, L, T, E.

- Includes A in a different position (not third).
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

- Eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, R, C, H, B, O, U, and also any repeats of those.
So allowed letters are: D, F, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and maybe others like A already used).

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the second slot, Y somewhere other than the third slot, and only using allowed letters.

A good candidate is **FANNY**:
- Positions: F A N N Y
- A is in position 2 (matches).
- Y is in position 5 (not position 3, satisfies the “‑” feedback).
- No eliminated letters appear.

Thus we will guess ""FANNY"".

We have confirmed:
- A is correct in position 2.
- Y is correct in position 5.
- Letters eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, R, C, H, B, O, U, F, N, and any repeats of them.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ A _ _ Y, using only letters not eliminated. Viable common words include “GAWKY” (G A W K Y) and “JAZZY”. Both satisfy the pattern and use only allowed letters. I’ll choose “GAWKY”.
