### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- D is correct in position 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so R can be in position 1 or 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 2, so O can be in position 1, 3, 4 (but not 5 because D is there).
- Letters C, A, N, E, W, L are not in the word.

A good candidate that respects the known positions is **SWORD**:
- D stays at position 5.
- It places O at position 3 (allowed) and R at position 4 (allowed).
- It introduces a new letter S while re‑using the known‑absent letter W (which will be confirmed as absent again).

Thus we guess “SWORD”.
