### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and spreads them across the word to get useful information. “CRANE” contains three frequently used consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E), which should give a solid baseline for the first round.

We know from the feedback that the secret word has R as the second letter and N as the fourth letter. The letters C, A, and E are not in the word at any position. We need a new 5‑letter word that fits the pattern _ R _ N _. Choosing a word without C, A, or E, such as **BRING** (B‑R‑I‑N‑G), satisfies all constraints and gives new letters to test.

We have confirmed letters:
- R is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- N is correct in position 4.
Eliminated letters (not in the word at any position): C, A, E, B, G.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R I N _. We need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. Viable common words fitting the pattern include **PRINT** (P R I N T) and **DRINK** (D R I N K). Both introduce two new letters to test. I’ll choose “PRINT” to test P and T.
