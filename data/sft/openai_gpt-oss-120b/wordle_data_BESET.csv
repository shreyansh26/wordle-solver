### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle-style game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it tests three frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Thus the secret word must contain an E in positions 1‑4, and cannot contain C, R, A, N. Choose a common word fitting these constraints. “BLESS” has E in position 3, and uses only letters B, L, S which are not excluded. It’s a valid 5‑letter word and will give new information.

We have these constraints:
- Position 1 = B (from B✓).
- Letters C,R,A,N,L are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in positions 3 (from BLESS) nor 5 (from CRANE). So E can be in position 2 or 4.
- S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (both S’s were marked “-”). Thus S can be in position 2 or 3.
- Only one S is needed (both S’s cannot both be present because there’s only one slot left for E).

Two viable layouts:
1. B E S _ _ (E at 2, S at 3)
2. B S _ E _ (S at 2, E at 4)

The first layout yields real words like **BESET** (B‑E‑S‑E‑T). This fits all constraints:
- B at 1, E at 2, S at 3, another E at 4 (allowed), T at 5 (a new, allowed letter).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus “BESET” is a strong next guess.
