### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and different positions to gather information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good starter because it uses frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

From the first feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the next guess must include R and A, avoid C, N, E, and place R and A in different positions than the ones ruled out. A good candidate is **RAIDS**:
- R is placed at position 1 (allowed).
- A is placed at position 2 (allowed).
- It introduces new letters I, D, S to test further.

We have:

- Position 1: R (correct from guess 2)
- Position 2: A (correct from guess 2)
- Letters not in word: C, N, E, I, S
- D is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 2)
- R is not in position 2 (already satisfied) and A not in position 3 (already satisfied)

Thus the pattern is: **R A _ _ _**, with D somewhere except position 4.

A common word that fits these constraints is **RADAR** (R A D A R):
- D is at position 3 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters are used
- Re‑using R and A in other positions is permissible since we have no evidence they cannot appear again.

So the next guess will be RADAR.
