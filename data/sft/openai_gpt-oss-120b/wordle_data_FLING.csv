### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has N in the fourth position, and it does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E anywhere. For the next guess we need a word that:
- Has N as the fourth letter.
- Uses only new letters (avoiding C, R, A, E) to test more possibilities.
A good candidate is **MOUND** (M‑O‑U‑N‑D). It satisfies the constraints and introduces four new letters (M, O, U, D) while keeping N in the correct spot.

We have determined the known letters and positions:

- Position 4: N (✓)

From guess GLINT, G was marked (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 1. Positions 2‑4 are already occupied, so G must be in position 5. Therefore the pattern is _ L I N G.

All letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, E, M, O, U, D, B, K, T, and also G is already placed at the end. The only remaining unknown letter is the first position, which must be a consonant not in the excluded list.

Valid English words fitting the pattern are **SLING** and **FLING** (both use an allowed first letter). Either could be the secret word. I’ll choose one to continue narrowing possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
