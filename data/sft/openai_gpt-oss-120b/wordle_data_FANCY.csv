### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have feedback from the first guess CRANE:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains the letters C, A, and N, each in a different position than shown above. It does **not** contain R or E.

We need a new five‑letter word that:
1. Includes C, A, and N.
2. Places them in positions that are allowed (C ≠ 1, A ≠ 3, N ≠ 4).
3. Uses two other letters to gather more information, avoiding R and E.

The word **MANIC** satisfies all constraints:
- M A N I C
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- C is in position 5 (allowed).
- It introduces new letters M and I for further testing, and it contains no R or E.

Thus the next guess will be MANIC.

We have the following confirmed information:
- A is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- C is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5; from previous guesses it cannot be at 1,2,3,5, so C must be at position 4.
- Letters ruled out: R, E, M, I, and any other letters from previous feedback are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ A N C _.

A common English word matching this pattern is **FANCY** (F A N C Y). It uses only allowed letters and places C at position 4 as required.

So the next guess is “FANCY”.
