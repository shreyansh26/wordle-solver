### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 1: S is correct (✓).
- Position 3: O is correct (✓).
- Position 5: E is correct (✓).
- Positions 2 and 4 are still unknown.

Letters ruled out so far: C, R, A, N, H, U, M, K, and also the letters O cannot be in position 2, S cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied).

We need a valid English word of the form S _ O _ E using only letters not excluded. “STOVE” fits perfectly:
- S (position 1) matches.
- T is a new candidate for position 2.
- O (position 3) matches.
- V is a new candidate for position 4.
- E (position 5) matches.

Thus the next guess should be “STOVE”.

The current confirmed pattern from feedback is:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: T (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: unknown, but V is not correct (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Letters that are known NOT to be in the word: C, R, A, N, H, U, M, K, V, plus any letters that received an “x” in earlier guesses.

We need a valid English word of the form **S T O _ E** where the fourth letter is not V and has not been ruled out. The word **STOLE** fits:
- It matches the confirmed letters S T O _ E.
- The fourth letter L has not been eliminated.
- All letters are allowed.
