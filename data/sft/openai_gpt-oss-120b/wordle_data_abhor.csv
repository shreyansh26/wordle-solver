### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give a good spread of feedback.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, N, and E are not in the word.
- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”; i.e., R is not the 2nd letter, A is not the 3rd letter.
We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes R and A in different positions, avoids C, N, and E, and introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **PAIRS**:
- Contains both A and R (A in position 2, R in position 4, satisfying the position constraints).
- Introduces the new letters P, I, and S.
- No forbidden letters (C, N, E) appear.

We have two feedbacks:
- From CRANE: C, N, E are not in the word. R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- From PAIRS: P, I, S are not in the word. A is still in the word but not in position 2. R is still in the word but not in position 4.

Thus eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, I, S.
Required letters: A and R, placed in positions other than those they occupied in previous guesses.

Possible positions:
- R cannot be 2 or 4 → R can be 1, 3, or 5.
- A cannot be 2 or 3 → A can be 1, 4, or 5.

A word that fits these constraints and uses only new letters (avoiding the eliminated set) is **MORAL**:
- Positions: M(1) O(2) R(3) A(4) L(5)
- R is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 4 (allowed).
- New letters M, O, L are not yet ruled out.
