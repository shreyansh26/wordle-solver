### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 2 is R (✓ from guess 3).
- Position 3 is E (✓ from guess 3).
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5, leaving position 4 as the only possible spot.

Thus the word pattern is: _ R E A _.

Letters eliminated: S, L, T, G, N.  
Remaining letters are still possible.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **CREAM** (C R E A M), which introduces two new letters C and M while respecting all known constraints.

So the next guess should be “CREAM”.

We have determined the pattern:
- Position 2 = R (confirmed)
- Position 3 = E (confirmed)
- Position 4 = A (must be, since A cannot be in any other position)

Thus the word looks like _ R E A _. Letters known to be absent: S, L, T, G, N, C, M.  
Remaining unknown letters are at positions 1 and 5. Viable common English words fitting the pattern are **BREAD** and **DREAD** (and others like FREAK).  
Both B and D have not been ruled out, but **BREAD** is the most common word, so we guess that next.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

  - A is not in positions 2 or 3.

1. Contains A, E, and R (to test their correct spots).
2. Places them in positions that have not been ruled out.
3. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (avoid S, L, T, G).

The word **ARENA** satisfies these conditions:

- R is at position 2 (allowed).
- E is at position 3 (allowed).
