### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is correct at position 3.
- S is correct at position 4.
- There is another S somewhere else (because the second S in GLASS got a “-”). It cannot be at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 2.
Excluded letters (from X feedback): C, R, N, E, G, L.

We need a 5‑letter word matching pattern _ _ A S _, containing a second S at position 1 or 2, and no forbidden letters. “STASH” (S‑T‑A‑S‑H) fits perfectly: A is third, S is fourth, another S is first, and T, H are not excluded.
