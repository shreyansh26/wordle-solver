# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a frequently used starter in these games because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the two most common vowels (A, E). This should give us a solid base for the first round of feedback.

We know C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. The letter E is in the word but not in the last position (position 5). Our next guess should avoid the excluded letters and place E in a different slot while testing new letters. “SLIDE” meets these criteria: it contains E in position 5 (which is still last, but we need E not in position 5). Oops, need E not at position 5. Actually, we must place E elsewhere. Choose a word with E not at position 5, e.g., “PEELS” (E in positions 2 and 3) but contains duplicate E. Better: “LEMON” has N which is excluded. Let's pick “DEPOT”: D 1, E 2, P 3, O 4, T 5 – E is in position 2, which is allowed, and no excluded letters appear.

Our next guess should avoid the excluded letters and place E in a different slot while testing new letters. “SLIDE” meets these criteria: it contains E in position 5 (which is still last, but we need E not in position 5). Oops, need E not at position 5. Actually, we must place E elsewhere. Choose a word with E not at position 5, e.g., “PEELS” (E in positions 2 and 3) but contains duplicate E. Better: “LEMON” has N which is excluded. Let's pick “DEPOT”: D 1, E 2, P 3, O 4, T 5 – E is in position 2, which is allowed, and no excluded letters appear.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

Based on the feedback:

- The second **E** is somewhere else (the “-” on the E in position 4 of DEWED).

- The only positions left are 3, 4, 5, and the letters already ruled out (C,R,A,N,P,O,T,I,F,Y,M,W) cannot be used.

A strong candidate that fits the known pattern **D E ? ? ?** and tests the possibility of a second D and a second E is **DEEDS**. This word keeps the known letters in place and introduces D and S in the remaining spots, allowing us to confirm whether the extra D and the presence of S are correct.
