### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first letter C is correct. All other letters from the first two guesses (R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D) are not in the word anywhere.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a common word starting with C that uses four of these unused letters. “CHIPS” fits: it uses H, I, P, S, all of which have not been tested yet and are allowed.

Common words fitting “CHI__” include CHICK (adds K) and CHIVY (adds V and Y). To test new letters efficiently, a guess that introduces two fresh letters is optimal. CHIVY uses V and Y, both untested, and is a valid English word. This will confirm whether either of those letters belongs in the secret word.

Thus the next guess is CHIVY.

We have confirmed the first three letters: C (position 1), H (2), I (3). All other letters tried (R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, P, S, V, Y) are not in the word. Remaining possible letters for positions 4‑5 are B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, T, W, X, Z. A common English word that fits the pattern “CHI??” and uses only unused letters is **CHICK** (adding C again in position 4 and K in position 5). This will test whether a repeated C and the letter K are correct.
