### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The next guess should therefore contain both L and A, place them in different positions from those ruled out, and avoid S, T, and E. “BALMY” satisfies these conditions (A at position 2, L at position 3, and none of the excluded letters appear).

We have confirmed:
- I is correct at position 3 (from AXIAL).
- L is present but not in positions 1,2,3,5, so L must be at position 4.

All letters that have received an “x” are ruled out: S, T, E, B, M, Y, U, N, R, X.

We need a plausible English word fitting the pattern, using only letters not yet excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- S, T, and E are not in the secret word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

The next guess should therefore contain both L and A, place them in different positions from those ruled out, and avoid S, T, and E. “BALMY” satisfies these conditions (A at position 2, L at position 3, and none of the excluded letters appear).

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:

- Letters L and A are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in previous guesses.
  * L is not in position 2 (SLATE) nor position 3 (BALMY), so L can be 1, 4, or 5.
  * A is not in position 3 (SLATE) nor position 2 (BALMY), so A can be 1, 4, or 5.
We need a word containing both L and A in allowed slots, plus three other letters not ruled out. A good candidate is **LUNAR** (L in position 1, A in position 4) which introduces new letters U, N, R for testing.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, B, M, Y, U, N, R.
- Letters present but misplaced: L and A.

Positions ruled out:
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → L can be only 4 or 5.
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → A can be only 1 or 5.

A viable pattern is A _ _ _ L (A in position 1, L in position 5).  
A common word that fits this pattern and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out is **AXIAL** (A‑X‑I‑A‑L). It places A correctly at position 1 and L correctly at position 5, while introducing new letters X and I for further testing.

Thus the next guess is:
