### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 is A (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).

Eliminated letters (not in the word at all): R, I, S, T, L.

From guess 2 (TABLE) we got B(-), meaning B is in the word but not in position 3. So B must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is E, so B can be at position 1 or 4.

Thus the pattern is:
1: B or other non‑eliminated letter (but B must appear somewhere)
2: A
3: not B
4: B or other non‑eliminated letter
5: E

A common English word fitting this pattern, containing B (not in position 3) and using none of the eliminated letters, is **BADGE** (B A D G E). It places B at position 1, satisfies A and E, and introduces new letters D and G which have not been ruled out.

So the next guess should be BADGE.
