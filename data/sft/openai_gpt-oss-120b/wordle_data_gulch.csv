### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these types of games because it tests two frequent vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give a good spread of feedback for the next steps.

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain a C somewhere other than the first letter, and the other four letters cannot be R, A, N, or E. I’ll choose a word that places C in a different position and uses common letters that aren’t excluded. “TOUCH” has C in the fourth position and contains none of the excluded letters.
