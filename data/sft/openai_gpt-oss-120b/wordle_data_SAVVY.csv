### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed as S, A, and Y respectively.
- Letters L, T, E, N, D, U, C are not in the word.
The remaining pattern is **S A _ _ Y**.
Possible common words fitting this pattern include SASSY, SAPPY, SAGGY, and SAVVY. 
Choosing **SASSY** lets us test whether the middle letters are also S’s without introducing new letters, which will give the most decisive information.

We have the pattern S A _ _ Y. Feedback so far:
- Positions 1 (S), 2 (A), and 5 (Y) are correct.
- Letters L, T, E, N, D, U, C are not in the word.
- The letter S appears in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (the dash for both S’s in guess SASSY). Since we already have S at position 1, that satisfies the condition; there is only one S in the secret word, located at position 1.

Thus the remaining unknown letters (positions 3 and 4) must be chosen from letters not yet ruled out: G, P, V, etc. Common words fitting S A _ _ Y include:
- SAGGY (uses G)
- SAVVY (uses V)
- SAPPY (uses P)

Choosing a word with two new letters gives the most information. I’ll try “SAGGY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- L, T, and E are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ _ _.  
A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
We need a common 5‑letter word starting with S, containing A (not in the 3rd slot), and avoiding L, T, and E.

""SANDY"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 2 (acceptable).
- Contains no L, T, or E.
- Is a valid English word.

Thus we guess ""SANDY"".

Thus the pattern is **S A _ _ Y** with the two middle letters coming from the remaining alphabet (excluding the ruled‑out letters). Common words that fit this pattern include:
