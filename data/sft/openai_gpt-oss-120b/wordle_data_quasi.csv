- Letter S is in the word but not in position 1, so S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We have determined from the feedback:
- Position 3 is A (correct).
- Position 4 is S (correct).
- Letters L, T, E, C, R, H are not in the word.
- S is not at position 1 (already known from first feedback).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form __AS_ using only allowed letters.  
A suitable common word that fits is **QUASI** (Q U A S I):  
- A is in position 3, S in position 4.  
- None of the excluded letters appear.  

Thus the next guess is QUASI.
