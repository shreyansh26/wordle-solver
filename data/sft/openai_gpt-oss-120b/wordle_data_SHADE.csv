2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with an initial guess. I’ll choose a common 5-letter word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes common consonants and vowels.

We know the secret word has S in position 1, A in position 3, and E in position 5. Positions 2 and 4 are unknown, but cannot be L or T (they were marked absent). We need a common 5‑letter word of the form S _ A _ E. Candidates include “SPADE”, “SHADE”, “SNAKE”, etc. All fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters. I’ll try “SPADE”.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: unknown, but letters L and P are ruled out.
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: D (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the word is S _ A D E. The common English word fitting this pattern is ""SHADE"". The letter H hasn't been ruled out, so it's a logical next guess.
