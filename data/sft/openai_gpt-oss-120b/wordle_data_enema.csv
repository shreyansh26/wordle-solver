### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C and R are not in the word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE.
  - A is not in position 3.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

For the second guess we should include A and N (to confirm their presence) and can also start testing new letters. We must avoid placing A at the third slot, N at the fourth slot, and E at the fifth slot. A convenient word that respects these constraints and introduces fresh letters is **ANVIL** (A‑1, N‑2, V‑3, I‑4, L‑5). This respects all positional restrictions and gives us new letters to evaluate.

- E is in the word but not in position 5 → possible positions 1, 3, 4 (but not 2 because N is there).

A word that respects all these constraints and introduces new letters for testing is **SNEAK**:
- N is in the required position 2.
