### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know the secret word has A in the third position. It contains R, but R cannot be in the second position. The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new guess that respects these constraints and tests new letters. ""SHARP"" fits: it has A third, places R at position 4 (allowed), and introduces S, H, and P for new information while avoiding C, N, and E.

We have the following feedback:

1. Guess CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
   - C, N, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is correct in position 3.

2. Guess SHARP → S(x) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) P(-)
   - S and H are not in the word.
   - A is correct in position 3 (confirms previous).
   - R is correct in position 4 (so R’s wrong‑position hint from guess 1 is resolved).
   - P is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret pattern is: _ _ A R _.  
P must be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 5).  
Possible arrangement that fits all clues is **APART** (A P A R T).

Checking “APART” against the feedback:
- CRANE: C‑x, R‑present‑wrong‑place, A‑✓, N‑x, E‑x ✔
- SHARP: S‑x, H‑x, A‑✓, R‑✓, P‑present‑wrong‑place ✔

All conditions are satisfied, so “APART” is a logical next guess.
