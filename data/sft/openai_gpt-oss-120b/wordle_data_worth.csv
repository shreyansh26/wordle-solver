### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I want to start with a common, information‑rich word that uses frequent letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it includes the common letters C, R, N, and the two most common vowels A and E. This should give a good spread of feedback for the secret word.

We know from the first guess that C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter R is in the word but not in position 2. For the next guess I should include R in a different spot and try several new letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “SHRUB” places R at position 3 and introduces S, H, U, and B, all of which are still possible. This will give us more information about the remaining letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- R is correct in position 3 (from SHRUB).
- H is in the word but not in position 2 (from SHRUB where H got a “-”). So H can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, U, B (all got “x”).

We need three more letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is the word **FORTH**:
- Positions: F (1), O (2), R (3), T (4), H (5).
- R is correctly placed at position 3.
- H is at position 5, which satisfies “not position 2”.
- The other letters (F, O, T) have not been tried yet and are not among the excluded letters.
