### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- R is correct in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in positions 1‑4.
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that keeps R in the second slot, places E somewhere other than the fifth slot, and avoids C, A, N. Choosing “BRIEF” gives:
- R stays in position 2.
- E moves to position 4 (valid).
- No C, A, or N are present.
- Introduces new letters B, I, F for further information.

Thus “BRIEF” is a solid next guess.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letter F is in the word but not in position 5 (F – in the second guess). Therefore F must be in position 1 or 3.

So the pattern is _ R _ E _. We must place F in position 1 or 3, avoid the excluded letters, and use common letters for the remaining spots.

A valid English word that fits these constraints is **FROES**:
- F at position 1,
- R at position 2 (matches known ✓),

- E at position 4 (matches known ✓),
- S at position 5 (new letter, not excluded, and F is not at position 5).

This guess will confirm the location of F and test the new letters O and S.
