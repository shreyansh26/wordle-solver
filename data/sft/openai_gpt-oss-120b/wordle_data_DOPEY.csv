### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (the last slot).

Choosing a word with E in position 2 works well and introduces new letters to test. “HEIST” fits: H‑E‑I‑S‑T, with E in the second position and no C, R, A, or N.

Thus E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

A valid word using only allowed letters and placing E in acceptable positions is **BLEED** (B‑L‑E‑E‑D), where E appears in positions 3 and 4, both permissible. It also tests new letters B, L, and D.

We have deduced:

- E is in the word and fixed at position 4 (feedback gave E✓ at position 4, and E was not in positions 2,3,5).
- D is in the word but not at position 5 (feedback gave D‑ at position 3, meaning D is present elsewhere).

Thus the secret word must have pattern:
_ _ _ E _
with D somewhere in positions 1‑3 and no eliminated letters.

A valid English word fitting these constraints is **MODEM**:
M O D E M  
- D is at position 3 (allowed).  
- E is at position 4 (correct).  
- Uses only allowed letters (M, O, D, E) none of which have been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “MODEM”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

with D somewhere in positions 1‑3 and no eliminated letters.

A valid English word fitting these constraints is **MODEM**:
M O D E M  
- D is at position 3 (allowed).  
- E is at position 4 (correct).  
- Uses only allowed letters (M, O, D, E) none of which have been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “MODEM”.

We have determined from feedback:
- Position 1: D (present, not elsewhere)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- D is not at positions 3,5,2,4 → must be position1.
- The remaining unknown letters are at positions 3 and 5.
- Letters eliminated so far: C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T,B,L,M.
- We need a common 5‑letter word of the pattern D O _ E _. 
Possible candidates: DOPEY (P, Y not eliminated), DOVER (R eliminated), DOLER (L eliminated), etc.
DOPEY fits all constraints and uses only letters not yet ruled out.
Thus the next guess is DOPEY.
