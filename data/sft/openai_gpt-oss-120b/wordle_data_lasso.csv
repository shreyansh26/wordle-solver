### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that:
- S, L, and A are in the secret word but not in the positions we guessed them (positions 1,2,3 respectively).
- T and E are not in the word at all.

Thus we need a new word that includes S, L, and A, placed in different positions than before, and avoids T and E. A good candidate is **BALSA**:
- B A L S A uses A, L, S (none in the forbidden positions).
- No T or E are present.
- All letters form a valid English word.

From the feedback:
- Position 2 is definitely **A** (green).
- Position 4 is definitely **S** (green).
- **L** is in the word but not in position 3.
- There is at least one more **A** somewhere other than position 5 (the second A got a yellow).

We need a word that respects the known greens ( _ A _ S _ ), includes L (not in the 3rd slot), and tests where the extra A might be.  
A good candidate is **LASSO**:
- It has **L** in position 1 (satisfying “L not in pos 3”).
- It keeps **A** in position 2 (green).
- It places **S** in position 4 (green).
- It adds a new letter **O** to explore the unknown spot, and it does not repeat any forbidden letters (B, T, E).

This guess will tell us whether the secret word contains a second A and where the remaining letters belong.
