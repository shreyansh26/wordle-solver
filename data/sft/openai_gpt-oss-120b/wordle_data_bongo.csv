### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a guess that includes N and B, places them in allowed spots, and introduces new letters to test.

Word **BENDS** fits:
- B at position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- N at position 3 (one of the allowed spots for N).
- New letters D and S are tested.
- Only extra eliminated letter is E, which we already know is not in the word, but its presence won’t hurt the test of D and S.
Thus “BENDS” is a useful next guess.

We have established from the feedback that:
- B is correct in position 1 (B✓).
- N is correct in position 3 (N✓).
All other letters tested so far (C,R,A,E,U,T,Y,I,O,X,D,S) have been marked absent.

However, the only remaining plausible English words with the pattern **B _ N _ _** would need a vowel in the second, fourth or fifth position, and all standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U) have been marked absent. This suggests either:
- some earlier “x” markings were misleading (perhaps due to duplicate‑letter handling), or
- we need to test a vowel that might still be present.

To resolve this, I will guess a word that keeps **B** in position 1 and **N** in position 3, while re‑testing a vowel (A) and adding new letters. “BANAL” (B A N A L) satisfies this and introduces A (a vowel) and L (a new consonant) for further information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

We have confirmed that the secret word has **B** in position 1 and **N** in position 3. All standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and several consonants have been ruled out, leaving many unused letters (F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Z, etc.). No remaining common English word fits the pattern without using a vowel, so we need another guess that keeps B at position 1 and N at position 3 while testing new letters. 

Choosing a word that includes some of the still‑untested letters will give us more information. “BONGS” keeps B₁ and N₃, introduces G (still unknown) and uses letters we already know are not in the word (O and S) just to confirm their status.
