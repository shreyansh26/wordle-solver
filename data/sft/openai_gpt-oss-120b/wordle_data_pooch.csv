### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter because it contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know:
- C is in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from both guesses).
- All other letters guessed (R, A, N, E, M, U, S, I) are not in the word.
Thus the secret word must have C in position 2, 3, or 4, and the remaining four letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.).

A good candidate is **FLOCK**:
- C is in position 4, satisfying the constraint.
- The other letters F, L, O, K have not been ruled out.
- It’s a common English word, giving useful new information.

Therefore the next guess is “FLOCK”.
