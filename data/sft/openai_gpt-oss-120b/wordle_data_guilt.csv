### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I will start with a common starter word that contains a mix of frequent letters and varied positions to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a good initial guess because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This will help identify any correct letters early on.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent. I need a new five‑letter word that contains none of those letters. Choosing common letters that remain gives a good chance of hitting the secret word. The word **MIGHT** uses M, I, G, H, T – all permissible and includes both a vowel and frequently used consonants.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, H are not in the secret word.
- Letter T is correct in position 5.
- Letters I and G are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ""MIGHT"" (I not in position 2, G not in position 3).

We need a 5‑letter word ending with T, containing I and G, avoiding the excluded letters. The word **GUILT** fits:
- Ends with T.
- Contains G (position 1) and I (position 3), satisfying the placement constraints.
- Uses only allowed letters (G, U, I, L, T).

Thus we guess ""GUILT"".
