### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from the feedback on the first guess:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letter C is not in the word (x).
- Letter N is not in the word (x).
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (–). Therefore A can be in position 1 or 4.

We need a new word of the form _ R _ _ E that contains an A in position 1 or 4 and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “ARISE” fits perfectly:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- R and E are already known correct.
- I and S are new letters that will give us more information.

Thus the next guess is ARISE.

From previous feedback:
- Positions 1 and 2 are A and R respectively.
- Position 4 is S, position 5 is E.
- Position 3 is not I, C, N.
The only common English word fitting the pattern A R _ S E with a new third letter is **AROSE** (O in the third slot). This matches all known constraints, so the next guess should be AROSE.
