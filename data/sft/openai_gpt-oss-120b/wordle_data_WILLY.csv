### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, information‑rich starter word that contains a mix of frequently used letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and both a vowel (A) and another common vowel sound (E). This should give me useful feedback for the next steps.

We have the pattern from previous feedback: position 2 = I (✓), position 3 = L (✓), position 5 = Y (✓). So the secret word looks like _ I L _ Y.

Eliminated letters (x) are: A, B, C, E, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U. Also from earlier guesses F, K also x. So remaining possible letters for the unknown positions (1 and 4) are from {D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, L, I, Y} but L, I, Y are already placed, so we look at {D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z}.

Common English words fitting _ I L _ Y include **DILLY** (D I L L Y) and **GILLY** (G I L L Y). Both use allowed letters for the first and fourth positions.

Choosing one will test the remaining unknown letters. I’ll guess **DILLY** to see if D is correct for the first position and whether a second L belongs in the fourth position.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 3 = L (✓)
- Position 4 = L (✓)
- Position 5 = Y (✓)
- Position 1 is still unknown, and D was marked x, so D cannot be the first letter.

All letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, H, O, U, T, B, M, P, F, K, D.

Remaining possible letters for the first position are: G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, L (since L is known to be in the word). The word must be a valid English 5‑letter word of the form _ I L L Y.

Possible candidates include:

- LILLY (but “lilly” is typically a proper name; less likely to be in the official word list)

Given we have only one guess left, “GILLY” is a common dictionary word and fits the pattern, using G which has not been tried yet.
