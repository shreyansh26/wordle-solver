### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at any position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Thus the next word must contain an E somewhere in positions 1‑4, and must avoid using C, R, A, N. A good candidate is **SLEPT**: it includes E in the third slot and introduces new letters S, L, P, T that we have no information about yet.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 2 = **L** (✓ on guess SLEPT)
- Position 3 = **E** (✓ on guess SLEPT)
- Position 5 = **T** (✓ on guess SLEPT)

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word: C, R, A, N, S, P.

Therefore the secret word fits the pattern: _ L E _ T.

We need a guess that fills the unknown positions (1 and 4) with letters we haven't tested yet, while keeping the known correct letters in place. A common word that matches this pattern is **FLEET** (F‑L‑E‑E‑T). It uses new letters F and a second E, which will tell us whether the word contains a second E or if the first position is F.

So the next guess will be **FLEET**.
