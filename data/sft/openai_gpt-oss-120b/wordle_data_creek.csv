### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A is not in the word.

- CREEL (adds L, duplicate E)
- CREME (adds M, duplicate E)

Choosing a word that tests a new letter and also checks whether a second E appears will give the most information. **CREPE** introduces P (new) and places a second E at the final position.

Thus the next guess is:

<guess>CREPE</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

We have confirmed the first three letters are C R E. Feedback shows a second E exists but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4. Therefore the pattern is C R E E ?. The only common words fitting C R E E ? with the unknown fifth letter not yet eliminated are **CREEK** and **CREEL** (since D and P are eliminated). Guessing CREEK will confirm if the final letter is K; if wrong, we’ll know it must be L and can guess CREEL next.
