### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a good common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get useful information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it tests three frequent letters (C, R, N) and both the most common vowel (A) and a secondary vowel (E). This should give a solid base for the next steps.

We know the secret word has R in the second position. The letter E is present but not in the fifth position, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Letters C, A, and N are confirmed absent. A good next guess should keep R fixed, place E in a new slot, and introduce other common letters while avoiding C, A, N. “TRIED” fits: T R I E D (R second, E fourth, no forbidden letters). This will test T, I, D and confirm the location of E.

We know:
- R is correct in position 2.
- E is correct in position 4.
- D is in the word but not in position 5, so D must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, plus any letters not yet tried.

We need a word that respects R at 2 and E at 4, and tests D in the remaining possible slot (position 3) while introducing new letters. “ORDER” fits the pattern _ R D E _, placing D at position 3, keeping R and E fixed, and adds O and another R to test for a possible second R.

Thus the next guess should be:
