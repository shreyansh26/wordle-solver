### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to give me useful information about the secret word.  
“CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it covers the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

The feedback tells me that only the fourth letter N is correct; C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all. I need a new 5‑letter word with N in the fourth position and avoiding the eliminated letters. Choosing a word with new common letters will give the most information. “SHINY” (S‑H‑I‑N‑Y) satisfies these constraints and introduces several fresh letters.

- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)

Eliminated letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, E, H, Y.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **S _ I N _**, using letters other than the eliminated ones. A common English word fitting this pattern is **SLING** (S‑L‑I‑N‑G). L and G have not been ruled out, so this guess will test two new letters while keeping the known correct ones in place.
