### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 4: C (✓)
- Position 5: K (✓)

Letters eliminated (cannot appear anywhere): L, A, T, E, O, R, Y, H, I, and also I from position 3.

Thus the only unknown is position 3. It must be a letter not among the eliminated set and not already used (S, N, C, K). The word pattern is S N _ C K.

Possible common English words with that pattern:
- SNACK (A is eliminated) → invalid.
- SNICK (I is eliminated) → invalid.
- SNACK, SNICK, etc. None work.
- SNUCK (U) → ""snuck"" is a valid past-tense verb and uses U, which hasn't been ruled out.

Therefore the best next guess is SNUCK.
