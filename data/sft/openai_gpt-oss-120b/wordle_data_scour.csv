### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters C and R, but not in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"". Specifically, C cannot be the first letter and R cannot be the second letter. The letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

To gather more information, I’ll choose a word that includes C and R in new positions and introduces four other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. “ROCKS” places R at the first position (allowed) and C at the third position (allowed), and adds O, K, and S, which are all still possible.

We have the following feedback:

- From **CRANE**: C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. A, N, E are not in the word.
- From **ROCKS**: R, O, C, and S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 respectively. K is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain **C, R, O, S** plus one other letter (not A, N, E, K). Position restrictions are:

- Position 1: cannot be C or R.
- Position 2: cannot be R or O.
- Position 3: cannot be C.
- Position 5: cannot be S.

Looking for a common 5‑letter English word that uses C, R, O, S and fits these constraints, **SCROD** works:

- S in position 1 (allowed)
- C in position 2 (C is allowed here)
- R in position 3 (R is allowed here)
- O in position 4 (O is allowed here)
- D in position 5 (D is the extra letter, not excluded)

Therefore the next guess should be **SCROD**.

- The fifth letter must be a new allowed letter.
