### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. There are no constraints yet, so I’ll pick a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes both common consonants and vowels.

We know from feedback:
- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: cannot be L, unknown
- Position 3: A (correct)
- Position 4: T is in the word but not here, so T must be in position 2 or 5.
- Position 5: cannot be E.

Thus pattern: S _ A _ _. Include T at position 2 or 5. Choose a common word fitting this: “STAND” (S T A N D) satisfies all constraints and avoids letters known to be absent (L, E). This will give us more info.

From the feedback:
- Positions 1‑3 are known: S (✓), T (✓), A (✓).
- N got a “-” at position 4, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Since the only remaining open slots are positions 4 and 5, N must be at position 5.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: L, E, D.
