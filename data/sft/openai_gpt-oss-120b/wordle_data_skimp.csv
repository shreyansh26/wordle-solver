### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A common, well‑balanced word like “CRANE” contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent from the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that does not contain any of those letters. Choosing a word with common letters that haven’t been tested yet will give useful information. “GUILT” uses G, U, I, L, and T—all permissible letters—so it’s a good next guess.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, U, L, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter I is correct and in the third position.

Thus the secret word pattern is __I__ with no letters from the eliminated set.

We need a 5‑letter word fitting that pattern using only allowed letters (B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
A suitable word is **SKIMP** (S K I M P), which uses only permissible letters and has I in the third position.

Proceed with that guess.
