### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, N, G, L.
- Letters present but misplaced:
  * R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2.
  * A is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4.
  * E is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 5.

Thus possible positions:
- R can be 3, 4, or 5.
- A can be 1, 2, or 5.
- E can be 1, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word containing R, A, and E in those allowable spots, and filling the remaining two spots with letters that are not excluded.  

The word **EATER** fits:
- E at position 1 (allowed), A at position 2 (allowed), R at position 5 (allowed).
- The extra letters are E (again, allowed) and T (a new letter not excluded).
- No forbidden letters appear.

So ""EATER"" satisfies all the known constraints and is a common word to test further.

- Position 2 is still unknown, but it cannot be C, N, G, L, R, A, or E (those are either excluded or already placed). Any other common consonant works.

The pattern is therefore **E _ T R A**. A common English word that fits this pattern is **EXTRA**, using X as the new letter to test.
