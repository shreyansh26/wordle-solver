### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a 5‑letter word matching _ R O _ _. Choosing a word that introduces new, untested letters will give the most information. “PROWL” (P‑R‑O‑W‑L) uses three letters we haven’t tried (P, W, L) and fits the pattern, with none of its letters among the eliminated set.

Thus the next guess should be “PROWL”.

We have the following confirmed positions from feedback:
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 5: L (correct)

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, F, G, S, B, T, H, P, W.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4 are among D, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (note O is already used in position 3, but could also appear elsewhere).

We need a common 5‑letter word fitting the pattern _ R O _ L. The word “DROOL” matches:
- D (not eliminated) in position 1,
- R in position 2,
- O in position 3,
- O in position 4 (O is allowed),
- L in position 5 (correct).

Thus “DROOL” is a valid next guess.
