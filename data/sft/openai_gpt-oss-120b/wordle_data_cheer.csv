### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1 = C (✓ from COVER)
- Position 4 = E (✓ from COVER)
- Position 5 = R (✓ from COVER)

Feedback from CURER and CRYER tells us that R is only correct at position 5, so positions 2 and 3 cannot be R. Letters ruled out so far: A, I, S, O, V, U, Y (all received x).  

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **C _ _ E R** using only letters not eliminated. A common English word that matches this pattern and respects all constraints is **CHEER** (C‑H‑E‑E‑R). It uses only allowed letters, places the known E at position 4, and the known R at position 5, while introducing a new letter H at position 2.

Therefore the next guess should be CHEER.
