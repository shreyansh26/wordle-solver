### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that C, A, and N are not in the secret word. The letters R and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in CRANE, so R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5. For the next guess we need a valid 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions (avoiding those forbidden spots) and does not contain C, A, or N. “SHRED” satisfies all constraints: it contains R (position 3) and E (position 4), avoids the excluded letters, and places R and E in allowable spots.

   - E is correct in position 4.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 (and from step 1 we already know R is not position 2), so R must be position 5.

The only unknown slot is position 3. The letters ruled out so far are C, A, N, H, D, W, plus any letters already placed (S, O, E, R). We need a common English word of the form **S O _ E R**.

Possible candidates: **SOBER**, **SOVER** (not common), **SOTER** (rare), etc. “SOBER” is a well‑known word and uses B, which has not been excluded.
