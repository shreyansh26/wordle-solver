### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- E is correct at position 4 (from MONEY).
- N is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4 (from CRANE and MONEY). So N can be 1, 2, or 5.
- Letters C, R, A, M, O, Y are not in the word.
We need a new guess that keeps E at 4, places N in a possible remaining slot, and introduces new letters to test.

Choosing N at position 5 gives the pattern ___EN. A common word fitting this pattern and respecting the excluded letters is **SHEEN** (S H E E N). It keeps E at position 4, puts N at position 5, and adds the fresh letters S and H for testing.

Thus the next guess is:

We have confirmed:
- E is correct at position 4.
- N is correct at position 5.
- M is in the word but not at position 1 (from MONEY’s M(-)).
- Letters ruled out: C,R,A,O,Y,S,H,G,I,V.
Remaining possible letters include B,D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,T,U,W,X,Z, and also M (already known), plus maybe others not yet tried.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ E N with M somewhere other than the first position. The word **LUMEN** fits:
- L (new), U (new), M at position 3 (allowed), E at 4 (confirmed), N at 5 (confirmed).
- None of its letters are among the eliminated set.

Thus the next logical guess is LUMEN.
