### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a good mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is frequently used as an opening guess in Wordle‑style games because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both a vowel and several frequent consonants.

We have confirmed:
- Position 5 is **E** (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 3 is **C** (✓ from second guess).
- The secret word contains **N**, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5. So N must be in position 1 or 3, but 3 is already C. Therefore N is likely in position 1.
- Letters **R, A, U, L** are not in the word (all marked x).

Thus the pattern is **N _ C _ E**. We need a common English word fitting that pattern with letters not yet excluded. “NICHE” (N‑I‑C‑H‑E) satisfies all constraints:
- N at position 1, C at 3, E at 5.
- I and H have not been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters appear.

So the next guess should be “NICHE”.
