### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE resulted in all letters being marked as x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. Therefore the next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I’ll choose another common 5‑letter word using different letters. “GHOST” uses G, H, O, S, T, none of which were ruled out, so it’s a good candidate for the next try.

We have established the following from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T, U, P are not in the word (marked x).
- Letter S is in the word, and after the third guess we know S is correct at position 1 (S(✓) in SLUMP).
- Letter L is correct at position 2 (L(✓) in SLUMP).
- Letter M is correct at position 4 (M(✓) in SLUMP).
- Positions 3 and 5 are still unknown, and no letters have been ruled out for those spots besides the ones already marked x.
Thus the secret word has the pattern **S L _ M _**.

We need a valid English word that fits this pattern using only letters not eliminated. The word **SLIMY** fits:
- S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, M at position 4, Y at position 5.
- I and Y have not been tried yet, so they are permissible.

Therefore the next guess is SLIMY.
