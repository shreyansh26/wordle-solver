### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tries new letters to narrow down the remaining unknowns.  
A good candidate is **ROVER** (R at position 1, O at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5). This respects the known constraints and introduces O and V for further testing.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

1. Guess ""CRANE"": C, A, N are not in the word (x).  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (‑).  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (‑).

2. Guess ""ROVER"":  
   - R in position 1 is correct (✓).  
   - O is not in the word (x).  
   - V in position 3 is correct (✓).  
   - E in position 4 is correct (✓).  
   - R in position 5 is in the word but not at that position (‑).  

From this we know the secret word has the pattern:

- Position 1: **R** (confirmed)  
- Position 2: unknown, cannot be O, C, A, N, and is not R (since the second R is not at position 5).  
- Position 3: **V** (confirmed)  
- Position 4: **E** (confirmed)  
- Position 5: unknown, cannot be R, cannot be E (already used), cannot be O, C, A, N.

The letters we have ruled out so far: **C, A, N, O**.  
Letters confirmed in the word: **R, V, E** (R appears at least once, possibly twice, but not at position 5).

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern **R ? V E ?** and introduces new letters to test.  
A common word that matches is **RIVET**:

- Position 2 = I (new, not ruled out)  
- Position 5 = T (new, not ruled out)

This guess will confirm whether I and T are in the secret word and will also verify if there is a second R elsewhere (since position 5 is not R).

Therefore the next guess is “RIVET”.
