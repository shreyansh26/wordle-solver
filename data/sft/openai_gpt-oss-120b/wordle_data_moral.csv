### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains only the letters A and L from previous guesses. Their positions are limited:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and BALMY), so A can be 1, 4, or 5.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so L can be 1, 4, or 5 as well, but must occupy a different slot from A.

All other letters from the first two guesses (S, T, E, B, M, Y) are definitely not in the word.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes A and L in allowed positions and introduces three new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
A good candidate is **LUNAR**:
- L is at position 1 (allowed)
- A is at position 4 (allowed)
- The new letters U, N, R have not been tried yet and are not among the excluded set.

Thus this guess will confirm the positions of L and A and test three fresh letters.

Guess 2: BALMY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) L(-) M(-) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know the secret word contains only the letters A and L from previous guesses. Their positions are limited:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and BALMY), so A can be 1, 4, or 5.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so L can be 1, 4, or 5 as well, but must occupy a different slot from A.

All other letters from the first two guesses (S, T, E, B, M, Y) are definitely not in the word.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes A and L in allowed positions and introduces three new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
A good candidate is **LUNAR**:
- L is at position 1 (allowed)
- A is at position 4 (allowed)
- The new letters U, N, R have not been tried yet and are not among the excluded set.

Thus this guess will confirm the positions of L and A and test three fresh letters.

- A is correct at position 4.
- L is present but not in positions 1, 2, 3, so it must be at position 5.
- R is present but not at position 5, therefore R must be in one of the first three slots.
Thus the word pattern is **_ _ _ A L**, with **R** somewhere in the first three letters.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **VIRAL** (V I R A L):  
- A is in position 4 (matches).  
- L is in position 5 (matches).  
- R is in position 3 (satisfies the requirement that R is elsewhere).

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Position 4: A (correct)
- Position 5: L (correct)

Thus the word looks like __RAL.

Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, B, M, Y, U, N, V, I, plus any others that received an ""x"" in earlier guesses. Remaining unused letters that could occupy positions 1 and 2 include C, O, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, W, X, Z, etc.

A common English word that fits the pattern __RAL and uses only new letters is **CORAL** (C‑O‑R‑A‑L). Both C and O have not been eliminated, making this a strong candidate.

Therefore the next guess should be ""CORAL"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
