### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess I want a word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to provide maximum information about the secret word. A popular starter in Wordle-like games is **CRANE** because it includes the vowels A and E and the consonants C, R, N, which are frequent in English words. This should give me useful feedback for the next steps.

We know from the first guess that the letters C, R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all. Therefore the next guess must avoid using any of those letters. To maximize new information, I’ll choose a word with five different letters that are not among the excluded ones. “FIGHT” (F, I, G, H, T) satisfies this condition.
