The feedback shows that positions 2‑5 are A‑S‑T‑E, and the first letter is not P, W, B, or L. Viable common English words of the form _ASTE are:
- CASTE

Both fit the known constraints. I will guess ""CASTE"" to test the remaining possibility.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

- Position 4 is T (✓) and position 5 is E (✓).
- Letter S is in the word but not in position 1, so it can be 2 or 3.
- Letter A is in the word but not in position 3, so it can be 1 or 2.
- Letter L is not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ T E that contains S and A in the allowed spots.  
The word **PASTE** fits perfectly:
- P A S T E
- A is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 3 (allowed), T 4 and E 5 are already correct, and none of the letters are L.

Thus ""PASTE"" is a logical next guess.
