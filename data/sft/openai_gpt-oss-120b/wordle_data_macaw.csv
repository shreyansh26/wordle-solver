### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 2 (A✓).
- C is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, so C must be at position 3 or 5.
- Letters R, N, E, P, T, H are not in the word.
- We need to fill the remaining slots with letters that haven't been ruled out.

Choosing a word with the pattern _ A C _ _ (C in position 3) meets the constraints. “JACKS” fits:
- Position 1 J (untested)
- Position 2 A (✓)
- Position 3 C (C placed correctly)
- Position 4 K (untested)
- Position 5 S (untested)

All letters are allowed, and it tests three new letters (J, K, S).

Thus the next guess is “JACKS”.
