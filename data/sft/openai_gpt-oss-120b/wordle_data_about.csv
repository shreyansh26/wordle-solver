### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a typical opening guess in Wordle because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowel A and the letter E, giving good coverage for possible letters.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain A somewhere else (positions 1,2,4,5). Choose a guess that respects the exclusions and places A in a new spot, while testing new letters.

A good candidate is “WALDO”: 
- Contains A at position 2 (different from position 3).
- Includes letters W, L, D, O, none of which have been ruled out.
- Provides fresh letters to gain more information.

Proceed with this guess.

We know the secret word contains the letters A and O but not in the positions they have been tried:
- A: not in position 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from WALDO). So A can be in positions 1,4,5.
- O: not in position 5 (from WALDO). O can be in positions 1‑4.

All letters marked x are not in the word: C, R, N, E, W, L, D.

We need a new guess that includes A and O in fresh positions and tests new letters while avoiding the excluded ones.  
The word **ABOUT** fits:
- A is at position 1 (a new spot for A).
- O is at position 3 (different from the forbidden position 5).
- B, U, T are new letters not yet ruled out.

Thus ABOUT will give us more information about A, O and the new letters.
