### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 2 = O (✓ from COVER)
- Position 4 = E (✓ from COVER)
- D is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5 (both gave “-”), so D must be at position 3.
Thus the pattern is _ O D E _.  

Letters eliminated (x): S, L, A, T, C, V, R, B, N, P, Y.  
Remaining usable letters for positions 1 and 5 are any that are not eliminated, e.g., F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Z, etc.

A common English word fitting the pattern is **MODEM** (M O D E M), using only allowed letters. This will test M in positions 1 and 5.
