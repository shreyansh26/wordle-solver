# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 4 = A (✓)

Letters known not to be in the word: C, N, V, L, P, Y.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **R E _ A _**, with the third and fifth letters being any not‑eliminated letters. A common English word fitting this pattern is **REHAB** (R‑E‑H‑A‑B), using only allowed letters (H and B have not been ruled out). This satisfies all constraints, so it is a logical next guess.

Current confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: R (✓)
- Position 2: E (✓)
- Position 4: A (✓)

From the last guess REHAB, we learned:
- H is NOT in the word.
- B is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Thus B must occupy the only remaining unknown slot, position 3.  
The pattern is now: R E B A _.

Position 5 must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out (C, N, V, L, P, Y, H are out) and can be any valid letter, including possibly R again.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **REBAR** (R E B A R).

So the next guess should be REBAR.
