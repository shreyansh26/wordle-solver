All letters in the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as not present. Therefore the secret word contains none of those letters. I need a new 5‑letter word using only letters that haven’t been eliminated. Choosing a common word with diverse letters will give the most information. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T – all fresh letters – and is a valid English word.
