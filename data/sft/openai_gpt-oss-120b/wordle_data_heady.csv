### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (‑ at position 5 means it exists elsewhere).
- Letters S, L, and T are not in the word at all (x).

Therefore the next guess must:
- Have A in the third slot.
- Include an E, but not in the fifth slot.
- Exclude S, L, and T.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **HEARD** (H E A R D): A is in the correct third position, E is in the second position (not fifth), and none of the forbidden letters appear.
