### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback on CRANE:
- C and R are not in the secret word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position relative to CRANE (positions 3,4,5 respectively).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Does not contain C or R.
2. Contains A, N, and E, each placed in a different position than in CRANE.
3. Uses other letters that are still possible.

So far we know:
- **A** is definitely at position 4.
- **N** cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from PANEL and SNEAK), so N can only be at position 1 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 (from CRANE, PANEL, SNEAK), so E can only be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters **C, R, P, L, S, K** are ruled out completely.

We need a word that fits the pattern with A fixed at the fourth spot, places N and E in the allowable positions, and uses only letters not ruled out.

The word **BEGAN** satisfies all conditions:
- Position 1 = B (allowed)
- Position 2 = E (E is allowed at position 2)
- Position 3 = G (allowed)
- Position 4 = A (A is confirmed here)
- Position 5 = N (N is allowed at position 5)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback on CRANE:
- C and R are not in the secret word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position relative to CRANE (positions 3,4,5 respectively).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Does not contain C or R.
2. Contains A, N, and E, each placed in a different position than in CRANE.
3. Uses other letters that are still possible.

The word **PANEL** fits these criteria:
- It includes A (now in position 2, not position 3), N (position 3, not position 4), and E (position 4, not position 5).
- It does not contain C or R.
- All letters are valid English letters.

Thus, PANEL is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: PANEL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C and R are not in the word. A, N, E are in the word but in wrong positions (A not 3, N not 4, E not 5).
- From PANEL: P and L are not in the word. A still not in position 2, N not in position 3, E not in position 4.

Combined position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1,4,5.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1,2,5.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1,2,3.

All three letters must occupy distinct positions.

Trying possible placements, the pattern **S N E A K** (word ""SNEAK"") satisfies:
- N at position 2 (allowed),
- E at position 3 (allowed),
- A at position 4 (allowed),
- No prohibited letters (C,R,P,L) appear.
Thus ""SNEAK"" is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: PANEL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
Guess 3: SNEAK -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) E(-) A(✓) K(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- **CRANE**: C and R are not in the word. A, N, E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- **PANEL**: P and L are not in the word. A, N, E still wrong positions.
- **SNEAK**: S and K are not in the word. N and E are still in the word but wrong positions. A is correct at position 4.

So far we know:
- **A** is definitely at position 4.
- **N** cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from PANEL and SNEAK), so N can only be at position 1 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 (from CRANE, PANEL, SNEAK), so E can only be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters **C, R, P, L, S, K** are ruled out completely.

We need a word that fits the pattern with A fixed at the fourth spot, places N and E in the allowable positions, and uses only letters not ruled out.

The word **BEGAN** satisfies all conditions:
- Position 1 = B (allowed)
- Position 2 = E (E is allowed at position 2)
- Position 3 = G (allowed)
- Position 4 = A (A is confirmed here)
- Position 5 = N (N is allowed at position 5)

All letters are permissible and the placement respects the known position constraints.

Thus “BEGAN” is a logical next guess.

We have determined the secret word's letters and positions from previous feedback:
- Position 2: E (correct)
- Position 3: G (correct)
- Position 4: A (correct)
- Position 5: N (correct)
- Position 1 is not B and cannot be any letters already ruled out (C, R, P, L, S, K, B).

The only plausible English word fitting the pattern _EGAN is **VEGAN** (V E G A N). V has not been eliminated, and ""VEGAN"" is a valid common noun.

Thus the next guess should be VEGAN.
