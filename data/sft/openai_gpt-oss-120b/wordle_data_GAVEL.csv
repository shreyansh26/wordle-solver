### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- S and T are not in the secret word.
- L, A, and E are in the secret word but are not in the positions they occupied in “SLATE”.
  * L is not in position 2.
  * A is not in position 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains L, A, and E in different positions respecting those constraints, and introduces two new letters to test. “PANEL” fits:

We have confirmed the secret word pattern is ? A ? E L, with positions 2=A, 4=E, 5=L all correct. Positions 1 and 3 are still unknown. Letters tried and ruled out for any position are: S, T, P, N, H, Z, C, M (all marked x). So the remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 are any not in that exclusion list.

We need a common English word matching the pattern, introducing new letters for the unknown spots. Candidates include:
- BAGEL (B at 1, G at 3)
- RAVEL (R at 1, V at 3)

Both fit the pattern and test new letters. Choosing BAGEL tests B and G, which are common and not yet excluded, giving us useful information.

Thus the next guess is BAGEL.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- S and T are not in the secret word.
- L, A, and E are in the secret word but are not in the positions they occupied in “SLATE”.
  * L is not in position 2.
  * A is not in position 3.
  * E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains L, A, and E in different positions respecting those constraints, and introduces two new letters to test. “PANEL” fits:
- Contains L, A, E.
- Places L at position 5 (allowed), A at position 2 (allowed), E at position 4 (allowed).
- Adds new letters P and N for more information.
Thus “PANEL” is a logical next guess.
