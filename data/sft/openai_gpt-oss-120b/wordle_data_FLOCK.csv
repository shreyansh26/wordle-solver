### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes C somewhere other than the first slot and avoids the excluded letters. “MUSIC” satisfies these conditions: it has C in the last position and uses only letters M, U, S, I that haven’t been ruled out.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from MUSIC). Therefore C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

All letters R, A, N, E, M, U, S, I have been ruled out entirely, so our next guess must avoid those letters.

We need a word that:
- Includes C in position 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus C).

“FLOCK” fits these criteria:
- Contains C in position 4 (valid).
- All other letters F, L, O, K are not among the eliminated letters.

Thus “FLOCK” is a strong next guess.
