### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I'll start with a common starter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. ""CRANE"" has the consonants C, R, N and the vowels A, E. This should give a good spread for the first feedback.

We know the secret word includes letters C, A, N, and E (each marked with “-” meaning present but wrong position) and does not contain R. Their positions from the first guess (CRANE) are:
- C cannot be in position 1
- A cannot be in position 3
- N cannot be in position 4
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a five‑letter word that contains C, A, N, E in different positions and adds one more letter. “PECAN” fits perfectly:
- P E C A N
- E is in position 2 (not position 5)
- C is in position 3 (not position 1)
- A is in position 4 (not position 3)
- N is in position 5 (not position 4)
All constraints are satisfied, and the word is a common English word.

Thus the next guess should be “PECAN”.
