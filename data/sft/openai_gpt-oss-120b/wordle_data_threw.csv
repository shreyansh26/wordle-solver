### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word (x).
- R and E are in the word but in different positions (‑).
- R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E, excludes C, A, N, and does not place R at position 2 or E at position 5.  
The word **VOTER** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains R (position 5) and E (position 4).  
- No C, A, N.  
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

We have the following information from the feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- From guess 2 (VOTER): V and O are not in the word. E is correct in position 4. R is in the word but not in position 5 (and we already know it isn’t in position 2). T is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must:
- Have **E** at position 4.
- Contain **R** (position 1 or 3) and **T** (position 1, 2, or 5, but not 3).
- Exclude the letters C, A, N, V, O.
- Be a valid English 5‑letter word.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **THREW**:
- T is at position 1 (allowed).
- H is a new filler letter (not prohibited).
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- W is at position 5 (allowed).

All letters meet the known constraints, so “THREW” is a good next guess.
