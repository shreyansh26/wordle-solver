### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and varied positions to give useful information. “CRANE” is a frequently used starter, containing common consonants and vowels.

We know from the feedback that the third letter is A and the letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all. The next guess should keep A in the third position and avoid using C, R, N, and E. Choosing a word with new letters will give us more information. “SHALT” fits: it’s a valid 5‑letter word, has A in the third slot, and introduces S, H, L, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We know from feedback:
- Position 1: S is correct (✓)
- Position 2: H is correct (✓)
- Position 3: A is correct (✓)
- Position 4: L is in the word but wrong place (-), so L cannot be in position 4.
- Position 5: T is not in the word (x)

Letters C, R, N, E are also not in the word.

Thus the word pattern is S H A _ L, with L forced into position 5 (the only remaining slot). We need a common word fitting ""SHA?L"". ""SHAWL"" fits and uses a new letter W, which hasn't been ruled out.

So guess ""SHAWL"".
