# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letter L is in the word but not in position 1 (from LIMES), so L must be in positions 2‑5.

We need a 5‑letter English word that contains both E and L, respects those position constraints, and avoids the excluded letters.

- Contains E at position 2 (allowed) and L at position 3 (allowed).
- Uses only letters V, E, L, D, T, none of which have been ruled out.

From the feedback we have:

- Letters marked **x** are not in the secret word: C, R, A, N, I, M, S, V, D, T, B, O.
- Letters marked **-** are in the word but in the wrong position: **E**, **L**, **W**.

Position constraints:
- **E** was tried in positions 5, 4, 2, 1 → E cannot be in 1, 2, 4, 5, so E must be in position 3.
- **L** was tried in positions 1, 3, 2 → L cannot be in 1, 2, 3, so L must be in position 4 or 5.
- **W** was tried only in position 5 → W cannot be in position 5, so W can be in 1, 2, 3 or 4, but position 3 is taken by E.

Thus the pattern is:

- Position 3 = **E**
- Position 4 or 5 = **L**
- **W** somewhere in positions 1, 2 (or 4 if L is at 5).

Looking for a real English word that satisfies these placements and avoids all excluded letters, the word **WHELP** fits:

- W  H  E  L  P
- Position 1 = W (allowed, not position 5)
- Position 3 = E (the only allowed spot for E)
- Position 4 = L (L in a valid spot)
- Remaining letters H and P are not among the excluded letters.

Therefore the next guess should be **WHELP**.
