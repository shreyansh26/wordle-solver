### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the previous feedback:
- The letter **I** is correct and in the 3rd position.
- The letter **R** is in the word but not in the 2nd position (so it could be 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Letters **A**, **S**, and **E** are not in the word.

A good next guess should keep **I** in the 3rd slot, include **R** in a different position, and avoid A, S, E.  
The word **CLING** satisfies the position for I, introduces new letters (C, L, N, G) for testing, and deliberately leaves out **R** for now so we can see if other letters are present before confirming R’s exact spot.

Thus the next guess is **CLING**.

We have determined the following from feedback:
- I is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 4.
- L is correct at position 5.
- W is in the word but not at position 1, so it must be at position 2.
Thus the pattern is _ W I R L.

The only common English word matching this pattern that hasn't been eliminated is **TWIRL** (T W I R L). T has not been guessed yet, and all other letters fit the known constraints.
