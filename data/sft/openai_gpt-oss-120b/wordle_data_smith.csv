### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R) and three frequent vowels (A, E) plus N. This should give useful information about the secret word.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word. I need a new five‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely. Choosing a word with common letters will give useful information. ""MIGHT"" uses M, I, G, H, T, none of which have been ruled out, so it’s a good next guess.

We have letters ruled out: C,R,A,N,E,G. From CRANE all are not in the word. From MIGHT we know M, I, H, T are in the word but each is in the wrong position compared to that guess. So the secret word contains exactly those four letters plus one other unknown letter (not among the excluded). We need a guess that includes M, I, H, T in positions different from MIGHT and adds a new letter to test. The word ""SMITH"" uses those four letters plus S, and places each of M, I, H, T in new positions (M at 2, I at 3, T at 4, H at 5), respecting the position constraints.
