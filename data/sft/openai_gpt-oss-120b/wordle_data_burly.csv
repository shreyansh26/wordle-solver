### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter word. A good initial guess is a common word that contains a mix of common letters to gather information about the secret word. “CRANE” is frequently used as a first guess in these games because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, and E, which are common and cover a variety of vowel/consonant positions. I’ll submit that as my first guess.

  - L is not in position 2.
  - U is not in position 3.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P (not in the word).

We need a 5‑letter English word that includes R, L, U in allowed spots and introduces two new letters while respecting the position restrictions.

The word **LURID** fits:
- L in position 1 (allowed, not position 2)
- U in position 2 (allowed, not position 3)
- R in position 3 (allowed, not positions 2 or 4)
- I and D are new letters not previously ruled out.

Thus “LURID” is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have established:
- U is correct at position 2.
- R is correct at position 3.
- L is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, D, plus from earlier guesses also S, P already ruled out.
We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ U R _ _. L must occupy position 4 or 5. A suitable common word is **FURLY** (F U R L Y), which satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters F and Y that have not been ruled out.

We have confirmed letters U (position 2), R (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5) are all correct. The only unknown is the first letter. All letters that have been marked x cannot be used: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, D, F. The first letter must be a consonant not eliminated.
