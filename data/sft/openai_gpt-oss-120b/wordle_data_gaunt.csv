### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess ""crane"" we have:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word has the pattern _ _ _ N _ with an A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Choosing a word that fits this pattern, avoids C, R, and E, and includes A, I pick **SAINT** (S A I N T). It satisfies all constraints.

We have determined that the secret word fits the pattern ? A U N T, with positions 2‑5 confirmed as A, U, N, T. The first letter cannot be H, C, R, E, S, I, D. Remaining plausible letters for the first position that form a real word are G (GAUNT) and J (JAUNT). Both are valid English words and have not been ruled out yet. I will guess one of them to identify the correct first letter.
