### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains R and E, but not at the positions they appeared in the first guess (R not in position 2, E not in position 5). The letters C, A, and N are confirmed absent. To gain more information, we should pick a word that includes R and E in different spots and introduces new letters to test. “OLDER” places E in position 4 and R in position 5, both different from the previous locations, and adds O, L, D as fresh candidates.

We have determined the secret word ends with ""ER"" because:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): R is present but not in position 2, E is present but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (OLDER): E is correct in position 4, R is correct in position 5.

Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, O, L, D.

Thus the pattern is ___ER, with the first three letters unknown and must avoid the excluded letters. A good candidate that uses none of the excluded letters is **GIVER** (G I V E R). This will test three new letters (G, I, V) while keeping the known correct suffix.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out. A common English word fitting **S _ _ E R** and using only unused letters is **SHEER** (positions: S‑H‑E‑E‑R). Letter H has not been tried, and a second E is permissible since we only know the word contains at least one E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the pattern S _ _ E R from previous feedback:
- Position1 S is correct (✓).
- Position4 E and Position5 R are correct (✓).
- Position2 H was marked x, so H is not in the word.
- Position3 had an E marked '-', indicating E exists but not in that position; this is consistent with the known E at position4, and does not forbid another E elsewhere.

All letters marked x (absent) are: C, A, N, O, L, D, G, I, V, U, P, H.  
Thus the remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 3 are from {B, F, J, K, M, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, …} plus possibly another E.

A common English word fitting S _ _ E R and using only allowed letters is **SEWER** (S‑E‑W‑E‑R). It respects all known constraints and introduces the new letter W.

Therefore the next guess should be SEWER.
