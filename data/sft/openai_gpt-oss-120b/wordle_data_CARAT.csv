### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the first feedback:
- S, L, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain A and T, with A somewhere other than the 3rd slot and T somewhere other than the 4th slot. We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and T, avoids S, L, and E, and introduces new letters to gather more information. “PATCH” fits these criteria (contains A and T in new positions, and adds P, C, H which we haven’t tested yet).

We know:
- A is confirmed at position 2 (A✓ from PATCH).
- T is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4. So T can be at position 1 or 5.
- C is in the word but not at position 4, so C can be at positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, P, H.

A good candidate that fits these constraints and uses new letters is **CARAT**:
- C at position 1 (tests C’s placement).
- A at position 2 (already confirmed).
- R at position 3 (new letter).
- A at position 4 (duplicate A is allowed for testing).
- T at position 5 (tests T’s placement).

This guess will tell us whether T belongs at position 5 (or must be at 1) and will confirm C’s location while introducing new letters R.
