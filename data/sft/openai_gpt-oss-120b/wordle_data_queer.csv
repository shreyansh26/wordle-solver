# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from feedback:

- E is correct at position 4.
- R is correct at position 5.
- R is not in positions 1‑3 (confirmed by earlier “-” clues).
- U is in the word but not at position 1 (the “-” from USHER).
- Letters eliminated (not in the word): C, A, N, P, I, L, O, D, S, H, plus any others shown as “x”.
- Thus the remaining unknown letters must come from the unused alphabet, and the pattern is either **?U?ER** (U in position 2) or **??UER** (U in position 3).

Considering common English 5‑letter words that fit **?U?ER**, **TUBER** matches all constraints:
- Position 1 = T (not eliminated)
- Position 2 = U (allowed, not position 1)
- Position 3 = B (not eliminated)
- Position 4 = E (confirmed)
- Position 5 = R (confirmed)

All letters are permissible and no eliminated letters appear. Therefore the next guess should be **TUBER**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and places R and E away from the prohibited slots. ""PERIL"" fits: it contains R (position 3) and E (position 2), uses none of the excluded letters, and respects the position constraints.

- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

All other letters tried (C, A, N, P, I, L) are not in the word.

We need a new guess that includes R and E in allowed spots and avoids the excluded letters.  
Choosing **RODEO** gives:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- The other letters O, D, O have not been ruled out.

Thus “RODEO” satisfies all current constraints and introduces new letters for testing.

Thus the word pattern is ___ER, with positions 1‑3 needing letters not among the eliminated set.

A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **USHER** (U, S, H are not eliminated). This will test three new letters and satisfy the known constraints.

We will guess USHER.

- The remaining unknown letters are positions 1 and 3, and they must be chosen from letters not yet eliminated.
