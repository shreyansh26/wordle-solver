### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- The word ends with **E** (position 5 is correct).
- The secret word must contain **C** and **N**, but not at the positions they were guessed:
  * **C** is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from UNCLE) → C can be in positions 2 or 4.
  * **N** is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from UNCLE) → N can be in positions 1 or 3.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, A, U, L.
- Other letters are still unknown.

A word that fits all these constraints is **HENCE**:
- Positions: H(1) E(2) N(3) C(4) E(5)
- Ends with E, includes C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in allowed spots.
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out (H and a second E are permissible).

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- The secret word must contain **C** and **N**, but not at the positions they were guessed:

A word that fits all these constraints is **HENCE**:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have confirmed the pattern:

The first letter is still unknown. Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, A, U, L, H, S, W.  

Possible English words fitting “_INCE” and using allowed letters are limited. The common ones are:
- MINCE
- PINCE (rare, mostly a proper noun)
- BENCE (a surname)
- VINCE (a proper name)

The most common valid English word is **MINCE**, which also hasn’t been eliminated. Therefore the logical next guess is MINCE.
