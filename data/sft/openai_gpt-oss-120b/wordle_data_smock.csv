### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter.

The feedback tells me that the secret word contains the letter C, but C is not in the first position. All other letters from the first guess (R, A, N, E) are not in the word at all. I need a new five‑letter word that includes C somewhere other than the first slot and avoids using R, A, N, E. “SCOUT” fits: it has C in the second position and uses only new letters (S, O, U, T). This should give more information about the remaining letters.

We have:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 3 is O (✓).
- Letter C is in the word but not in position 2 (since it got a “-” at position 2), so C must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters R, A, N, E, U, T are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: S _ O _ _.  
C must occupy either the 4th or 5th slot.  
We need a valid English word fitting S?O?? with C in position 4 or 5 and using none of the excluded letters.

Two good candidates are **SMOCK** (S M O C K) and **SHOCK** (S H O C K). Both satisfy the pattern and introduce new letters for testing. I’ll guess **SMOCK** to learn about M and K.
