### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but not in position 3 (the position it occupied in CRANE). Therefore our next guess must include A in a different spot and avoid the letters C, R, N, E entirely. A common 5‑letter word that satisfies this is **ADULT**: A is in position 1, and the other letters D, U, L, T have not been ruled out yet.

From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, L, T.
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A (not in positions 1 or 3), D (not in position 2).

So the secret word must contain A and D, with A allowed in positions 2, 4, or 5, and D allowed in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).  
Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints and avoids all eliminated letters leads to the candidate **DAMPS**:
- D is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M, P, S are new letters not yet ruled out.
Thus “DAMPS” fits all current information.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, L, T, P, S.
- Letters that are in the word:
  * A is in the word and is correctly placed at position 2 (A✓).
  * D is in the word but not in position 1 (D−) → D can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  * M is in the word but not in position 3 (M−) → M can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- The secret word must therefore have the pattern: _ A _ _ _.
- It must contain the letters D and M, with the position restrictions above, and must avoid all eliminated letters.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **MADAM**:
- Position 2 is A (matches the confirmed A✓).
- D is at position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- M appears at positions 1 and 5 (allowed, not position 3).

Thus “MADAM” is a valid next guess.
