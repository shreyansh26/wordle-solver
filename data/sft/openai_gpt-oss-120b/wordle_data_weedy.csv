### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does **not** contain C, R, A, or N. The letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E somewhere in positions 1‑4.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.
A good choice is **BLEED** (B L E E D), which satisfies all constraints.

We have:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (BLEED): B and L are not in the word. The E at position 3 is correct (✓). The second E (position 4) is in the word but not at position 4, meaning the secret contains at least two E's. D is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus far:
- Known letters: E (at least two), D.
- Fixed position: position 3 = E.
- Forbidden positions: E not at 5, E not at 4; D not at 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, L.

We need a new word that:
1. Keeps E at position 3.
2. Places another E somewhere other than 4 or 5 (so positions 1 or 2).
3. Includes D in a position other than 5 (positions 1, 2, 4 are possible).
4. Introduces new letters to test.

A good candidate is **HEEDS** (H‑E‑E‑D‑S):
- Position 3 = E (✓).
- Second E at position 2 (different from forbidden positions).
- D at position 4 (allowed).
- Introduces H and S for further info.
