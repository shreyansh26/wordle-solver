### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of frequent letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E). This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 5 is E (correct).
- C is in the word but not position 1, so C must be at position 3 or 4.
- Letters A and N are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is: _ R _ _ E, with C at position 3 or 4, and no A or N.  
A good word that fits this pattern and tests new letters is **TRICE** (T R I C E). It places C at position 4, introduces T and I for new information, and respects all known constraints.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1: T (correct)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 4: C (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)
- Position 3 is unknown, but must be a letter not previously ruled out (A, N, I are out).

A common word fitting T R _ C E is ""TRUCE"", where the missing third letter is U, which hasn't been excluded.
