### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback:
- R is correct at position 2.
- C and A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _. It must contain N and E, with N not in slot 4 and E not in slot 5. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and avoids C and A is **GREEN** (G R E E N): R is in position 2, N is in position 5 (allowed), and E appears in positions 3 and 4 (allowed). This guess will test the remaining unknown letters.
