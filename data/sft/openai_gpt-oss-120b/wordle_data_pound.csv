### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the pattern **_ O U N D**:
- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 3 = U (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓)
- Position 5 = D (✓)

The first letter is still unknown. Letters that are ruled out for the first position are B, F, C, R, A, E, M, T (and any others that got an “x”). Viable English words with the pattern are:

- **SOUND**
- **HOUND**
- **POUND**
- **WOUND**

All first letters (S, H, P, W) are still possible. To isolate the correct one, I’ll guess **HOUND**, which introduces the new letter H and keeps the known OUND suffix.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Letters that have been tried and marked absent (x) include: C, R, A, E, M, T, B, F, H, and also the first letters of those guesses cannot be the secret word's first letter. Therefore the remaining possible first letters that fit a common English word ending in ""OUND"" are S, P, and W (since “MOUND” is invalid due to M, “BOUND”, “FOUND”, “HOUND” are all ruled out). The three viable words are **SOUND**, **POUND**, and **WOUND**. I will guess **SOUND** to test the remaining possibilities.
