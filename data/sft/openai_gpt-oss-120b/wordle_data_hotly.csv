### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain S, A, or E. It does contain L and T, but L is not in position 2 and T is not in position 4 (their positions in ""SLATE"").  

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes L and T in different slots, avoids S, A, E, and adds three other letters to test new possibilities.  

""LIGHT"" satisfies these constraints:
- Contains L (position 1, not the forbidden position 2)  
- Contains T (position 5, not the forbidden position 4)  
- Uses only new letters I, G, H besides L and T, none of which have been ruled out.  

Thus ""LIGHT"" is a good next guess.

We have the following constraints from the feedback:
- Letters S, A, E, I, G are not in the word.
- L, H, and T are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses.
  * L cannot be in position 2 (SLATE) nor position 1 (LIGHT) → possible positions: 3, 4, 5.
  * H cannot be in position 4 (LIGHT) → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5.
  * T cannot be in position 4 (SLATE) nor position 5 (LIGHT) → possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

A word that satisfies all these restrictions, uses only allowed letters, and contains L, H, and T is **HOTLY**:
- H in position 1 (allowed),
- O in position 2 (new, not ruled out),
- T in position 3 (allowed),
- L in position 4 (allowed),
- Y in position 5 (new, not ruled out).

All constraints are met, so “HOTLY” is a good next guess.
