### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters not in the word: C, A, E, I, D, S.

We need a new word starting with R, containing N in a new position, and avoiding the forbidden letters.  
Choosing **RHYMN** gives:
- R in the correct first spot.
- N at the last position (testing N = 5).
- Introduces new letters H, Y, M to gather more information.
All letters comply with the exclusions.

A valid English word that fits the pattern R _ _ _ N while using only allowed letters is hard to find among common words.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- C, A, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes R and N in different positions, avoids C, A, and E, and tries new letters to narrow it down.

“RINDS” fits:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- N is at position 3 (allowed).
- No prohibited letters are used.
- Introduces I, D, S for more information.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- R is correct at position 1.
- N is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4 (from previous feedback). It also cannot be at position 2? Actually not yet excluded; only excluded positions 3 and 4. So N could be at position 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, E, I, D, S.

We need a new word starting with R, containing N in a new position, and avoiding the forbidden letters.  
Choosing **RHYMN** gives:
- R in the correct first spot.
- N at the last position (testing N = 5).
- Introduces new letters H, Y, M to gather more information.
All letters comply with the exclusions.

So the next guess is “RHYMN”.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word of the form R _ _ _ N using only those allowed letters. “ROTON” (R‑O‑T‑O‑N) fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and introduces O and T for further clues.
