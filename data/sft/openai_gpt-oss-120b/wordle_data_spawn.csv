### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give a broad range of information about the secret word.

From the first guess CRANE we have:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is correct and in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word looks like __A__ with N somewhere except position 4. A good candidate that respects these constraints and uses only new letters is **SLAIN** (S L A I N), where N is at position 5. This will test several new letters while keeping A in the known correct spot.

We have determined the known letters:

- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: N (✓)

Eliminated letters from previous guesses: C, R, E, L, I.

Remaining unknown positions are 2 and 4. We need a common 5‑letter word of the form S ? A ? N that does not use any eliminated letters.

A suitable candidate is **SPAWN** (S‑P‑A‑W‑N):
- Uses new letters P and W for positions 2 and 4.
- Does not contain any eliminated letters.

Thus we guess SPAWN to test those positions.
