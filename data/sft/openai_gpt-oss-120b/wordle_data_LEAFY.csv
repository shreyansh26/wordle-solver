### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

We know:
- Position 3 must be A (from A✓).
- The letter E is in the word but not in position 5 (E-). So E can be in positions 1,2, or 4.
- Letters C and R are not in the word at all.

We need a five‑letter word that fits these constraints. “LEAST” satisfies:
- Position 3 = A.
- Contains E in position 2 (not position 5).
- No C or R.
Thus it’s a valid next guess.
