### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need to choose a new 5‑letter word that avoids all of those letters to get new information. I’ll pick a word with five fresh letters, preferably common ones. “MIGHT” (M, I, G, H, T) contains none of the excluded letters, so it’s a valid next guess.

We have these constraints from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H are not in the word.
- I is correct and in the second position.
- T is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret pattern is _ I _ _ _. T must be in position 1, 3, or 4. All other letters must avoid the excluded set.

A good guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters is **WITTY**:
- Keeps I in position 2.
- Places T in positions 3 and 4 (testing both possible spots).
- Introduces new letters W and Y, which haven’t been tested yet.
- Uses no letters that have been ruled out.

Thus the next guess will be ""WITTY"".

We have determined the exact positions of the known letters:
- Position 2 is I (✓ from previous guesses).
- Positions 3 and 4 are T (✓✓ from WITTY).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ from WITTY).

Thus the secret word follows the pattern _ I T T Y.  
All letters that have been marked “x” are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, W.

Choosing a word with a new first letter will give us new information while keeping the confirmed letters fixed. “KITTY” uses K (not yet tested) and maintains I‑T‑T‑Y in the correct spots.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H are not in the word.
- I is correct and in the second position.
- T is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret pattern is _ I _ _ _. T must be in position 1, 3, or 4. All other letters must avoid the excluded set.

A good guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters is **WITTY**:
- Keeps I in position 2.
- Places T in positions 3 and 4 (testing both possible spots).
- Introduces new letters W and Y, which haven’t been tested yet.
- Uses no letters that have been ruled out.

Thus the next guess will be ""WITTY"".
