### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it contains frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, which will give useful information about the secret word's letters and positions.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is correct at position 5.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending in E, containing R somewhere other than the second slot, and avoiding C, A, N. “STORE” fits these constraints (S‑T‑O‑R‑E): it ends with E, places R in position 4 (not position 2), and contains no excluded letters.

From the feedback:
- Letter E is confirmed at position 5.
- Letter R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4, so R must be at position 1 or 3.
- Letters C, A, N, S, T, O are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, with R at position 1 or 3, and avoiding the excluded letters. The word “RIDGE” fits:
- R is at position 1.
- I, D, G are unused letters and none are excluded.
- Ends with E at position 5.

Thus “RIDGE” is a valid next guess.
