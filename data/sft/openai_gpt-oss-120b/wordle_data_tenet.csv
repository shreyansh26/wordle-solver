### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- The N in position 4 is present but wrong place, confirming that N cannot be in position 4 and that the secret word must contain **another N** besides the one at position 3. The only remaining spots for this extra N are positions 1 or 5.

Thus the pattern is either **N E N _ _** or **_ E N _ N**.

Looking for common English words that fit **_ E N _ N** (since position 1 cannot be N due to lack of suitable words), the word **TENON** (T E N O N) satisfies:
- E in position 2, N in position 3, N in position 5.
- Uses only new letters T and O, which have not been ruled out.
- Contains no excluded letters.

Therefore the next guess should be **TENON**.

- Position 2: E (✓ from MENUS)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
