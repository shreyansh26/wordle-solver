### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C and R are not in the secret word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively).

Thus the secret word must contain A, N, and E somewhere else, and must avoid C and R. A good candidate that places these letters in new positions and introduces new letters would be **GLEAN**:
- G L E A N uses A, N, E in positions 4,5,3, none of which match their original positions.
- It contains no C or R.
- It adds new letters G and L to gather more information.

From guess 1 (CRANE): C and R are not in the word; A, N, and E are in the word but misplaced.
From guess 2 (GLEAN): G and L are not in the word; E is still misplaced; A is correct at position 4; N is correct at position 5.

- Position 5 = N (fixed)
- E is in the word but cannot be in position 3 (it was in position 3 of GLEAN) → E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Remaining unknown letters are positions 1, 2, 3, using letters not yet excluded (C,R,G,L).

A common English word satisfying these constraints is **ETHAN** (E‑T‑H‑A‑N): E is in position 1, A and N are correctly placed, and the other letters (T, H) have not been ruled out.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: GLEAN -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(x) E(-) A(✓) N(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From guess 1 (CRANE): C and R are not in the word; A, N, and E are in the word but misplaced.
From guess 2 (GLEAN): G and L are not in the word; E is still misplaced; A is correct at position 4; N is correct at position 5.

Thus we have:
- Position 4 = A (fixed)
- Position 5 = N (fixed)
- E is in the word but cannot be in position 3 (it was in position 3 of GLEAN) → E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Remaining unknown letters are positions 1, 2, 3, using letters not yet excluded (C,R,G,L).

A common English word satisfying these constraints is **ETHAN** (E‑T‑H‑A‑N): E is in position 1, A and N are correctly placed, and the other letters (T, H) have not been ruled out.

- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 → must be position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters so far: C, R, G, L, T, H.
- Need to fill positions 1‑3 with letters not excluded, keeping E in pos 1 or 2.

A common word that satisfies these constraints is **EVIAN**:
- E is at position 1 (allowed).
- V and I are new letters not yet ruled out.
- A and N are correctly placed at positions 4 and 5.

Thus EVIAN fits all known feedback and introduces two new letters for further clues.

We have determined:
- Position 4 = A (confirmed from GLEAN and ETHAN).
- Position 5 = N (confirmed).
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 1,3,5 → must be position 2.
- Letters eliminated so far: C, R, G, L, T, H, V, I (all marked x).
Thus the pattern is _ E _ A N with only letters not yet ruled out allowed in positions 1 and 3.
A common English word fitting this pattern is **SEDAN** (S‑E‑D‑A‑N). It uses new letters S and D, both still possible, and satisfies all earlier feedback.
