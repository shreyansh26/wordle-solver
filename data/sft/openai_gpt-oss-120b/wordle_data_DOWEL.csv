### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified that the secret word must contain the letters L and E, but:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3.

A word that fits these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LIVER**:

We have determined from the feedback:
- The secret word contains L and E.
- E is correct at position 4 (✓).
- L is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? Actually L is not in positions 1‑3 (all gave ‘-’). Since position 5 is still open, L must be at position 5.
Thus the pattern is ___EL, with L at the last spot and E at the fourth.

All other letters guessed (S, A, T, M, O, N, I, V, R) are ruled out. Remaining possible letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and also E/L in their fixed spots).

A common English word that matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **EXCEL** (E X C E L). It places E at positions 1 and 4, L at position 5, and introduces new letters X and C which have not been eliminated.

Therefore the next guess should be “EXCEL”.

We have determined:
- Letter E is correct at position 4 (✓) and not at positions 1,2,5.
- Letter L is correct at position 5 (✓) and not at positions 1‑3.
Thus the secret word pattern is ___EL.

All letters that have received an “x” are not in the word: S, A, T, M, O, N, I, V, R, X, C, and also the letters that got “-” are in the word but not at those positions (L, E already accounted for).

Remaining possible letters for positions 1‑3 are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z (and possibly others like L/E which are already fixed).

A common English word that fits the pattern ___EL with allowed letters is **WHEEL**:

- H (position 2) – not excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A word that fits these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LIVER**:

- Position 5 is **L** (✓ from EXCEL and confirmed by later guesses).
- Letter **W** is in the word but not in position 1 (W(-) from WHEEL), so W must be in position 2 or 3.
