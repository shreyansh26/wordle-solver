### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. “CRANE” is a popular first guess because it tests two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

We know:
- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Letters A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- C and N are not in the word.

We need a new guess that keeps R in position 2, includes A and E in different positions (avoiding their excluded spots), and introduces new letters to gain more information.  

Word **BRAKE** satisfies these constraints:
- R stays in position 2.
- A is placed at position 4 (allowed).
- E is placed at position 5, but E was marked as “‑” for position 5, so we must avoid E at position 5.  
Instead choose **BRACE**:
- R at position 2 (✓).
- A at position 3 (but A cannot be at position 3 per feedback), so not good.

Try **B R E A K** (BREAK):
- R at position 2 (✓).
- A at position 4 (allowed).
- E at position 3 (allowed, only position 5 was excluded for E).
- Introduces new letters B and K for testing.

Thus, the next guess will be **BREAK**.
