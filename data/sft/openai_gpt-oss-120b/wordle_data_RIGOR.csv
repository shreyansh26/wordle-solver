### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E. It does contain an R, but R is not in the second position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore our next guess should:
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Include R in a different slot (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SLURP**:
- It avoids the banned letters.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, L, U, P, D.
- R is in the word and is correctly placed at position 1 (R✓). It is not in positions 2 or 4 (R- previously).
- I is correctly placed at position 2 (I✓). The second I in the guess got a “‑”, meaning I is elsewhere in the word but not at position 4. This suggests a possible second I, likely at position 5, but we’ll keep both possibilities open.
- G is correctly placed at position 3 (G✓).

So the pattern so far is **R I G _ _**.  
Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown, but they cannot be any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E, S, L, U, P, D). We need to test new letters there and also see whether a second I belongs at position 5.

A good candidate word that fits the known pattern and introduces a fresh letter (O) while also testing whether R could appear again at the end is **RIGOR** (R I G O R). This will tell us:

- If O is in the word and whether it belongs in position 4.
- Whether a second R at position 5 is present (it will be marked x if the secret word has only one R).
