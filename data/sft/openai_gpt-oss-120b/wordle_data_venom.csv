### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 2 = E (from GENUS).
- Position 3 = N (from MONEY and GENUS).

Letters ruled out (gray/x): C, R, A, M, O, Y, G, U, S, T, H, and also the repeated N in other spots (since only one N is green).  
E cannot be in position 4 or 5 (from CRANE and MONEY).  
N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE).  

Thus the pattern is **_ E N _ _** with allowed letters for the remaining spots being any letters not excluded above.

A common English word that satisfies all constraints is **BENJI**:
- B E N J I
- Positions 2 and 3 are correct (E, N).
- No prohibited letters are used.
- Position 4 (J) and 5 (I) are permissible.

Therefore the next guess is “BENJI”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Choosing a common word that meets these constraints, “MONEY” fits: it contains N (position 3) and E (position 4), uses none of the excluded letters, and respects the positional restrictions.
