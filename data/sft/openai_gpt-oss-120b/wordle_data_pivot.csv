### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, S, H, U are not in the word.
- Letter T is correct in position 5.
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus we need a 5‑letter word ending with T, containing O somewhere else (positions 1,2,4), and using only letters not eliminated.

The word **PILOT** fits:
- Ends with T.
- Contains O at position 4 (allowed).
- Uses only letters P, I, L, O, T, none of which have been ruled out.

So we’ll guess “PILOT”.

We have deduced the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1 = P (✓ from PILOT)
- Position 2 = I (✓ from PILOT)
- Position 3 is unknown, but L is not correct (x) and O cannot be here (since O is at position 4).
- Position 4 = O (✓ from PILOT)
- Position 5 = T (✓ from SHOUT and PILOT)

Thus the word is P I _ O T. Looking for a common English word fitting this pattern, ""PIVOT"" works, with V as the third letter, which hasn't been ruled out. So the next guess should be ""PIVOT"".
