### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback so far:
- Guess 1: CRANE → all letters marked x → C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
- Guess 2: BLOOM → B, L, O are x (not in the word); M is marked “-”, meaning M is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Thus the secret word:
- Contains the letter **M** somewhere in positions 1‑4.
- Contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, E, B, L, O.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes M (to test its position) and only uses letters outside the excluded set. A good candidate is **MIGHT** (M I G H T):
- M is present (testing position 1).
- I, G, H, T are all letters we have no information about yet and are not excluded.

This guess will tell us whether M is in position 1 and will introduce four new letters for further narrowing.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined which letters are not in the secret word from previous feedback:
- Not in word: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, O, I, G, H, T.
- M is in the word but not in positions 1 (from MIGHT) or 5 (from BLOOM). Therefore M must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains M in a middle position (2‑4).
2. Uses only letters not excluded.
Remaining usable letters are: D, F, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus M).
A valid English word meeting these criteria is **JUMPS** (J‑U‑M‑P‑S), placing M at position 3.
All its letters (J, U, P, S) are not among the excluded letters.
Thus this guess will test M’s exact position and introduce four new letters for further narrowing.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- J (position 1) is correct (✓)
- U (position 2) is correct (✓)
- M (position 3) is correct (✓)
- P (position 4) is correct (✓)
- Position 5 is still unknown; the letter S was guessed and marked x, so S is not correct.

All other letters that have been marked x (C,R,A,N,E,B,L,O,I,G,H,T) are not in the word. The remaining alphabet letters not yet ruled out include D, F, J, K, Q, S (ruled out), V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

The only common English word that fits the pattern ""JUMP_"" is **JUMPY**, using Y, which hasn't been excluded. Thus we guess ""JUMPY"" to test Y in the final position.
