### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A. It DOES contain N and E, but N is NOT in position 4 and E is NOT in position 5 (the positions they occupied in CRANE). So we need a new five‑letter word that includes N and E in different spots, avoids C, R, A, and tries new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **TENDS**:
- Contains N (position 3) and E (position 2), both different from the prohibited positions.
- Uses new letters T, D, S to test additional possibilities.
- No C, R, or A.

Thus we will guess “TENDS”.

We have determined from feedback that:

- The only possible position for E is the 4th letter (positions 1,2,3,5 are ruled out).
- N cannot be in positions 2,3,4, so it must be either position 1 or 5.
Thus the word pattern is either N _ _ E _ or _ _ _ E N.

Choosing a common word that fits the pattern N _ _ E _ and uses only unused letters, ""NOVEL"" (N O V E L) satisfies all constraints:
- N is at position 1,
- E is at position 4,
- O, V, L have not been eliminated,

Guess 3: ENEMY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) E(-) M(x) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined from feedback that:
- The secret word contains the letters N and E, and no other letters tried so far (C,R,A,T,D,S,M,Y are excluded).
- The only possible position for E is the 4th letter (positions 1,2,3,5 are ruled out).
- N cannot be in positions 2,3,4, so it must be either position 1 or 5.
Thus the word pattern is either N _ _ E _ or _ _ _ E N.

Choosing a common word that fits the pattern N _ _ E _ and uses only unused letters, ""NOVEL"" (N O V E L) satisfies all constraints:
- N is at position 1,
- E is at position 4,
- O, V, L have not been eliminated,
- No prohibited letters appear.

Therefore ""NOVEL"" is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- Present letters: N, E, V.
- E is correct at position 4 (✓).
- N is present but not at position 1 (‑ from NOVEL) and from earlier feedback not at positions 2, 3, 4, leaving N at position 5.
- V is present but not at position 3 (‑ from NOVEL). Thus V must be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters known not to be in the word: C, R, A, T, D, S, M, Y, O, L (all marked x).

So the pattern is:

1 ?   (could be V)
2 ?   (could be V)
3 ?   (cannot be V)
4 E   (fixed)
5 N   (fixed)

A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **VIXEN** (V I X E N):
- V at position 1 (acceptable),
- I and X are new letters not yet excluded,
- E at position 4 matches the ✓,
- N at position 5 matches the required placement.

Thus the next guess should be VIXEN.
