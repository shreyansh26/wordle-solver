### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess “SLATE” tells us:
- S, L, and A are in the secret word but not in the positions they occupied in “SLATE”.
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So we need a new 5‑letter word that contains S, L, and A in different positions (S cannot be first, L cannot be second, A cannot be third) and avoids T and E.  
A good candidate is **LASSO**:
- It includes S, L, and A.
- None of those letters are in the same positions as in “SLATE”.
- It introduces a new letter O and repeats S, which will give us more information.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (SLATE): S, L, A are in the word but not in those positions; T and E are not in the word.
- From guess 2 (LASSO):  
  • L is in the word but not in position 1.  
  • A is correct in position 2 (✓).  
  • The first S is correct in position 3 (✓).  
  • The second S is in the word but not in position 4 (‑).  
  • O is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain A at the second slot and S at the third slot.  
L must appear somewhere other than the first position, and O, T, E are excluded.  
We do not yet know the remaining letters, so we can choose a word that satisfies the known constraints and also introduces new letters to test.

A good candidate is **BASIL**:
- A is at position 2 (✓).  
- S is at position 3 (✓).  
- L is present (position 5), satisfying the “L not in position 1” condition.  
- It contains no forbidden letters (O, T, E).  
- The extra letters B and I will give us more information.

Therefore the next guess should be “BASIL”.
