### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where it appeared in CRANE). Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 2 = A (confirmed)
- Position 3 = S (confirmed)
- Position 4 = T (confirmed)
- Position 5 = Y (confirmed)

Thus the word is _ASTY.

Letters already ruled out for position 1 (and overall) are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, B, L, M, H, and also N from guess1, etc. The only plausible English words fitting _ASTY and using letters not yet eliminated are:

- PASTY
- TASTY (would duplicate T)
- WASTY

To differentiate, we guess ""PASTY"", which tests a new first-letter candidate (P). If P is correct we solve; if not, we’ll know the first letter is T or W.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
