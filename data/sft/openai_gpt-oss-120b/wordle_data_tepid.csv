### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the Wordle-like game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. “CRANE” is a popular starting word for this reason.

The first guess “CRANE” gave feedback that C, R, A, N are not in the word at all, and E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore the secret word must contain the letter E somewhere in positions 1‑4, and cannot contain C, R, A, or N.

I’ll choose a new word that:
- excludes C, R, A, N,
- includes E in a position other than 5,
- introduces several new letters to gather more information.

“MULES” fits: it has M, U, L, E, S; no forbidden letters, and E is in position 4 (not position 5). This will test five new letters while respecting the known constraints.
