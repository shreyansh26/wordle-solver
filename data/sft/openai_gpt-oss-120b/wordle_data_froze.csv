### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word matches the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and cannot contain C, A, or N anywhere.

We need a five‑letter word with R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter, avoiding C, A, N. “PROBE” fits these constraints (P‑R‑O‑B‑E), and none of its letters are forbidden. It will give us new information about the remaining letters.
