# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C or N. It DOES contain R, A, and E, but each of those letters is NOT in the position they appeared in CRANE: R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.  

We need a new 5‑letter guess that includes R, A, and E in different positions and avoids C and N. A good candidate is **RAVEL**:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2)

- V and L are new letters to test and do not conflict with the excluded letters.

We have confirmed letters R, A, E, S are in the word, each in a different position from where they appeared in previous guesses.

- R cannot be positions 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5.
- A cannot be positions 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5.
- E cannot be positions 2,4,5 → must be 1 or 3.
- S cannot be position 5 → can be 1‑4.

Thus R and A occupy the two last spots (4 and 5) in some order, E occupies spot 1 or 3, and S occupies one of the remaining spots (not 5).  

A common English word satisfying all these constraints is **SHEAR**:

1 S (allowed, not 5)  
2 H (new letter)  
3 E (E allowed at 3)  
4 A (A allowed at 4)  
5 R (R allowed at 5)

All position restrictions are respected and no excluded letters appear. Therefore “SHEAR” is a logical next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 2: RAVEL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have letters confirmed present: R, A, E. Their excluded positions:
- R cannot be positions 1 or 2 (from guesses CRANE and RAVEL), so R can be 3,4,5.
- A cannot be positions 2 or 3, so A can be 1,4,5.
- E cannot be positions 4 or 5, so E can be 1,2,3.

We need a 5‑letter word containing A, R, E in allowed spots plus two new letters (not C,N,V,L).  
Choosing positions A‑1, E‑2, R‑3 satisfies all constraints. That gives the pattern **A E R _ _**.  
A common English word matching this pattern is **AEROS** (plural of “aero”). The remaining letters O and S have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess is AEROS.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed letters R, A, E, S are in the word, each in a different position from where they appeared in previous guesses.

- R cannot be positions 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5.
- A cannot be positions 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5.
- E cannot be positions 2,4,5 → must be 1 or 3.
- S cannot be position 5 → can be 1‑4.

Thus R and A occupy the two last spots (4 and 5) in some order, E occupies spot 1 or 3, and S occupies one of the remaining spots (not 5).  

A common English word satisfying all these constraints is **SHEAR**:

1 S (allowed, not 5)  
2 H (new letter)  
3 E (E allowed at 3)  
4 A (A allowed at 4)  
5 R (R allowed at 5)

All position restrictions are respected and no excluded letters appear. Therefore “SHEAR” is a logical next guess.
