# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Excluded letters (x): C, N, V, L, B, D.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ A _ E R**.

We need to test the remaining unknown letters (positions 1 and 3) with new candidates that avoid the excluded letters. A common word that matches the pattern and introduces new letters is **PAPER** (P A P E R). This will confirm whether P is in the word and its correct placement.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 1: P (✓ from PAPER)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)
- Position 3 is still unknown. It cannot be P (the third letter of PAPER got “-”, indicating P is elsewhere, which we already have at position 1). It also cannot be any letters previously marked absent: C, N, V, L, B, D.

Thus the word is **P A _ E R**. We need a common 5‑letter word matching that pattern and introducing a new plausible letter in the third spot. Possible candidates include *PATER*, *PAYER*, *PAGER*, *PARER*, etc. I’ll choose **PATER**, which uses a new letter (T) and fits the pattern.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
