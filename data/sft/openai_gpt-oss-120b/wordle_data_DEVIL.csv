### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. The letter E is present but not in the 5th position (since it was marked “-” in CRANE where E was fifth). Therefore, our next guess should:

- Exclude C, R, A, N.
- Include E in a position other than 5.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SHELF**: it contains E in the 3rd slot, avoids the excluded letters, and adds new letters S, H, L, F for testing.

From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, H, F.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: E (not in positions 5 or 3), L (not in position 4).

Thus, E can be in positions 1,2,4; L can be in positions 1,2,3,5. Choose a word that places E and L in new positions while introducing new letters to test. The word “GELID” puts E at position 2 and L at position 3, both allowed, and adds G, I, D, which have not been tested yet.

We have these constraints from prior feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, H, F, G.
- E is correct at position 2.
- I is correct at position 4.
- L is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4 (from SHELF and GELID), so L can be at position 1 or 5.
- D is in the word but not at position 5.
Thus the pattern is: _ E _ I _.  
We need to place L and D in the remaining slots.  
If L is at position 5, D can go at position 1 (since D cannot be at 5). That gives the pattern D E ? I L.  
A common English word that fits is **DEVIL** (D‑E‑V‑I‑L). It satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter V for further testing.
