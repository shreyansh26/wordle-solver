### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word does not contain C or R. It does contain A, N, and E, but each of those letters is in the wrong position relative to the guess “CRANE”. Therefore:
- A cannot be in position 3,
- N cannot be in position 4,
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E in different positions, and avoids C and R. “LANES” fits:
- L A N E S → A is in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), and no C or R appear.
Thus “LANES” is a valid next guess.
