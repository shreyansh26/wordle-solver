### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to begin the word-guessing game with an initial 5‑letter guess. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. “ARISE” is a good starter: it includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). This should reveal which letters are present and possibly some correct positions.

We have the following information:

- Letters A, R, I, S, E, C, L, O are all marked x → they are NOT in the secret word.
- Letter U is marked “-” in position 4 → U is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Letter D is marked “-” in position 5 → D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Therefore the secret word must contain both **U** and **D**, with U somewhere in positions 1‑3 and D somewhere in positions 1‑4 (but not at 5). All other letters used so far are ruled out.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains U and D.
- Places U and D not in the forbidden positions.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (A,R,I,S,E,C,L,O).

A common word that satisfies these constraints is **DUMMY**:
- D is in position 1 (allowed, not position 5).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, not position 4).
- The other letters (M, Y) have not been ruled out.
