### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback:
- C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- M, I, H are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
    * M guessed at position 1 → M cannot be position 1.
    * I guessed at position 2 → I cannot be position 2.
    * H guessed at position 4 → H cannot be position 4.
- G and T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes M, I, H (each placed away from those forbidden positions) and adds two new letters that haven’t been ruled out. “SHIMS” fits:
- Contains H (position 2, not 4), I (position 3, not 2), M (position 4, not 1).
- Uses only letters S, H, I, M, S, none of which have been excluded.
- It’s a valid English word.

Thus the next guess should be “SHIMS”.

Thus the secret word must contain M, I, and H, placed in positions that obey those restrictions, plus two other letters that have not been ruled out.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **HUMID**:

All letters used are not among the excluded set, and the placement respects the known position restrictions. This guess will test the remaining possibilities for the two unknown letters while confirming the correct spots for H, M, and I.
