### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is E (from ZESTY).
- Position 4 is T (from ZESTY).
- Position 5 is Y (from ZESTY and earlier Y✓).
- Position 1 cannot be C,R,A,N,B,L,D,P,O,X,Z,S (all marked x) and also not E (already used). So it must be a new letter.
- Position 3 cannot be C,R,A,N,B,L,D,P,O,X,S (all marked x) and also not E (already used). So also a new letter.

Thus the word must fit the pattern _ E _ T Y with new letters at positions 1 and 3.

A common English word that fits is **HEFTY** (H E F T Y). H and F have not been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess is HEFTY.
