### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- The secret word contains R and E.
- E is correctly placed at position 4.
- R is correctly placed at position 5, and it is **not** in positions 1 or 2.
- Letters C, A, N, I, and D are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E R, with the only confirmed R at the last position. Positions 1‑3 must be letters other than C, A, N, I, D, and cannot be R (except possibly at position 3 if the word has a second R, but that is not required).

A common word that fits all these constraints is **POWER** (P O W E R). It uses only allowed letters and places E and R correctly.

Therefore, the next guess will be POWER.

We have confirmed:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 3 = V (since V must be in the word and cannot be position 1; the only remaining slot is position 3)
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

Pattern: _ O V E R

The only unknown is the first letter. Valid English words fitting this pattern are:
- HOVER
- LOVER
- MOVER

All other letters have been ruled out (C, A, N, I, D, P, W, T, V already placed, etc.). We need to test the first letter. I will guess “LOVER”, which will tell us if the first letter is L; if not, we still have one more attempt to try another candidate.
