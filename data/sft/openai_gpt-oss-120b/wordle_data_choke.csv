### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common opening word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a good choice because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowels A and E.

From the feedback:
- Position 1: C is correct.
- Position 5: E is correct.
- Letters R, A, N are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E, with none of the letters R, A, N appearing elsewhere. I need a common five‑letter word fitting C???E. “CLOSE” matches this pattern and introduces new letters (L, O, S) that haven’t been ruled out.
