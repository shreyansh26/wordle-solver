### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- The I at position 4 got a ""-"", meaning the letter I is somewhere else in the word; this could indicate a second I, but the game might treat duplicate letters differently. To stay safe we just need a word that respects the confirmed facts.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:
- Position 2 is definitely I (✓ from MIGHT and SILOS).
- Position 1 is S (✓ from SILOS).
- Position 3 is L (✓ from SILOS).
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, T, V, D, O (x’s).
- L is in the word but not at position 1 (dash from LIVID), which is satisfied by L at position 3.
- The second S in SILOS received a dash, meaning S appears elsewhere (position 1 already accounts for it), so no additional S is required.
- The duplicate I in LIVID got a dash, indicating the letter I exists in the word (already placed at position 2); we do not need a second I.

Thus the current pattern is **S I L _ _**.  
We need a common 5‑letter English word matching this pattern using only letters that have not been eliminated. “SILKY” (S‑I‑L‑K‑Y) fits perfectly: K and Y are still possible.

Therefore the next guess should be SILKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
