### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R and A, but not at the positions they were guessed in “crane”. Specifically:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new guess that includes R and A in different positions, and introduces new letters to gather more information while avoiding C, N, and E. A good candidate is **RAILS**:
- R is placed at position 1 (allowed).
- A is placed at position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be at 3).
- The remaining letters I, L, and S are new and will test other possibilities.

Thus the next guess is “rails”.

- Letter **I** is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters **C, N, E, L, S** are not in the word.

Thus the remaining pattern is either **RA_I_** (I in position 4) or **RA__I** (I in position 5).  
We need a word that keeps the known letters and introduces new ones to test possibilities.  
“RADIO” fits the pattern **RA D I O**, placing I in position 4 and adding two fresh letters **D** and **O** that we haven’t evaluated yet.

So the next guess will be “RADIO”.

Feedback for other letters:
- D is in the word but not in position 3, so D must be position 5.
- O is not in the word.
- L, S, C, N, E are also not in the word.

Thus the pattern is **R A _ I D**. The third letter is still unknown, but it cannot be any of the excluded letters. A common English word fitting this pattern is **RAPID** (with P as the new third letter). This will test the remaining unknown slot while keeping all known correct letters in place.

Therefore the next guess is RAPID.

- From previous feedback, we have:
  * Position 1: R (✓)
  * Position 2: A (✓)
  * Position 3: P is NOT in the word (x)
  * Position 4: I (✓)
  * Position 5: D (✓)
- Therefore the secret word follows the pattern **RA?ID**, with the third letter unknown.
- Excluded letters so far: C, N, E, L, S, O, P, plus any others marked x (C, N, E, L, S, O, P). B has not been tried and is not excluded.
- A common English word that fits the pattern is **RABID** (R‑A‑B‑I‑D).
- Guessing ""RABID"" will test the only remaining unknown slot while keeping all confirmed letters in place.
