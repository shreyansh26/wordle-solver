### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains the letters T and E (both present) and excludes S, L, A, I, G, R.  
From the feedback:
- T is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- E is NOT in positions 4 or 5.
Thus valid positions:
- T can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a five‑letter word using T and E placed in allowed slots, with three other letters that are not any of the excluded ones.  
The word **EVENT** fits:
- E at position 1 (allowed), E at position 3 (allowed), T at position 5 (allowed).
- Other letters V, N, and the second E are not among the banned letters.
Therefore EVENT is a valid next guess.
