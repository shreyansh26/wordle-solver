I need to start with a common, information‑rich 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in Wordle because it tests the vowel A and E and includes the frequent consonants C, R, and N. This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

We know the secret word has R in the 2nd slot, A in the 3rd, and E in the 5th: _ R A _ E. The letters C and N are confirmed not to be in the word. We need a common English word that matches the pattern and avoids C and N. “BRAVE” fits perfectly: B R A V E, with new letters B and V in the remaining positions.
