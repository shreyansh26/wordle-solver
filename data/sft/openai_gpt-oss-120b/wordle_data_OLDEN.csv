### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions (avoiding N in slot 4 and E in slot 5) and introduces fresh letters to test.  
The word **KNELT** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains N (position 2) and E (position 3), both away from the prohibited slots.
- Uses new letters K, L, T, which have not been ruled out yet.
- Avoids the eliminated letters C, R, A.

Thus it provides good information for the next round.

We know:

  * E appeared in position 5 of CRANE and position 3 of KNELT, so E cannot be in positions 3 or 5. Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4.

We need a five‑letter English word that contains N and E in allowed spots and uses three other letters that haven’t been eliminated.  
Choosing N at position 1 and E at position 2 satisfies the constraints, leaving positions 3‑5 for new letters.

- N is at position 1 (allowed).

- I, G, H are fresh letters not yet ruled out.
- No prohibited letters (C,R,A,K,L,T) appear.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions (avoiding N in slot 4 and E in slot 5) and introduces fresh letters to test.  
The word **KNELT** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains N (position 2) and E (position 3), both away from the prohibited slots.
- Uses new letters K, L, T, which have not been ruled out yet.
- Avoids the eliminated letters C, R, A.

Thus it provides good information for the next round.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know:
- Letters C, R, A, K, L, T are not in the secret word (marked x).
- N and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared with a “-”.
  * N appeared in position 4 of CRANE and position 2 of KNELT, so N cannot be in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5.
  * E appeared in position 5 of CRANE and position 3 of KNELT, so E cannot be in positions 3 or 5. Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4.

We need a five‑letter English word that contains N and E in allowed spots and uses three other letters that haven’t been eliminated.  
Choosing N at position 1 and E at position 2 satisfies the constraints, leaving positions 3‑5 for new letters.

A suitable word is **NEIGH**:
- N is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- I, G, H are fresh letters not yet ruled out.
- No prohibited letters (C,R,A,K,L,T) appear.

This guess will confirm the exact spots for N and E and test three new letters.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- Eliminated letters (x): C, R, A, K, L, T, I, G, H.
- N and E are in the word but not in any positions they have appeared:
  * N cannot be positions 1,2,4 → possible positions: 3 or 5.
  * E cannot be positions 2,3,5 → possible positions: 1 or 4.

Thus the word must contain N and E in the allowed spots. One viable pattern is N at position 3 and E at position 4, giving the template **_ _ N E _**.

Looking for a common 5‑letter English word matching this pattern that uses only letters not yet ruled out, we find **BONES** (B O N E S):
- N is at position 3 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (allowed).
- B, O, S are fresh letters not previously eliminated.

This guess will test the exact positions of N and E and introduce three new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

We have determined the secret word's confirmed letters:
- O is correct at position 1 (from OXMEN).
- E is correct at position 4.
- N is correct at position 5.
- L is known to be in the word but not at position 4 (from KNELT), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
All other letters tried (C,R,A,K,T,I,G,H,B,S,X,M) are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is O _ _ E N, with L occupying either the 2nd or 3rd slot.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **OLDEN** (O L D E N), placing L at position 2 and introducing a new candidate letter D at position 3.

This guess will confirm the placement of L and test the new letter D while keeping the known correct letters fixed.

- E is correct at position 4.
- N is correct at position 5.
- L is known to be in the word but not at position 4 (from KNELT), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
All other letters tried (C,R,A,K,T,I,G,H,B,S,X,M) are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is O _ _ E N, with L occupying either the 2nd or 3rd slot.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **OLDEN** (O L D E N), placing L at position 2 and introducing a new candidate letter D at position 3.

This guess will confirm the placement of L and test the new letter D while keeping the known correct letters fixed.",Guess 6: OLDEN -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) L(✓) D(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
