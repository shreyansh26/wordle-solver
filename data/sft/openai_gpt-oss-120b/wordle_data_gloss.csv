### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, E, I, H, T, P, U, and also the letters from earlier guesses that were marked x.
- Confirmed letters:
  * L is correct at position 2 (from PLUGS → L(✓)).
  * S is correct at position 5 (from PLUGS → S(✓)).
  * G is in the word but not at position 4 (from PLUGS → G(-)). It also cannot be at position 3 (from LIGHT where G was marked - at position 3), so G must be at position 1 or 2, but position 2 is L, so G must be at position 1.
- The pattern of the secret word is therefore: G L _ _ S.

We need a valid English word matching G L _ _ S with the remaining letters not on the excluded list. “GLOBS” (G L O B S) satisfies all constraints:
- G is at position 1 (not position 4 or 3).
- L is at position 2 (correct).
- S is at position 5 (correct).
- O and B are unused letters that are not excluded.

Thus “GLOBS” is a consistent next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
