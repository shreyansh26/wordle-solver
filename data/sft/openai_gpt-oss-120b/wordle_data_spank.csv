2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from previous feedback:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- Letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all (x).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern __ A N __, using only letters other than C, R, E. A common word matching this pattern is **PLANK** (P L A N K). It respects all known constraints.
