### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Feedback from first guess CRANE:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters R and N, placed somewhere other than those positions. All other letters (C, A, E) are excluded. Choose a common word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and does not put R in slot 2 or N in slot 4.

Word ""RUNTS"" fits:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3), satisfying the positional constraints.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (U, T, S are still possible).
- Is a valid 5‑letter English word.

- From guess 2 (RUNTS): U, T, S are not in the word. R is present but not in position 1. N is present but not in position 3.

Thus the only confirmed letters are **R** and **N**. Their prohibited positions are:

Allowed positions:

The word **BORON** satisfies all conditions:
- B, O, R, O, N use none of the excluded letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- Both required letters are present, and no prohibited letters appear.

- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters R and N, placed somewhere other than those positions. All other letters (C, A, E) are excluded. Choose a common word that includes R and N, avoids C, A, E, and does not put R in slot 2 or N in slot 4.

Word ""RUNTS"" fits:
- Contains R (position 1) and N (position 3), satisfying the positional constraints.
- Uses only letters not ruled out (U, T, S are still possible).
- Is a valid 5‑letter English word.

So the next guess is ""RUNTS"".

We need a valid English 5‑letter word containing both R and N, using only letters not ruled out (C, A, E, U, T, S are excluded).  

The word **BORON** satisfies all conditions:
- B, O, R, O, N use none of the excluded letters.

- Both required letters are present, and no prohibited letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess should be **BORON**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
