### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have the following info from feedback:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5 = E).
- Letters **S, L, A, T, P, R, D** are not in the word at all.
- Letter **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (it was guessed in position 3 of PRIDE and got a “-”).

Thus we need a new guess that:
1. Ends with **E**.
2. Contains **I** in a different position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Avoids the forbidden letters S, L, A, T, P, R, D.

A good candidate is **NICHE**:
- Ends with E.
- Places I in position 2.
- Uses only new letters N, C, H (all not yet ruled out).

This will test I’s correct placement and give information about N, C, H.
