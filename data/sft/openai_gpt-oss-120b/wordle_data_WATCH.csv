### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is frequently used because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently appearing consonants (C, R, N). This should give useful feedback for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The feedback from the first guess tells us:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes C and A in different spots, avoids R, N, and E, and introduces other letters to gather more information.  
The word **PACTS** satisfies these conditions:
- A is in position 2 (different from the original position 3).
- C is in position 3 (different from the original position 1).
- It contains no R, N, or E.
- It adds the new letters P, T, and S for further clues.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PACTS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) C(-) T(-) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C is in the word but not in position 1; A is in the word but not in position 3; R, N, E are not in the word.
- From guess 2 (PACTS): P is not in the word; A is correct in position 2; C is in the word but not in position 3; T is in the word but not in position 4; S is not in the word.

Thus:
- Position 2 is fixed as **A**.
- C must be somewhere other than positions 1 or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- T must be somewhere other than position 4 → possible positions 1, 3, or 5.
- The remaining letters must avoid the excluded set {R, N, E, P, S}.

A viable English word that satisfies all constraints is **LATCH**:
- L A T C H
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- C appears at position 4 (not 1 or 3) (✓).
- T appears at position 3 (not 4) (✓).
- L and H are new letters and are not in the excluded set.

Therefore, the next guess should be “LATCH”.

- The first letter is still unknown but cannot be any of the letters that received an “x”: R, N, E, P, S, L, and also cannot be C (since C is already placed at position 4).  

Possible English words fitting the pattern _ A T C H are:
- BATCH
- MATCH
- WATCH
- HATCH (would repeat H)

All of these satisfy the known constraints. I will guess **BATCH** as a likely candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)
