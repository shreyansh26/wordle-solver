### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback, only the letter N is correct and is in the correct fourth position. All other letters (C, R, A, E) are not in the secret word at all.  
I need a new 5‑letter word with N as the fourth letter and none of the eliminated letters. “STING” fits: S‑T‑I‑N‑G, with N in position 4 and introduces only new letters.

From previous feedback:
- N is correct at position 4.
- I is correct at position 3.
- G is correct at position 5.
- T is in the word but not at position 2, so it must be at position 1.
Thus the word pattern is **T _ I N G**.  
We need a common word fitting that pattern. “THING” satisfies it, using a new letter H (not ruled out yet).
