### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All letters from the previous guess SLATE are confirmed not to be in the secret word (S, L, A, T, E). I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters. Choosing a common word with entirely different letters will give useful new information. ""CRONY"" uses C, R, O, N, Y, none of which appear in the rejected list, so it is a valid next guess.

We have feedback:
- From SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
- From CRONY: R is correct in position 2, C is in the word but not in position 1, O, N, Y are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ R _ _ _. It must contain C in one of positions 3‑5 (but not position 1). None of the eliminated letters may appear.

A viable word that satisfies these constraints is **BRICK**:
- Position 2 is R (matches).
- Contains C in position 4 (so C is present and not in position 1).
- Uses letters B, I, K which have not been eliminated.
- No banned letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be ""BRICK"".
