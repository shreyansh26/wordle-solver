### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the Wordle-like game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information for the next steps.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the next guess must contain the letter N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5) and must avoid C, R, A, E. I’ll choose a common word that fits: **BONDS** (N is third, and none of the forbidden letters appear).

From previous feedback:
- B is correct at position 1.
- Letters O, N, S are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ""BONDS"".
  - O cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in positions 3 (from BONDS) nor 4 (from CRANE), so N can be 2 or 5.
  - S cannot be in position 5.
- Letters C, R, A, E, D are not in the word.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses new letters for the unknown spots is **BISON**:
- B is fixed at position 1.
- I is a new letter (allowed).
- S is placed at position 3 (allowed, not position 5).
- O is placed at position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- N is placed at position 5 (allowed, not positions 2,3,4).

Thus BISON matches all known information and introduces a new letter to test.
