### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give useful information about the secret word. ""SLATE"" is a good starter because it covers two frequent consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E).

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain S, A, T, or E. It DOES contain the letter L, but L is NOT in the second position (the position it occupied in “SLATE”). Therefore L must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Our next guess should:
- Include L, placed somewhere other than the second slot.
- Avoid using S, A, T, E entirely.
- Introduce new letters to test other possibilities.

A good candidate is **WORLD**:
- It contains L in the fourth position (acceptable).
- It introduces the new letters W, O, R, and D, none of which have been ruled out yet.
- It does not contain any of the eliminated letters (S, A, T, E).

Thus “WORLD” satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh information for the next round.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position1 W is correct.
- Position2 O is correct.
- Position3 is unknown, cannot be R (since R was marked x) and cannot be any letters previously marked x: S, A, T, E, R.
- Position4 L is correct.
- Position5 D is correct.

Thus the secret word is W O _ L D. The only common English word fitting that pattern is ""WOULD"", with U in the third position. U hasn't been ruled out, so it's a valid guess.
