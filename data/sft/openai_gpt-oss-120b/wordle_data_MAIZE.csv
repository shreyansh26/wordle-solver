### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know:
- Letter E is correct at position 5.
- Letter A is in the word but not at position 3.
- Letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

We need a new guess that:
- Keeps E in the 5th spot.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3 (positions 1, 2, or 4).
- Uses fresh letters to test more possibilities, avoiding C, R, N.

A good candidate is **ALIVE**:
- A is at position 1 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters L, I, V.
- Ends with E as required.
- Doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters C, R, N.

Thus we will guess ""ALIVE"".

We have confirmed:
- Position 3 = I (✓ from ALIVE)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from both guesses)
- Letter A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from both “-” feedbacks), so A must be in position 2 or 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, V (all marked x).

A common 5‑letter word fitting these constraints is **MAIZE**:
- Pattern M A I Z E → A is at position 2, I at 3, E at 5.
- Uses only new letters (M, Z) that haven’t been ruled out.

Thus the next logical guess is MAIZE.
