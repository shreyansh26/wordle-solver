### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes a vowel (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This will give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word has A in the third position, and the letters C, R, N, and E are not present anywhere. Therefore, the next guess must be a valid five‑letter word with A as the third letter and must avoid using C, R, N, or E. 

A good candidate is **BLAST**:
- Pattern _ _ A _ _ (A in the correct third spot)
- Uses new letters B, L, S, T to test additional possibilities.
- Contains none of the excluded letters C, R, N, E.

This guess will give us more information about which of B, L, S, T are in the secret word and their positions.

We know:
- A is correct at position 3.
- B, C, E, N, R are not in the word.
- L, S, T are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in BLAST:
  * L cannot be position 2.
  * S cannot be position 4.
  * T cannot be position 5.
We need a five‑letter word with A third, containing L, S, T in the remaining slots, respecting those restrictions.  
“STALK” fits:
- Pattern: S (pos1), T (pos2), A (pos3), L (pos4), K (pos5)
- L is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, T is not in position 5.
- All letters are allowed, and K is a new test letter.

Thus “STALK” is a good next guess.
