### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

  * N is NOT in positions 4 or 5.
Therefore R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5; N can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:

The word **RINDS** satisfies all conditions:

  * R is NOT in positions 2 or 4.
  * N is NOT in positions 4 or 5.
Therefore R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5; N can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains both R and N,
- Places them in allowed spots,
- Uses none of the excluded letters (C, A, E, T, H, O).

The word **RINDS** satisfies all conditions:
- R is at position 1 (allowed),
- N is at position 3 (allowed),
- Remaining letters I, D, S are not excluded.

Thus it is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- C, A, E are not in the word.

- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains R and N, avoids C, A, E, and places R and N in different spots than those ruled out.

Word “THORN” fits:
- Contains R (position 4, not position 2) and N (position 5, not position 4).
- Uses only letters T, H, O, R, N – none of which are excluded.
Thus it is a valid next guess.

- The letters R and N are in the word, but:

Therefore R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5; N can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:

We have the following confirmed information:
- N is correct in position 2 (from UNRIG).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, so it must be in position 5.
- I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, so it can be in position 1 or 3.
- All letters marked “x” are not in the word: A, C, D, E, G, H, O, S, T, U.
- Therefore the word pattern is **_ N _ _ R**, with I in either the first or third slot.

A common English word that fits the known pattern, even though it contains a letter we have previously marked absent (E), is **INFER** (I N F E R). It respects the fixed positions of N (2) and R (5) and places I in a permissible spot (position 1). This guess will give us further information about the remaining letters.
