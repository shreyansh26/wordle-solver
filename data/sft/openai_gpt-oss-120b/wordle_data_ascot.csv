### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common, high‑frequency 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. This will give me useful information about which letters are present and their positions. Words such as “CRANE”, “SLATE”, or “AUDIO” are popular opening guesses. I’ll choose **CRANE** because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently used consonants (C, R, N), giving a balanced spread for the first feedback.

From the first feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain the letters C and A, placed somewhere other than those positions, and must avoid R, N, E. I’ll choose a word that includes C and A in new spots and introduces other possible letters to test. “MACHO” fits:
- C is in position 3 (allowed).

- No prohibited letters (R, N, E) are present.
Thus it’s a valid next guess.

- If A is at position 1, O must be at position 4 → pattern **A _ C O _**.

A common English word that matches the second pattern and uses only allowed letters is **ASCOT** (A‑S‑C‑O‑T).
