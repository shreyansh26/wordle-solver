### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, balanced word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to get broad information about the secret word. “SLATE” includes the vowel A and the common letters S, L, T, and E, which should give useful feedback for the next guesses.

We know from the first guess (SLATE) that:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains A (not in position 3) and avoids the letters S, L, T, E. “FAIRY” fits: it includes A in the second slot, and its other letters (F, I, R, Y) are not any of the excluded letters.

From previous feedback:
- Letters S, L, T, E, F, I are not in the word.
- A is in the word at position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word at position 4 (✓).
- Y is in the word at position 5 (✓).

Thus the secret pattern is: _ A _ R Y.

Possible words fitting this pattern and not using excluded letters include BARRY, CARRY, HARRY, MARRY, PARRY, etc. To test the first letter and whether the third letter is also R, I’ll guess **PARRY**.
