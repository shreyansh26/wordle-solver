### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback from CRANE: C and E are not in the word. R, A, and N are in the word but not in their original positions (R not second, A not third, N not fourth). We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, N, avoids C and E, and places these letters in different slots. ""MANOR"" fits: it contains A (2nd), N (3rd), R (5th) – all different from their original spots – and introduces new letters M and O, none of which are excluded. It's a valid English word.

We have determined fixed letters: position 3 = N (✓), position 5 = R (✓).  
From feedback, A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so A can be 1 or 4.  
O is in the word but not in position 4, so O can be 1 or 2.  

A word fitting the pattern _ _ N _ R with A at position 4 and O at position 2 is **SONAR** (S O N A R).  
It respects all previous clues and uses only letters not ruled out (C, E, M are excluded).  

Thus the next guess should be SONAR.
