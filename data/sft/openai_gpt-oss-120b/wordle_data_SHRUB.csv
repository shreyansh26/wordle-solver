### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know R is in the word but not in position 2. Letters C, A, N, E are not in the word. Choose a new word containing R in a different position and avoiding the excluded letters. ""ROUTS"" fits: R at position 1, and uses O, U, T, S which are all still possible.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: C, A, N, E are not in the word. R is present but not in position 2.
- From ROUTS: O, T are not in the word. R is present but not in position 1. U is present but not in position 3. S is present but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters R, U, and S. Their positions cannot be:
- R: not in positions 1 or 2.
- U: not in position 3.
- S: not in position 5.

All other letters used so far (C, A, N, E, O, T) are excluded.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word that includes R, U, S with those position constraints and uses only allowed letters for the remaining two spots. “SHRUB” fits:
- S at position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- H at position 2 (allowed)
- R at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2)
- U at position 4 (allowed, not 3)
- B at position 5 (allowed, S is not at 5)

All letters are permissible, so “SHRUB” is a good next guess.
