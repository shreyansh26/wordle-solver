### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has R in position 2 and A in position 3. Letters C, N, and E are not present anywhere. So the pattern is _ R A _ _. I’ll choose a word that fits this pattern and introduces new letters to learn more. “TRAMP” matches the pattern (T R A M P) and uses none of the excluded letters.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- Position 3 = A (✓)
- Position 5 = L (✓)

Excluded letters (not in the secret word): C, N, E, T, M, P, F, I, plus any letters shown as x in previous guesses.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ R A _ L.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word fitting that pattern without using excluded letters. “DRAWL” (D R A W L) matches the pattern and introduces two new letters (D, W) that have not been ruled out yet.

Hence the next guess is:
