### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE was completely wrong, so none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely and includes other common letters to get more information. A good candidate is “SPOIL”, which uses S, P, O, I, L – all letters not yet ruled out.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, P, O, I are not in the secret word.
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word using S and L in new positions and three other letters not among the excluded set.  
""FLUSH"" fits:
- Contains S (position 4) and L (position 2), both not in their banned spots.
- Uses new letters F, U, H, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it’s a valid next guess.
