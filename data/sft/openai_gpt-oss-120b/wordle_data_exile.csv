### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending in **E**, containing **L** in position 3 or 4, and using only letters we haven’t excluded.

We have confirmed that the secret word ends with **L E** (L in position 4, E in position 5).  
All letters marked X so far are not in the word: S, A, T, O, D, G, C, H, Y, R, U, B.  
Thus the remaining possible letters for positions 1‑3 are: F, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

We need a common 5‑letter English word of the form ___LE using only these letters.  
The word **NIPLE** (N I P L E) fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and is a valid term (a small pipe fitting).  

Therefore, the next guess will be “NIPLE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the feedback:
- The fifth letter is E (✓).
- L is in the word but not in the second position (‑), so L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- S, A, and T are not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in E, containing L in a position other than 2, and avoiding S, A, T.  
“LODGE” fits: it ends with E, has L in position 1, and uses only new letters (O, D, G) that haven’t been ruled out.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the feedback:
- The last letter is definitely **E**.
- **L** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters ruled out are **S, A, T, O, D, G**.

We need a new 5‑letter word ending in **E**, containing **L** in position 3 or 4, and using only letters we haven’t excluded.  

Choosing **L** in position 4 gives the pattern ***L E*. A common word that fits is **CHYLE** (C H Y L E). It uses new letters C, H, Y, avoids all excluded letters, and tests L in the 4th spot.

Thus the next guess is **CHYLE**.
