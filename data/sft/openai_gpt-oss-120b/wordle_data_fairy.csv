### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have determined from the last feedback that positions 2-5 are fixed: A (2), I (3), R (4), Y (5). Position 1 is unknown but cannot be any previously ruled-out letters (S, L, T, E, C, G, O, B, D, H). The only common English word fitting the pattern _ A I R Y is ""FAIRY"", with F as the first letter, which hasn't been eliminated. This guess should resolve the game.
