### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, N, and E are not in the word.
- A is correct in position 3.

So the secret word has A as the third letter, includes C somewhere other than the first position, and does not contain R, N, or E.

I need a new guess that keeps A in the third spot, places C in a different position (preferably position 2, 4, or 5), and introduces new letters to test. “SCAMP” fits these criteria (S C A M P), with C at position 2 and A at position 3, and uses letters we haven’t tested yet.

We have determined the confirmed positions:

- Position 2: C (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 5: P (✓)

Only position 4 is unknown. The word must be of the form S C A _ P. The letter R is ruled out (from Guess 1), and M is ruled out (from Guess 2). A valid English word that fits is **SCALP** (with L in the fourth slot). No letters used conflict with earlier feedback, so this is a logical next guess.
