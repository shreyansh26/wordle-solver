### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that uses a mix of common vowels and consonants to get good information. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess because it contains two common vowels (A, E) and three frequently occurring consonants. It will help identify any of those letters in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the feedback that the secret word starts with C and ends with E. The letters R, A, and N are not in the word at all. Therefore, for positions 2‑4 we need new letters that are not R, A, or N. A common word fitting the pattern C _ _ _ E is **CLOSE**, which uses L, O, and S—none of which have been ruled out.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C is correct at position 1, E is correct at position 5, and R, A, N are not in the word.
- From CLOSE: C is correct at position 1, L is not in the word, O is in the word but in the wrong position (so not position 3), S is correct at position 4, and E is correct at position 5.

Thus we know:
- Position 1 = C
- Position 4 = S
- Position 5 = E
- O is in the word but not at position 3 → the only remaining open positions are 2 and 3, and since position 2 is still empty, O must be at position 2.

The pattern is now **C O _ S E**.  
The only letters ruled out so far are R, A, N, L. We need a valid English word fitting C O _ S E. “COPSE” (a small group of trees) fits perfectly, placing P at position 3.

So the next guess is:
