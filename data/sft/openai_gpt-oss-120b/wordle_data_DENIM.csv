### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must contain at least one E somewhere in positions 1‑4. All other letters from the first guess are excluded.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains an E (not at the last position).
2. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoid S, L, A, T).
3. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **CHEER**:
- It has E in positions 3 and 4 (both not the last spot).
- It introduces the letters C, H, and R, which we have no information about yet.
- It does not contain any of the excluded letters S, L, A, T.

Thus we will guess CHEER.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letter E, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (based on both guesses). Therefore E must be in position 1 or position 2.

- Uses only letters that have not been excluded.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains an E (not at the last position).
2. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoid S, L, A, T).
3. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **CHEER**:
- It has E in positions 3 and 4 (both not the last spot).
- It introduces the letters C, H, and R, which we have no information about yet.
- It does not contain any of the excluded letters S, L, A, T.

Thus we will guess CHEER.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined that the secret word contains the letter E, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (based on both guesses). Therefore E must be in position 1 or position 2.

All letters S, L, A, T, C, H, and R have been ruled out.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Places E in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been excluded.
- Introduces fresh letters for more information.

A suitable candidate is **BEGUN** (B E G U N), which has E in position 2 and only uses letters not yet eliminated.

- From guess 3 (BEGUN): B, G, U are not in the word; E is correct at position 2; N is in the word but not at position 5 (feedback “-” on N).

So far we know:
- The secret word is of the form **_ E _ _ _**.
- It must contain an **N** somewhere other than the last position (positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Excluded letters: A, B, C, G, H, L, R, S, T, U.
- All other letters are still possible.

A common 5‑letter word satisfying these constraints is **PENNY**:
- Pattern fits: P E N N Y.
- Contains N (positions 3 and 4, not position 5).
- Uses only letters not excluded (P, E, N, Y).

Thus “PENNY” is a strong next guess.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:

- Position 2 is E (confirmed from BEGUN).
- Position 3 is N (confirmed from PENNY).
- N is not in position 5.
- Position 4 is not N.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, G, U, P, Y.
- Remaining possible letters for the unknown positions are: D, F, I, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (and also any not yet tested).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ E N _ _.

Common words that match this pattern and use only permissible letters include:

- DENIM (D E N I M)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
