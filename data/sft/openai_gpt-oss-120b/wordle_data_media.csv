### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:

- Position 2 is E (✓ from guess 4).
- Position 5 is A (✓ from guess 4).
- Letter M is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (both got “-”), and cannot be at position 2 (E) or 5 (A). Position 1 is the only remaining slot, so M must be at position 1.
- Therefore the pattern is **M E _ _ A**.

We need a valid English word fitting M E _ _ A using letters not ruled out (S,L,T,R,V,N,H,D,Y are excluded). The word **MECCA** (M E C C A) satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter C that hasn't been tested yet.

Thus the next guess should be MECCA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have confirmed:

- Position 2 = E (✓ from YEMMA)
- Position 5 = A (✓ from YEMMA and MECCA)

Positions 3 and 4 are not C (both C’s in MECCA were marked x) and are not M (YEMMA gave – for M at those spots). They also cannot be any letters that have been marked x earlier: S, L, T, R, V, N, H, D, Y, C.

Thus the pattern is **M E _ _ A** with the two middle letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Z). 

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **MEKKA** (a variant spelling of Mecca). It places K in both remaining slots, satisfying all constraints.

So the next guess should be “MEKKA”.
