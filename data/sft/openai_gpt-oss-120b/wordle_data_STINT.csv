### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed that positions 3,4,5 are I, N, T respectively. The excluded letters are C, R, A, E, G, L, J, O, and also any letters that got an x in those positions.

We have determined that positions 3,4,5 are I, N, T respectively from consistent feedback. The first two letters cannot be any of the letters that have been marked x in any position: C, R, A, E, G, L, J, O, Q, U. We need a common 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern __INT with new letters.

Possible candidates include:
- SKINT (S K I N T) – both S and K are not excluded and “skint” is a valid British slang word meaning broke.
- Other words like “flint” are invalid because L is excluded; “print” is invalid because R is excluded; “point” has O which is excluded.

Thus “SKINT” is a viable guess that adheres to all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have determined the following from feedback:

- Position 1 is S (from SKINT, where S was marked ✓).
- Positions 3, 4, 5 are I, N, T respectively (confirmed by GLINT, JOINT, QUINT, SKINT).
- Position 2 cannot be any of the letters that received an x in any guess: C, R, A, E, G, L, J, O, Q, U, K. It also cannot be S, I, N, or T unless the word contains a repeated letter.
- The remaining possible letters for position 2 are the other alphabet letters. The most common English word fitting the pattern S _ I N T is **STINT**, where the second letter is T (a letter not ruled out and allowed to repeat).

Thus the next guess should be “STINT”.
