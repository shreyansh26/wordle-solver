### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, H, O, T, L, M, B.
- Confirmed present letters: U and P.
- U is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from SHOUT and PLUMB). So U can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (from PLUMB). So P can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5‑letter word using U and P, with the remaining three letters drawn from the unused alphabet (D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and respecting the position constraints.

The word **GUPPY** fits:
- Contains U (position 2, allowed) and P (positions 3 and 4, both allowed).
- Uses only letters G, U, P, P, Y, none of which have been ruled out.
- Is a standard English word.

Thus GUPPY is a good next guess.
