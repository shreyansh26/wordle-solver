### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous feedback that the fourth letter is C (C is correct and in the correct position). All letters S, L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K are not in the word. So the secret word has pattern ___C_ with C fixed at position 4 and must avoid the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:

1. SLATE → all letters x → none of S, L, A, T, E are in the word.
2. BRICK → B, R, I, K are x; C is ✓ at position 4.
3. POUCH → P x, O ✓ (pos 2), U x, C ✓ (pos 4), H ✓ (pos 5).
4. MOOCH → M x, O ✓ (pos 2), O - (pos 3), C ✓ (pos 4), H ✓ (pos 5).

Thus we know the secret word has pattern **_ O _ C H** with O in the second spot, C in the fourth, H in the fifth. All letters seen as x are excluded: S, L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K, P, U, M.

We need a five‑letter word fitting _ O _ C H using only allowed letters. Viable candidates include “HOOCH” (H O O C H) and “GOOCH”, both use only allowed letters and satisfy the known positions. Guessing “HOOCH” will test the first letter (H) and also confirm whether a second O appears in the word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We need a word that uses new letters to gather more information. “POUCH” fits the pattern (P O U C H) with C at the fourth position and introduces the letters P, O, U, and H, none of which have been ruled out yet. This will help identify which of these letters belong in the secret word and their positions.

We need a 5‑letter word that fits the pattern _ O _ C H and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “MOOCH” (M O O C H) fits: 
- It respects the fixed O‑C‑H positions.
- Introduces only M (new) and repeats O (which is already known to be correct in position 2; a second O would be marked x if the secret has only one O, giving useful info).

Thus the next logical guess is **MOOCH**.

From the feedback on guesses:

- O at position 3 was also “-”, meaning there is an O elsewhere (we already have O at position 2). This again does not require a second O.
