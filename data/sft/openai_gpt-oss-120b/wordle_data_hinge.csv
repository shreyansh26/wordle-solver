### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “SLATE” is a good starter: it contains the vowel A and common consonants S, L, T, and E. This should give a clear picture of which letters are present and their positions.

The first guess gave us that the only correct letter is E in the fifth position, and the letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.  
So the secret word ends with **E** and contains none of those four letters. I’ll choose a new word that also ends with E and uses different letters to test more possibilities. “CHORE” fits: C, H, O, R are all new, and it ends with E.

We know:
- The word ends with E (position 5 correct).
- Letters S, L, A, T, C, O, R are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 2 (from CHORE feedback).

We need a 5‑letter word ending with E, containing H (not at position 2), and using only allowed letters (B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H and E).  

“HINGE” fits perfectly:
- Ends with E.
- Contains H at position 1 (allowed), and I, N, G are all allowed letters.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Thus “HINGE” is a valid next guess.
