We have deduced the following from the feedback:
- Position 1 = A (from ADAGE feedback)
- Position 3 = A (consistent across all guesses)
- Position 5 = E (consistent across all guesses)
- Eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N, Q, U, K, D, G, plus any letters that received an “x” in prior guesses.
Thus the secret word fits the pattern A _ A _ E, using only letters not yet ruled out. A common word that matches this pattern is **AMAZE** (A‑M‑A‑Z‑E), where M and Z have not been eliminated.

So the next guess should be AMAZE.
