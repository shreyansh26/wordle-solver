### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, N, E are not in the word (x). A is in the word but not in position 3 (‑).
- Guess 2 (BASIL): B, S, L are not in the word (x). A is correct in position 2 (✓). I is correct in position 4 (✓).
- Guess 3 (PATIO): P, T, O are not in the word (x). A and I remain correct in their positions.
- Guess 4 (MAFIA): M is correct in position 1 (✓). A is correct in position 2 (✓). F is not in the word (x). I is correct in position 4 (✓). The second A is in the word but not in position 5 (‑).

Thus the known pattern is:

1 M (green)  
2 A (green)  
3 ? (unknown, cannot be any of the excluded letters)  
4 I (green)  
5 ? (unknown, also cannot be any excluded letters; cannot be A because the A‑feedback at position 5 was “‑”, meaning the secret’s A is elsewhere)

Excluded letters (from all x feedback): B, C, E, F, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

Allowed remaining letters for positions 3 and 5 are: D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and A, but A can’t be at 5).

A common English word that fits the pattern **M A _ I _** using only allowed letters is **MAXIM** (M‑A‑X‑I‑M). Both X and the repeated M are permissible.

Therefore, the next guess should be “MAXIM”.
