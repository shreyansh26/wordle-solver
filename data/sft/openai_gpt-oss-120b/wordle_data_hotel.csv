### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that C, R, A, N are not in the word. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Our next guess should:

We have the following feedback so far:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From BLEED: B and D are not in the word. L is in the word but NOT in position 2. The first E (position 3) is in the word but NOT in that position. The second E (position 4) is correct, so the secret word has **E at position 4**.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E _.  
We must place L somewhere other than position 2, and we already have an E at position 4 (there could be another E elsewhere, that’s allowed). No letters C, R, A, N, B, D can appear.

A common word that satisfies these constraints is **LEVEL**:
- L is at positions 1 and 5 (not position 2), satisfying the “L present but wrong position” clue.
- E is at positions 2 and 4, giving the required E at position 4.
- V has not been ruled out yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be LEVEL.

- Include E in a different position (not 5th) to test its correct slot.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good choice is **BLEED**:
- Contains E at positions 3 and 4 (both not 5th).
- Uses new letters B, L, D which we haven’t tested yet.
- Contains no excluded letters.

Thus we’ll guess BLEED.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BLEED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback so far:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From BLEED: B and D are not in the word. L is in the word but NOT in position 2. The first E (position 3) is in the word but NOT in that position. The second E (position 4) is correct, so the secret word has **E at position 4**.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E _.  
We must place L somewhere other than position 2, and we already have an E at position 4 (there could be another E elsewhere, that’s allowed). No letters C, R, A, N, B, D can appear.

A common word that satisfies these constraints is **LEVEL**:
- L is at positions 1 and 5 (not position 2), satisfying the “L present but wrong position” clue.
- E is at positions 2 and 4, giving the required E at position 4.
- V has not been ruled out yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be LEVEL.

Guess 3: LEVEL -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) V(x) E(✓) L(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the following from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, D, V are not in the word.
- L is in the word and the correct position is the 5th letter (L at position 5). It is not at position 2.
- E is in the word and the correct position is the 4th letter (E at position 4). It is not at positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
- No other E or L appear elsewhere.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ _ E L, with the first three letters chosen from the remaining possible letters (e.g., P, I, X, etc.) and none of the excluded letters.

A common English word that matches this pattern and respects all constraints is **PIXEL**.

Therefore the next guess should be “PIXEL”.

We have determined from the feedback:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, B, D, V, P, I, X.
- The secret word ends with “EL”: position 4 = E (green), position 5 = L (green).
- L is not in position 1 or 2 (from earlier yellow on L), and E is not in positions 1‑3 or 5 (from earlier yellows).
- The remaining three letters (positions 1‑3) must be chosen from the unused alphabet, avoiding the eliminated letters.

A common English word fitting the pattern ???EL with all unknown letters still possible is **HOTEL** (H O T E L).
