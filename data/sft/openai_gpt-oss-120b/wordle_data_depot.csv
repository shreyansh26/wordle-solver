### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- From SWEET: S and W are not in the word. Both E's are in the word but in wrong positions (so E cannot be in positions 3 or 4). T in position 5 is correct.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following feedback:

- CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word (x). E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
- SWEET: S and W are not in the word (x). Both E’s are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (-). T in position 5 is correct (✓).
- PETIT: P and I are not in the word (x). E in position 2 is correct (✓). T in position 5 is correct (✓). T in position 3 is present but in the wrong place (-), confirming the only T belongs at position 5.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **_ E _ _ T**, with:
- No letters C, R, A, N, S, W, P, I.
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 (already satisfied by being at position 2).
- The only T is at position 5.

A common English word fitting these constraints is **BEGOT** (B E G O T):
- B, G, O are not among the excluded letters.
- Pattern matches _ E _ _ T.
- All prior feedback is satisfied.

Therefore the next guess should be “BEGOT”.

From the feedback we have determined the exact pattern of the secret word:
- Position 2 is E (confirmed by PETIT).
- Position 5 is T (confirmed by SWEET and PETIT).
- Position 4 is O (confirmed by BEGOT).
- The letter P is present somewhere other than position 1 (PETIT gave P(-)).
- No other letters from the excluded set (C,R,A,N,S,W,I,B,G) appear.

Thus the word must be of the form _ E _ O T and contain a P not in the first slot. The only common English word that fits all these constraints is **DEPOT** (D E P O T). This satisfies every piece of feedback we have received.

Therefore the next guess is DEPOT.
