### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

So the next guess must include A somewhere other than the third slot and must avoid C, R, N, E. I’ll pick a common word that satisfies these constraints: **GLOAT** (A is in the fourth position, and none of the forbidden letters appear).

From previous feedback:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, G, T.
- A is correct at position 4.

- O is in the word but not at position 3.

We need a 5‑letter word with A in the 4th slot, containing L and O elsewhere, and avoiding the forbidden letters.  
Word “LOYAL” fits: L (pos1), O (pos2), Y (pos3), A (pos4), L (pos5).  
- L is not in position 2, O is not in position 3, and no forbidden letters appear.
Thus “LOYAL” is a valid next guess.

2. **GLOAT** → G, T are not in the word; L and O are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (L not 2, O not 3); A is correct at position 4.  
3. **LOYAL** → O is correct at position 2; A is correct at position 4; L at position 5 is correct; the first L (position 1) is wrong, meaning L is not at position 1; Y is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 2 = **O**
- Position 4 = **A**
- Position 5 = **L**
- Position 1 ≠ L, C, R, N, E, G, T
- Position 3 is still unknown, but cannot be Y and cannot be the letters already ruled out.

Thus the pattern is: **_ O _ A L**.

A common English word that fits this pattern and respects all exclusions is **MODAL** (M O D A L).  
All its letters are allowed, and it satisfies the known positions.

Therefore the next guess will be “MODAL”.
