### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed positions:
- 2nd letter U (✓)
- 3rd letter D (✓)
- 4th letter G (✓)
- 5th letter E (✓)

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _UDGE. The first letter must be a letter not yet ruled out. Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, F, J, plus any others marked x. B has not been eliminated and forms a valid English word ""BUDGE"". Therefore the next logical guess is BUDGE.
