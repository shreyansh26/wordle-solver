### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common, vowel‑rich word to get information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” contains two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (C, R, N), making it a good first guess.

We know:
- Position 1 is C (✓).
- R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So we need a new 5‑letter word starting with C, containing N in a different position (2,3, or5), and avoiding R, A, E. “CONDO” fits: C at position 1, N at position 3, and uses only new letters O and D.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)

Eliminated letters: R, A, E, O, D (all marked x). N is not in position 4 (from first guess).

Thus the word pattern is C _ N _ _. Positions 2,4,5 must be letters not in the eliminated set and can include repeats of allowed letters.

A suitable common word fitting this pattern is **CYNIC**:
- C at position 1 (matches)
- Y at position 2 (new)
- N at position 3 (matches)
- I at position 4 (new, not N)
- C at position 5 (repeat of allowed letter)

All letters Y, I, and the repeated C have not been ruled out, so this guess will test them.
