### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

""CRANE"" is a frequent starter in these types of games because it includes the common letters C, R, N, and the vowels A and E, giving a good spread for initial feedback.

We know from the first guess that the fourth letter is N and that C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all. The next guess should keep N in the fourth position, and use new letters to test the remaining spots while avoiding the excluded letters. A good candidate is ""MOUND"" (M‑O‑U‑N‑D), which satisfies those constraints.
