### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 2 = O (✓ from both HOUSE and NOISE).
- Position 4 = S (✓ from HOUSE and NOISE).
- Position 5 = E (✓ from all guesses).

Excluded letters so far (marked x): L, A, T, H, U, N, I, G, and also the first O in GOOSE got a “-”, meaning O exists elsewhere (we already have it at position 2).  

Thus the word fits the pattern **_ O _ S E**.  
A common English word that matches this pattern and avoids all excluded letters is **POSSE** (P O S S E):
- P is not excluded.
- O is at the confirmed position 2.
- S at positions 3 and 4 satisfies the known S at position 4.
- E is at the confirmed position 5.

So POSSE is a logical next guess.
