### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 5 is **E** (green).
- Position 2 is **I** (green).
- The letter **I** also appears elsewhere (yellow at position 4 in the guess PIXIE), so the secret word contains at least two I's. The second I is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Excluded letters (gray): C, R, A, N, S, L, D, P, X, and also any letters that have shown as gray in other guesses.
- Allowed remaining letters include: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z (and of course I and E).

We need a 5‑letter word ending in **E**, with **I** fixed at position 2, and that introduces new letters while respecting the exclusions. A word that fits these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **GIGUE** (a term for a lively dance). It keeps I at position 2, ends with E, and adds the letters G and U for further testing.

Thus we will guess **GIGUE**.
