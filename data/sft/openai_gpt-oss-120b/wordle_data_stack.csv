### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A common strategy is to choose a word that contains frequently used letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter word because it includes the common letters C, R, A, N, and E.

From the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- C is in the word but not in position 2; it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters R, N, E, M, P are not in the word.

We need a word that keeps S at the first spot and A at the third, places C in a possible spot (4 or 5), and introduces new letters for the remaining positions while avoiding the excluded letters.

“SLACK” satisfies all constraints:
1 S (✓) – matches known S.
2 L – a new letter to test.
3 A (✓) – matches known A.
4 C (‑) – puts C in a permissible position (4).
5 K – another new letter to test.
