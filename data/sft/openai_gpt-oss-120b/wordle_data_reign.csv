### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N in different positions, and avoids C, A, E. 
A good candidate is “ROBIN”:

From the first guess (CRANE):
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”.

From the second guess (ROBIN):
- R is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- O and B are not in the word.

So far we have:
- Position 1 = R
- Position 5 = N
- I must be in position 2 or 3.
- E must be somewhere in positions 2‑4 (it cannot be position 5 because N is there).

We need a word R _ _ _ N containing I and E among the middle three letters.  
A common word that satisfies all constraints is **RIVEN** (R I V E N):
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- V is a new letter we haven’t tested yet.
- No excluded letters appear.

Thus the next logical guess is “RIVEN”.
