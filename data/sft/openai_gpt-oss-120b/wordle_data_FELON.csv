### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Exclude C, R, A.
- Include N and E, but place them in different slots than 4 and 5 respectively.
Choosing a word that also tests other common letters will give more information. “INDEX” fits: it contains N (2nd position) and E (4th position), both different from the prohibited slots, and adds I, D, X to test new letters while respecting the exclusions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: INDEX -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) D(x) E(-) X(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>From the first guess CRANE, we know C, R, and A are not in the secret word. N and E are present but not in the positions they occupied (N not in position 4, E not in position 5).

From the second guess INDEX, we learn that I, D, and X are not in the word. N is present but not in position 2, and E is present but not in position 4.

Combining these constraints:
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and also not in position 4 from the first guess, so N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, I, D, X.

We need a common 5‑letter word that includes N and E in allowed slots and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “LEMON” fits:
- Contains E in position 2 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed).
- Uses letters L, O, M, which have not been eliminated.

Thus “LEMON” is a valid next guess.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 2 = **E** (✓ from LEMON)
- Position 4 = **O** (✓ from LEMON)
- Position 5 = **N** (✓ from LEMON)

Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, A, I, D, X, L, M, plus the previously eliminated letters from earlier guesses (C, R, A, I, D, X).

Thus the secret word matches the pattern **_ E _ O N** and must use only letters that have not been ruled out.

A common English word that fits this pattern and respects all constraints is **TENON** (a woodworking term). It places the unknown letters **T** (position 1) and **N** (position 3) – both are still possible – while keeping the confirmed letters in their correct spots.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 4 = O (✓ from LEMON)
- Position 5 = N (✓ from LEMON)
- Letter L is in the word but not at position 1 (from L‑dash in LEMON), so L must be at position 3 (the only remaining slot).

Thus the pattern is **_ E L O N**.

The only common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not ruled out (C, R, A, I, D, X, M, T are all excluded) is **FELON**.
