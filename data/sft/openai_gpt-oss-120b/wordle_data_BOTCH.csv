### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I’ll start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter word because it uses C, R, A, N, and E, covering a frequently used vowel (A, E) and some common consonants.

We know from the previous feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. To gather more information, I’ll pick a word that includes C in a later position and introduces several new letters while avoiding the excluded ones. “MUSIC” places C at the end (position 5) and adds the letters M, U, S, I, all of which haven’t been ruled out yet. This should give us useful new clues.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in positions 1 or 5 (from previous feedback). All other letters tried so far (R, A, N, E, M, U, S, I) are not in the word. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4. We need a new guess that places C in one of those positions and introduces only letters that have not been ruled out.

The word “BLOCK” satisfies these conditions:
- C is in position 4 (allowed).
- The other letters B, L, O, K have not been tested and are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “BLOCK” is a good next guess.
