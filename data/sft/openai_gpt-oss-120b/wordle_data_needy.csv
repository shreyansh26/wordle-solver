### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

I need a new 5‑letter guess that includes N and E in different positions (avoiding their previous spots) and avoids C, R, A. A good candidate is **TENDS** (T‑E‑N‑D‑S), which places E at position 2 and N at position 3, satisfying the constraints.

We have:
- Position 2 is E (confirmed ✓).
- Position 4 is D (confirmed ✓).
- N is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4, and from earlier not at position 4, so N must be at position 1 or 5. 
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, T, S, plus any letter marked x in previous guesses.

We need a word fitting the pattern N E _ D _ (placing N at position 1) or _ E _ D N (placing N at position 5). A common word that fits the first pattern is **NEEDY** (N‑E‑E‑D‑Y). This uses known letters in the correct spots and introduces Y to test a new letter.

Thus we guess NEEDY.
