### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a common English word matching A??RE that does not use any eliminated letters. Good candidates include:

- **AZURE** (A‑Z‑U‑R‑E) – Z and U have not been tried and are not excluded.
- **AWARE** (A‑W‑A‑R‑E) – repeats A, which is possible but less certain.
- **AGREE** (A‑G‑R‑E‑E) – puts an extra E at position 4, but we already know R occupies position 4, so this doesn’t fit.
- **ALORE** (A‑L‑O‑R‑E) – contains O, which is eliminated.

Among these, **AZURE** fits the pattern perfectly and introduces two new letters (Z, U) while respecting all known constraints.
