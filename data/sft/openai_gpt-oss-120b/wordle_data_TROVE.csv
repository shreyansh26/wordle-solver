### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we have:

- R is correct in position 2.
- A is not in the word.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and cannot contain C, A, or N anywhere. I will choose a word that matches this pattern and introduces new letters. “TRITE” fits (_=T, R, I, T, E) and avoids the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)  
  → Positions: _ R _ _ E. Letters C, A, N are not in the word.

- Guess 2: TRITE → T(✓), R(✓), I(x), T(-), E(✓)  
  → Positions: T R _ _ E.  
  → I is not in the word. The second T is marked “-”, meaning the letter T appears in the secret word but not in that position (position 4). Since we already have a T confirmed at position 1, the second T could simply be the same T being flagged as present elsewhere; we therefore only need one T in the word. Position 4 therefore cannot be T.

Now we need a five‑letter word that fits the pattern **T R _ _ E**, avoids the letters C, A, N, I, and does not have a T in position 4.

A good candidate is **TROPE** (T R O P E). It matches all known constraints and introduces two new letters (O, P) for further information.

Thus the next guess is:
