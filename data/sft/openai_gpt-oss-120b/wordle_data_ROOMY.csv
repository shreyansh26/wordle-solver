### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E. The letter R is in the word but not in position 2 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore our next guess must include R in a different position and avoid the disallowed letters. Choosing a common word that satisfies these constraints helps gather more information. “SPORT” contains the required R in position 4, and none of the forbidden letters, making it a good next guess.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- **R** is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 → therefore **R must be at position 1**.
- **O** is correct at position 3 (✓ from both SPORT and FLOUR).

So the secret word fits the pattern: **R _ O _ _**.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching this pattern and avoiding all eliminated letters.  
A good candidate is **RHOBO**:

- R in position 1 (required).  
- O in position 3 (required).  
- Uses only allowed letters (H, B, O) for the remaining spots.

This guess will test the new letters H and B and also check whether a second O appears at the end.

We have accumulated feedback:
- Letters not in word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, F, L, U, H, B.
- R is correct at position 1 (from guess 4).
- O is correct at position 3 (from guesses 2, 3, 4).
- The O at position 5 received a “-”, meaning the letter O exists elsewhere besides position 5; therefore the secret word contains another O in a different position (not 5). Since O is already at position 3, the second O must be at position 2 or 4.
- Remaining unknown positions are 2, 4, 5, using letters not yet eliminated.

A common word satisfying these constraints is **ROOMY**:
- R at position 1 (✓).
- O at positions 2 and 3 (third O matches the confirmed O; second O explains the “-” feedback at position 5).
- M and Y are unused letters not yet ruled out.

Thus ""ROOMY"" is a logical next guess.
