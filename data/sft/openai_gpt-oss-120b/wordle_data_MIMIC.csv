### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the Wordle game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants, giving me good information about the secret word. “CRANE” is a popular opener that includes the vowel A and the common letters C, R, N, and E, which will help identify letters and positions early on.

The first guess gave feedback: C is in the word but in the wrong position, while R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. Therefore, the secret word must contain the letter C somewhere other than the first position, and must avoid the letters R, A, N, E. I’ll choose a new word that includes C in a later position and tests other common letters while respecting these constraints. “MUSIC” fits: it puts C at the fifth position and uses only letters (M, U, S, I) that haven’t been ruled out.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Position 1 is M (✓ from ""MUSIC"").
- Position 4 is I (✓ from ""MUSIC"").
- Position 5 is C (✓ from ""MUSIC"").
Letters R, A, N, E, U, S are ruled out.  
The remaining unknown letters are positions 2 and 3, which must be letters not yet excluded.  
A common English word fitting the pattern M _ _ I C is **MIMIC** (M I M I C). This uses only allowed letters and matches all known constraints.
