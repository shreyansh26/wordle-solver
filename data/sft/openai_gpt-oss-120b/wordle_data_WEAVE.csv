### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowel placements, to get useful information about the secret word. 
A good opening guess is **CRANE**, which includes the vowels A and E and the frequent consonants C, R, and N. This should give a solid baseline for the next steps.

We have confirmed:
- A is correct in position 3.

- Excluded letters (marked x): C, R, N, S, L, T, Q, U, K, I, M, G, and also from previous guesses we know they are not in the word.

We need a common English word that fits __A_E using only allowed letters. “WEAVE” fits perfectly:
- W (allowed) in position 1
- E (allowed, duplicate of the known E) in position 2
- A (✓) in position 3

- E (✓) in position 5

It introduces new letters W and V while respecting all constraints.
