### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have N confirmed at position 4.  
Letters C, R, A, E, B, L are not in the word.  
From the second guess (BLOND): O is in the word but not at position 3, D is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word must be of the form _ _ _ N _, contain O and D (with O ≠ 3, D ≠ 5), and avoid the excluded letters.  
A word that fits these constraints is **DONNY** (D 1, O 2, N 3, N 4, Y 5). It uses D and O in allowed spots, has N in the required 4th position, and contains no forbidden letters.

So the next guess will be “DONNY”.

The N guessed at position 3 received a “-”, meaning N is in the word but not at position 3. Since we already have N correctly placed at position 4, this simply confirms that the only N is at position 4, and the third letter must be something else.

Thus the secret word has the pattern **D O _ N Y**.  
We need a common five‑letter English word fitting this pattern and avoiding letters already ruled out (C, R, A, E, B, L).  

The word **DOWNY** (meaning “covered with down”) matches perfectly:
- D O W N Y → fits the pattern,
- W has not been used or excluded.

Therefore the next logical guess is “DOWNY”.
