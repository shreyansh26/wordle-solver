### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is C (correct).
- Position 4 is N (correct).
- Letters R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
Thus the pattern is C _ _ N _. We need a valid word that fits this pattern and avoids R, A, E.

A good candidate is **COINS**:
- C at position 1,
- N at position 4,
- Uses new letters O, I, S which haven’t been ruled out.
It satisfies all constraints.

We need a word C _ _ N _. Candidates must avoid excluded letters and have N at position 4. Good candidates include ""CHUNK"" (C H U N K) and ""CLUNG"" (C L U N G). Both introduce new letters not yet tested. I'll guess ""CLUNG"" to check L, U, G.
