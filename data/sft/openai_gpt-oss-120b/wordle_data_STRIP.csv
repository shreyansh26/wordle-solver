### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know:
- Position 1 is S (✓).
- L, A, and E are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word starts with S, contains a T somewhere other than the 4th slot, and contains none of L, A, E. I’ll pick a word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more information. “STORM” fits: S‑T‑O‑R‑M, with T in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1 = S (✓)
- Position 2 = T (✓)
- Letters not in the word: L, A, E, O, M
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (from STORM feedback). So R can be in position 3 or 5.

We need a guess that keeps S and T in the first two slots, places R in a possible spot (position 3 or 5), and introduces new letters to test. “STRIP” fits: S‑T‑R‑I‑P, putting R in position 3 (allowed) and adding I and P for new information.

Thus the next guess will be “STRIP”.
