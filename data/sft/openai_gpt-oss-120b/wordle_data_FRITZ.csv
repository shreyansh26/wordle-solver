### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word.

This should give a balanced initial clue about the secret word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ R I _ _. Since T isn’t at the 5th spot, it can be placed at position 1 or 4.

Trying T at position 1 gives “TRI??”, but common words like TRIED, TRITE, TRICK all contain excluded letters (E, C).  
Trying T at position 4 gives the pattern ? R I T ?. A valid English word that fits and uses only allowed letters is **FRITH** (an old word meaning “peace, safety”). It places T at position 4, satisfying the “‑” feedback for T, and introduces new letters F and H for further testing.

Thus the next guess should be FRITH.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: T (✓)
- Position 5: unknown; must not be any previously eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, P, O, W, L, G, S, H) and must be a valid English word.

The only common word fitting the pattern FRIT_ with a permissible fifth letter is **FRITZ** (a recognized English word referring to a sudden, sharp sound or a slang term; also appears in dictionaries). Z has not been ruled out yet.

Thus the next guess should be FRITZ.
