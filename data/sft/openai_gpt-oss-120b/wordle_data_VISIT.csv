### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need a new five‑letter word that avoids those letters and introduces fresh common letters. Choosing “LIGHT” gives me L, I, G, H, T – all of which haven’t been ruled out yet, and includes two vowels (I) and several high‑frequency consonants. This should provide useful new information.\n\n<guess>LIGHT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: LIGHT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We know from feedback:\n- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H are not in the word.\n- I is correct in position 2.\n- T is correct in position 5.\nThus the pattern is _ I _ _ T with the forbidden letters removed.\nWe need a common English word fitting that pattern and avoiding the excluded letters.\n""PIVOT"" fits: P I V O T, matches the pattern, and contains none of the forbidden letters.\n\n<guess>PIVOT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: LIGHT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(✓)\nGuess 3: PIVOT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) V(-) O(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have confirmed letters:\n- I is correct in position 2.\n- T is correct in position 5.\n- V is in the word but not in position 3 (from PIVOT feedback).\n\nThus the pattern is _ I _ _ T with V either at position\u202f1 or\u202f4.\n\nTo determine V’s exact spot, I’ll guess a word that places V at position\u202f1, keeps I at\u202f2 and T at\u202f5.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1: V (✓) – V is correct there.
- Position 2: I (✓) – I is correct there.
- Position 5: T (✓) – T is correct there.
- Position 3: V received “-”, meaning V is in the word but not at position 3. Since we already have V at position 1, the “-” could simply be indicating the presence of V elsewhere (the already‑found V). It does not force a second V.
- Position 4: E is marked “x”, so E is not in the word.

Thus the pattern so far is **V I _ _ T** with the remaining letters not being C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, P, O, or any already‑ruled‑out letters.

A common English word that fits this pattern is **VISIT** (V I S I T). It introduces the new letter S and tests whether a second I is present.

I will guess that word next.
