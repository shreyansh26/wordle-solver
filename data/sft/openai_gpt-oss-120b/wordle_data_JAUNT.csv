### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- S is not in the word.
- A at position 2 is correct (✓).
- U at position 3 is correct (✓).
- N at position 4 is correct (✓).
- The second A (position 5) is in the word but not at position 5 (‑).

Thus we now know the word pattern is **_ A U N _** with the first letter not being C, R, E, or S, and the last letter not being A. A common English word fitting this pattern is **TAUNT**.

This guess also introduces a new letter (T) to test further possibilities.

- From guess 3 (TAUNT): A, U, N, and T at position 5 are correct; the first T is present elsewhere (which we already have at position 5), so position 1 is not T.

Thus the word must be **_ A U N T**, with the first letter not being C, R, E, S, or T. The common English word that fits this pattern is **HAUNT**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct at position 4.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”).

Thus the secret word pattern is ___N_ with an A somewhere except position 3.  
Choosing a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters, “SAUNA” fits:
- N is at position 4.
- A appears at positions 2 and 5 (not position 3).
- No prohibited letters (C, R, E) are used.
This guess will test the remaining possibilities.
