### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need to start the game with any valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that covers a variety of common letters is “CRANE”. It contains two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two frequent vowels (A, E), giving us good information for the first feedback.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore the next guess should:
- Include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoid the letters C, R, A, E.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **BINGO**: it contains N at position 3, and adds the fresh letters B, I, G, O, none of which have been ruled out yet.
