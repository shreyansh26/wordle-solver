### Game Rules:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

The first letter must be C (✓) and the last letter must be E (✓).  
Letters R and A are in the secret word but cannot be in the positions they occupied in the first guess: R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.  
Letter N is not in the word at all.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form C _ _ _ E that contains R and A in different positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).  
A suitable word is **CARTE**: C‑A‑R‑T‑E, which satisfies all the constraints.
