### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or E. It does contain the letter N, but N is not in the fourth position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore the next guess must:
- Include N, but not at position 4.
- Exclude C, R, A, and E.
- Use other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **BISON**:
- Contains N at the 5th position (allowed).
- Uses letters B, I, S, O that have not been ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good candidate is **BISON**:

Choosing a word that fits the pattern _ I _ _ _ with N at position 1 or 3 and introduces fresh letters, “NIGHT” works:

We have the following feedback:

- CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word (x). N is present but in the wrong position (-), so N is not in position 4.
- BISON: B, S, O are not in the word (x). I is correct in position 2 (✓). N is present but still in the wrong position (-), so N is not in position 5.
- NIGHT: N is not in position 1 (-). I is still correct in position 2 (✓). G, H, T are not in the word (x).
- VINYL: V and L are not in the word (x). I is correct in position 2 (✓). N is correct in position 3 (✓). Y is present but in the wrong position (-), so Y cannot be in position 4.

From these we know:
- Position 2 = I
- Position 3 = N
- Y is in the word, but not at position 4; therefore Y must be at position 1 or 5.
- N cannot be at positions 1,4,5, so its confirmed spot is position 3.
- Excluded letters (x) are: C, R, A, E, B, S, O, G, H, T, V, L.
- Remaining usable letters include: D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A common 5‑letter English word that fits the pattern _ I N _ Y, uses only allowed letters, and places Y at the last position is **PINKY** (P I N K Y). This introduces new letters P and K while satisfying all known constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be “PINKY”.
