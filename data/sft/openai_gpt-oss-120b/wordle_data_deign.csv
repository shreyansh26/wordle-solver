### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells me:
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- N and E are in the word, but N is not in the 4th position and E is not in the 5th position.

I need a new word that:
- Contains N and E, placed away from those forbidden spots.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (no C, R, A).
- Introduces several new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **ENJOY**:
- E is at position 1 (allowed).
- N is at position 2 (allowed).
- J, O, Y are new letters to test.

This guess satisfies all constraints and will give useful new clues.

We know the secret word contains the letters N and E.

From the feedback:
- N is not in positions 2 or 4, so N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

All other letters tried (C, R, A, J, O, Y) are not in the word.

We need a new guess that includes N and E in allowed spots and introduces three fresh letters to gather more information.  
The word **MENDS** fits:
- M (new), E (position 2, allowed), N (position 3, allowed), D (new), S (new).
- No eliminated letters are used.
