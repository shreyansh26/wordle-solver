I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering both consonants and a vowel.

The feedback from the first guess tells us:
- C, A, and E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes both R and N, places R somewhere other than the second slot, and places N somewhere other than the fourth slot. It should also avoid C, A, and E.

The word **SHORN** satisfies all these conditions:
- Contains R (position 4) and N (position 5).
- R is not in position 2 and N is not in position 4.
- No prohibited letters (C, A, E) appear.

Thus, “SHORN” is a valid next guess.
