### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, A, and E are not in the word.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _.  
We must include N somewhere other than the 4th slot. A good candidate is the word **PRION** (P R I O N), which places N at the 5th position and avoids the forbidden letters C, A, and E.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 5 is N (correct).
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 4, so O must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters C, A, P, I, E are not in the word.
- N is already placed at 5, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

Trying O at position 1 gives patterns like O R _ _ N, but common English words fitting that (e.g., ORGAN) contain excluded letters. 

Trying O at position 3 gives the pattern _ R O _ N. A common word that fits is **BROWN**:
- B (new, not excluded)
- R (position 2, correct)
- O (position 3, allowed)
- W (new, not excluded, not position 4 restriction)
- N (position 5, correct)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first feedback:
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, A, and E are not in the word.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _.  
We must include N somewhere other than the 4th slot. A good candidate is the word **PRION** (P R I O N), which places N at the 5th position and avoids the forbidden letters C, A, and E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: PRION -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) O(-) N(✓)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Position 2 is R (correct).
- Position 5 is N (correct).
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 4, so O must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters C, A, P, I, E are not in the word.
- N is already placed at 5, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

Trying O at position 1 gives patterns like O R _ _ N, but common English words fitting that (e.g., ORGAN) contain excluded letters. 

Trying O at position 3 gives the pattern _ R O _ N. A common word that fits is **BROWN**:
- B (new, not excluded)
- R (position 2, correct)
- O (position 3, allowed)
- W (new, not excluded, not position 4 restriction)
- N (position 5, correct)

All constraints are satisfied, so BROWN is a strong candidate for the next guess.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ R O W N. The first letter cannot be B, C, P, I, A, or E (all previously ruled out). Viable English words are DROWN, FROWN, and GROWN. I'll guess DROWN to test the first letter.
