### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first guess CRANE we know:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the next guess must include A in a different slot (1,2,4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E. A balanced guess with common letters is “ALOUD” (A in position 1, and uses L, O, U, D which haven’t been ruled out).

We know from previous feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, L, D.
- Present letters: A (not in positions 1 or 3), O (correct at position 3), U (present but not in position 4).
Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ O _ _, must contain A and U in allowed spots:
A can be in positions 2,4,5.
U can be in positions 1,2,5 (but not 4).
A word satisfying these constraints and using only allowed letters is **QUOTA** (Q‑U‑O‑T‑A):
- O is correctly placed at position 3.
- U is at position 2 (allowed).
- A is at position 5 (allowed).
- No excluded letters appear.
So we guess QUOTA.
