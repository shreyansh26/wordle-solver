### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all, so we must avoid them in the next guess. I’ll choose a common word that includes C in a different position and uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out. “MUSIC” places C at the last position and uses only letters (M, U, S, I) that are still possible.

We have letters confirmed in the word: C, S, I.
- C is not in positions 1 or 5 (from CRANE and MUSIC). So C can be 2,3,4.
- S is not in position 3 (from MUSIC). So S can be 1,2,4,5.
- I is not in position 4 (from MUSIC). So I can be 1,2,3,5.

We need a valid 5‑letter word containing C, S, I that respects those position restrictions and avoids letters known to be absent (R, A, N, E, M, U). “SLICK” fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed),
- C in position 4 (allowed),
- I in position 3 (allowed),
- L and K are new letters not ruled out.

Thus “SLICK” is a good next guess.
