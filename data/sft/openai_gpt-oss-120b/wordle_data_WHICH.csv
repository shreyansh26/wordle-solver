### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have identified the secret word pattern based on feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y, Q, U, K are not in the word.
- C is in the word but not first; later confirmed C is correct at position 4.
- I is correct at position 3.

Thus the secret word looks like: _ _ I C _.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern, using only letters not eliminated. The word “WHICH” fits perfectly:
- Position 1: W (allowed)
- Position 2: H (allowed)
- Position 3: I (confirmed)
- Position 4: C (confirmed)
- Position 5: H (allowed)

All letters are permissible, and the word is a common five‑letter English word. Therefore the next guess should be “WHICH”.
