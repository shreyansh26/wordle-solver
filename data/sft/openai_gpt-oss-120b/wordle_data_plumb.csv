### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. I should choose a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters and includes other common letters to gather more information. “SHOUT” uses S, H, O, U, and T, all of which are allowed and gives a good mix of consonants and a vowel.

- U is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.
- B is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 3.
We need a 5‑letter English word containing U, B, and L respecting those position restrictions.  
The word **PLUMB** satisfies:
- Contains L (position 2) – not position 3.
- Contains U (position 3) – not positions 2 or 4.
- Contains B (position 5) – not position 1.
All other letters (P, M) are unused and not eliminated.
