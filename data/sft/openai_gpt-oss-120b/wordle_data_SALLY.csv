### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word. The letter A is present but not in the third position. The next guess should therefore avoid C, R, N, and E, and place A in a different slot (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Based on all feedback:
- Positions 2,3,5 are A, L, Y respectively (from BALMY and TALLY).
- TALLY gave L at position4 a ✓, confirming L there.
- FALSY indicated S is in the word but not at position4, so S must be at position1.
Thus the word is S A L L Y = ""SALLY"".
We should guess this word.
