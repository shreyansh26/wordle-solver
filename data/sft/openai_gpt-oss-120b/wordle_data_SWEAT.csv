### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 3 = E (✓ from PLEAD)
- Position 4 = A (✓ from PLEAD)

Letters excluded (not in the word): C, R, N, P, L, D, plus the letters from those positions that were marked x.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ E A _

We need a common 5‑letter word matching that pattern and using new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.  
Possible candidates: **SHEAF** (S H E A F) or **SWEAT** (S W E A T). Both avoid the excluded letters. I’ll guess “SWEAT” to test S, W, and T in the remaining slots.
