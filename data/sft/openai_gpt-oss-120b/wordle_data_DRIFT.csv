### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word has R in the second position and does not contain the letters C, A, N, or E anywhere. I need a new five‑letter word that respects these constraints. “TRUST” fits: it has R as the second letter and contains none of the excluded letters. This guess will test T, U, S as possible letters in the remaining slots.

Current constraints:
- Position 2 is R (green from all guesses).
- Position 5 is T (green from TRUST and ORBIT).
- Letter I is in the word but not in position 4 (yellow from ORBIT). Thus I can be in position 1 or 3.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, U, S, O, B.
- From TRUST we know T is not in position 1 (yellow), but it is already confirmed at position 5, so we avoid another T at position 1.

We need a word of the form _ R _ _ T, containing I in position 1 or 3, and using only allowed letters.  
Choosing I for position 3 gives the pattern _ R I _ T. A common English word that fits is **DRIFT** (D R I F T). It respects all constraints and introduces two new letters (D and F) for further testing.
