### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from previous guesses:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was “-” in LIGHT).

Therefore the next guess must:
1. Include L, but not at the first position.
2. Avoid all excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T).

We look for a common 5‑letter word satisfying those constraints and introducing new letters to gain information. “SLUMP” fits:
- Positions: S (1), L (2), U (3), M (4), P (5)
- L is not in position 1.
- None of the letters S, U, M, P are among the excluded set.

Thus “SLUMP” is a valid next guess.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

  * L is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2 (both gave “-”).
  * U is in the word but not at position 3 (gave “-”).

Thus the secret word pattern is:

L must be in one of positions 3‑5, and U must be in one of positions 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).

We need a common five‑letter word that:
- Starts with S,
- Contains L and U in allowed spots,
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

The word **SULKY** fits perfectly:

- U at position 2 (allowed),
- L at position 3 (allowed),
- K and Y are new letters, none of which are excluded.
