### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- A is correct at position 3.
- Letters S, L, T, E, G, N, D are not in the word.
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore the word pattern is _ _ A _ _. R must be at position 1, 4, or 5.  
A suitable common English word satisfying all constraints is **ROACH**:
- R is at position 1 (not position 2).
- A is at position 3.
- None of the forbidden letters appear.

We have these constraints:
- Position 3 is A (confirmed).
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, E, G, N, D, O, C.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback on GRAND and ROACH). So R can be position 4 or 5.
- H is in the word but not position 5 (from ROACH). So H can be position 1, 2, or 4.

We need a 5‑letter word matching pattern _ _ A _ _, containing R and H, respecting the position restrictions.

Try placing H in position 2 and R in position 4: pattern _ H A R _. A common English word fitting this is **WHARF** (W H A R F). It satisfies all constraints:
- No forbidden letters.
- H is not in position 5.
- R is not in position 1 or 2.
- A is correctly at position 3.

Thus WHARF is a valid next guess.
