# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, so it can be at 3 or 4.
- Letters C, N, T, H are not in the word.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and introduces new letters for more information is **MAKER**:
- Position 1 M (unknown, not forbidden)
- Position 2 A (confirmed)
- Position 3 K (unknown)
- Position 4 E (allowed)

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following constraints from feedback:
- A is confirmed at position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, so it can be at 3 or 4.
- Letters C, N, T, H are not in the word.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and introduces new letters for more information is **MAKER**:
- Position 1 M (unknown, not forbidden)
- Position 2 A (confirmed)
- Position 3 K (unknown)
- Position 4 E (allowed)
- Position 5 R (allowed)

Thus “MAKER” fits the known pattern and will give us further clues.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- C and N are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains R, A, and E.
- Places R somewhere other than the 2nd position, A somewhere other than the 3rd, and E somewhere other than the 5th.
- Does not contain C or N.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **EARTH**:
- E is in position 1 (not 5th).
- A is in position 2 (not 3rd).
- R is in position 3 (not 2nd).
- It also adds new letters T and H for more information.

- Letters proven not in the word: C, N, T, H, M, K, F, D, S, plus earlier excluded ones.
