### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C is correct and in the first position.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- A and N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word looks like: C _ _ _ _
It must contain R (not at position 2) and E (not at position 5), and cannot contain A or N.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **CURED**:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R in position 3 (allowed).
- Contains E in position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- Introduces new letters U and D for further testing.
Thus, CURED is a logical second guess.

We need a valid 5‑letter word matching that pattern, using letters not yet ruled out (A, N, U, D are excluded). A common candidate is **COVER** (C‑O‑V‑E‑R), which fits the pattern and introduces new letters O and V for further testing.
