### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that includes a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess in these games because it covers a good variety of frequent letters and includes the vowel “A”. I’ll use that as my initial attempt.

From the first guess ""CRANE"" we learned:
- C is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore the next guess must contain the letter C (but not in position 1) and avoid R, A, N, E. I’ll choose a word that places C in a different spot and introduces new common letters to test. “SCOUT” fits: it has C in the second position and introduces S, O, U, T, none of which have been ruled out.
