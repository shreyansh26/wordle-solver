### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these word‑guessing games because it includes the common vowel “A” and frequently used consonants “C”, “R”, “N”, and “E”. This should provide a good spread of letters for the first round of feedback.

We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C, R, A are NOT in the secret word.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Our next guess should:
1. Include N and E, placed in different positions than 4 and 5 respectively.
2. Avoid letters C, R, A.
3. Introduce new letters to test more possibilities.

The word “ENVOY” satisfies these:
- Contains E (position 1) and N (position 2), avoiding the prohibited spots.
- Uses only new letters V, O, Y besides E and N.
- No C, R, or A.

Thus “ENVOY” is a strong second guess.

<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>I need to start with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants, giving me useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions. “CRANE” is a popular opening guess in these word‑guessing games because it includes the common vowel “A” and frequently used consonants “C”, “R”, “N”, and “E”. This should provide a good spread of letters for the first round of feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We know from the first guess CRANE:
- C, R, A are NOT in the secret word.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Our next guess should:
1. Include N and E, placed in different positions than 4 and 5 respectively.
2. Avoid letters C, R, A.
3. Introduce new letters to test more possibilities.

The word “ENVOY” satisfies these:
- Contains E (position 1) and N (position 2), avoiding the prohibited spots.
- Uses only new letters V, O, Y besides E and N.
- No C, R, or A.

Thus “ENVOY” is a strong second guess.

Guess 2: ENVOY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) V(x) O(x) Y(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have established:
- Letters C, R, A, V, O, Y are not in the secret word.
- Letters E and N are in the secret word.
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback: ENVOY pos1 gave '-', CRANE pos5 gave '-')
- E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (ENVOY pos2 gave '-', CRANE pos4 gave '-')
- N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes E and N in allowed spots and introduces three new letters to test.  
A word fitting these constraints is **NEXUS**:
- N is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- The remaining letters X, U, S have not been tried yet.
Thus NEXUS is a valid guess.

Guess 3: NEXUS -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(✓) X(x) U(x) S(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have the following information:
- Letters C, R, A, V, O, Y, X, U, S are not in the secret word.
- E is confirmed at position 2 (E ✓).
- N is in the word but not in positions 1,2,4 (from previous guesses). So N must be at position 3 or 5.
- We need a new word that respects these constraints and introduces new letters.

A good candidate is **DENIM**:
- Pattern D E N I M fits: E is at position 2.
- N is at position 3, which is allowed.
- Letters D, I, M have not been tried yet and are not excluded.

Thus this guess will test three fresh letters while obeying all known constraints.

We have determined the confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 2 = E (confirmed by two ✓)
- Position 4 = I (✓ from DENIM)
- Position 5 = N (the only remaining possible spot for N after it was ruled out elsewhere)

Thus the secret word pattern is _ E _ I N.

All letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, V, O, Y, X, U, S, D, M, plus the already‑used E, I, N. Remaining viable letters for the unknown slots are any of the unused alphabet letters.

A common English word fitting the pattern _ E _ I N is **BEGIN** (B‑E‑G‑I‑N). Both B and G have not been eliminated, so this guess tests new letters while matching all known constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be BEGIN.
