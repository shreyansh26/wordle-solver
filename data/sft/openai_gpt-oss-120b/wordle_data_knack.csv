### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word with:
- A fixed at the third position.
- Both C and N present, with C not at position 1 and N not at position 4.
- No R or E anywhere.

The word “SNACK” satisfies all conditions:
- Pattern: S N A C K
- A is at position 3.
- C appears at position 4 (not position 1).
- N appears at position 2 (not position 4).
- Contains no R or E.

Thus, “SNACK” is a valid next guess.

From the previous feedback:
- Guess 2 (SNACK) gave: S(x) N(✓) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓)
So positions 2‑5 are fixed as N A C K.
The only unknown is the first letter, which cannot be S (x), R, E (from guess 1), nor any letter already proven not to belong.
A common English word matching the pattern _ N A C K is **KNACK** (K at position 1, N‑A‑C‑K follow). This also satisfies all earlier clues (C is not in position 1, N is not in position 4, etc.).
Therefore the next logical guess is “KNACK”.
