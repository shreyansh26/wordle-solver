### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have feedback:
- From CRANE: all letters C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From MIGHT: I is correct (✓) in the second position, all other letters M,G,H,T are not in the word.

Therefore the secret word has pattern: _ I _ _ _. None of the letters C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,T can appear elsewhere.

We need a new guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to gather more information. Choosing a common word with I in the second slot and letters not yet excluded is optimal. 

Word candidates like “LIVID”, “VIVID”, “SILOS”, etc., fit, but “SILKY” gives four fresh letters (S, L, K, Y) while keeping I in the correct spot. None of those letters have been ruled out, so “SILKY” is a strong next guess.

- Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown, but cannot be any letters that received an “x” in any prior guess.

Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, T, S, K.

Thus the secret word is of the form _ I L _ Y, using only letters not in the excluded list. Viable common English words fitting this pattern include:

- DILLY

- JILLY
- PILLY
- WILLY

Choosing a word that introduces a new letter in position 1 and also tests whether L appears a second time (by placing L in position 4) will give the most information. “FILLY” does exactly that: it tests F at the first position and repeats L at the fourth position.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have determined the pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = I (✓)
- Position 3 = L (✓)
- Position 5 = Y (✓)
- Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown, but cannot be any letters that received an “x” in any prior guess.

Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, T, S, K.

Thus the secret word is of the form _ I L _ Y, using only letters not in the excluded list. Viable common English words fitting this pattern include:
- BILLY
- DILLY
- FILLY
- JILLY
- PILLY
- WILLY

Choosing a word that introduces a new letter in position 1 and also tests whether L appears a second time (by placing L in position 4) will give the most information. “FILLY” does exactly that: it tests F at the first position and repeats L at the fourth position.

Therefore the next guess should be **FILLY**.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 2: I (✓ from multiple guesses)
- Position 3: L (✓)
- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
- Position 1 is still unknown.

Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, T, S, K, F.

Possible letters for position 1 are those not excluded and not already used as known letters (I, L, Y). Common English words fitting the pattern ? I L L Y include:

- BILLY
- DILLY
- FILLY (ruled out because F is not in the word)
- JILLY (unlikely)
- PILLY (unlikely)
- WILLY (W not excluded)

Choosing a word that tests a new first letter while keeping the confirmed pattern gives the most information. ""BILLY"" introduces B, a plausible first letter, and matches the known positions.

Thus the next guess should be **BILLY**.
