2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We know from the feedback:
- C and R are not in the word.
- N is correct at position 4.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with N in the fourth spot, containing A and E elsewhere, and avoiding C and R.  
The word “AMEND” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: A (pos1), M (pos2), E (pos3), N (pos4), D (pos5)
- N is at position 4 as required.
- A is present (pos1, not position 3).
- E is present (pos3, not position 5).
- No C or R appear.

Thus “AMEND” is a valid next guess.
