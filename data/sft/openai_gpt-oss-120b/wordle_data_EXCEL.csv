### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain C and E (in different positions from the first guess) and four other letters that are not R, A, N. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **PECKS**:
- C is in position 3 (not position 1).
- E is in position 2 (not position 5).
- None of the letters are R, A, or N.
This guess will test new letters P, K, S while keeping C and E in new spots.

From the feedback:
- C is confirmed at position 3.
- E is in the word but not at positions 2 or 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4.
- The letters R, A, N, P, K, S are not in the word.

We need a five‑letter word with C third, containing E at position 4 (since position 1 would conflict with many common words), and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. “VICED” fits:
- V I C E D → C is third, E is fourth.
- None of V, I, D are among the excluded letters.
Thus this guess will test new letters while respecting all known constraints.
