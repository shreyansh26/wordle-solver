### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 2: GRASP -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) S(x) P(x)
Guess 3: TRAIL -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>We have confirmed that the secret word has R in position 2 and A in position 3. All other letters guessed so far are not in the word: C, N, E, G, S, P, T, I, L. So the pattern is _ R A _ _. The remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out are B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

We need a common English word fitting the pattern with letters from this pool. “BRAVO” (B R A V O) satisfies the pattern, uses only letters not eliminated, and is a valid word. This will test three new letters (B, V, O).

Thus the next guess is:

<guess>BRAVO</guess><|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

We know the secret word pattern is _ R A _ _. Eliminated letters: C, N, E, G, S, P, T, I, L, B, V, O. Remaining possible letters for the unknown slots are D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and repeats of allowed letters). A good common word fitting the pattern and using only unused letters is **FRAUD** (F R A U D). This introduces three new letters (F, U, D) and follows the known positions.
