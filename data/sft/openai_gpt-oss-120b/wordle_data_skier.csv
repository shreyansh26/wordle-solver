### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter guess that:
1. Includes both R and E.
2. Places R somewhere other than the 2nd slot and E somewhere other than the 5th slot.
3. Avoids the letters C, A, N.

A good candidate is **SLIER**:
- Contains R (at position 5) and E (at position 4), satisfying the position constraints.
- Uses only new letters S, L, I besides R and E, none of which have been ruled out.
- “SLIER” is a valid English word.

So we will guess SLIER.

From feedback:
- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: L is not in the word, so the second letter is unknown but cannot be L, C, A, N.
- Position 3: I is correct.
- Position 4: E is correct.
- Position 5: R is correct.

Thus the word pattern is **S _ I E R**. A common English word fitting this pattern is **SKIER** (K is a permissible new letter). I will guess that.
