### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes a frequently used vowel (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This will give useful feedback for the next steps.

We have the following feedback:

- A is confirmed at position 4 (A✓ in BLEAT).
- L is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 (L‑ in BLEAT, L‑ in PALED). So L can be at position 1 or 5.
- E is in the word, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (E‑ in BLEAT, E‑ in PALED, E‑ in CRANE). So E can be at position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, P, D, B, T.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ A _.  
Possible placements:
- If L is at position 1, then E must be at position 2 → pattern **L E ? A ?**.
- If L is at position 5, then E can be at position 1 or 2 → patterns **E ? ? A L** or **? E ? A L**.

A word that fits the second case and introduces new letters is **EQUAL** (E = 1, Q = 2, U = 3, A = 4, L = 5). All its letters are allowed, and it will test the positions of L and E while adding the new letters Q and U.

- A is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (but could be 1, 4, or 5).
- L is NOT in position 3 (could be 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- E is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (could be 1, 2, or 3).

All letters marked x are ruled out: C, R, N, P, D, plus any other letters we haven’t tested yet.

A 5‑letter word that fits these constraints and introduces new letters is **BLEAT**:
- B (new)
- L in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- T (new)

This guess will tell us the exact positions of A, L, and E and test two new letters.

- A is confirmed at position 4 (A✓ in BLEAT).
- L is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 (L‑ in BLEAT, L‑ in PALED). So L can be at position 1 or 5.
- E is in the word, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (E‑ in BLEAT, E‑ in PALED, E‑ in CRANE). So E can be at position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, P, D, B, T.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ A _.  
Possible placements:
- If L is at position 1, then E must be at position 2 → pattern **L E ? A ?**.
- If L is at position 5, then E can be at position 1 or 2 → patterns **E ? ? A L** or **? E ? A L**.

A word that fits the second case and introduces new letters is **EQUAL** (E = 1, Q = 2, U = 3, A = 4, L = 5). All its letters are allowed, and it will test the positions of L and E while adding the new letters Q and U.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Position 4 = A (from BLEAT and confirmed by later guesses).
- Position 5 = L (confirmed by EQUAL and LEGAL).

The pattern is: _ E _ A L.

Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere) are: C, R, N, P, D, B, T, Q, U, G, and also L is not allowed in position 1 (from LEGAL).  

So the first and third letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (F, H, I, J, K, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.) and form a valid English word.

A suitable word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **HEXAL** (H E X A L). It introduces new letters H and X, respects all constraints, and will tell us if either of those letters is correct.
