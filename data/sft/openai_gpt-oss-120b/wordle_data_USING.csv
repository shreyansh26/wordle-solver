# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the only correct letter so far is N, and it is in the fourth position (CRANE → positions 1‑5, N is fourth). The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all, so we must avoid them in future guesses. We need a new 5‑letter word with N as the fourth character and no C, R, A, or E. A good candidate is **GLINT** (G‑L‑I‑N‑T), which satisfies those constraints.

Thus the pattern is:

S must be present but cannot be at position 1, and positions 3‑5 are already fixed (I N G). Therefore S must occupy position 2. The remaining first letter must be a letter not yet ruled out (cannot be C, R, A, E, L, T, W, etc.).
