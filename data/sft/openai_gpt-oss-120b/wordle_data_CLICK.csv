### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)

Letters ruled out (x): R, A, N, E, O, U, T, M, B, F.

So the secret word pattern is C L I _ _. We need two remaining letters that are not any of the eliminated ones. Viable letters: D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly C again).

A common English word fitting C L I _ _ and using allowed letters is **CLICK** (C L I C K). It keeps the known letters and introduces C (which isn’t eliminated) and K (still possible) in the last two positions.
