# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:

- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 4: E (correct)

Letters known NOT in the word: C, A, N, B, I, F, P, O, M, U, L.

We need a word of the form G R _ E _. Position 3 cannot be U and must be a letter not yet eliminated. Position 5 cannot be L and must also be a new letter.

A common word fitting the pattern is **GREET** (G‑R‑E‑E‑T). It introduces only the new letter T (not previously ruled out) and repeats E in a new position, which is allowed if the secret has two Es. This will test whether the third position is also an E and give us the final letter.
