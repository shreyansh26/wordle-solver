### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess that the secret word has R in the second position, and does not contain the letters C, A, N, or E anywhere. To maximize information, I’ll choose another common word that places R correctly and introduces new letters while avoiding the disallowed ones. “FRUIT” fits: it has R in the second slot and uses four new letters (F, U, I, T) none of which have been ruled out.

We know:
- R is correct at position 2.
- Letters C, A, N, E, F, U, I are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not at position 5, so T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Choose a word that:
- Has R in the second slot.
- Includes T in one of the allowed positions (1, 3, or 4) and not at 5.
- Avoids all letters already ruled out.
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

The word **TROOP** satisfies these conditions:
- T is at position 1 (allowed).
- R is at position 2 (correct).
- Contains new letters O and P, none of which have been ruled out.
- No banned letters appear.

Thus, “TROOP” is a logical next guess.

From previous feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 2.
- O is confirmed in position 3 (first O got ✓, second O got - meaning only one O and it's at position 3).
- T is in the word but not at position 5 (from FRUIT) and not at position 1 (from TROOP). The only remaining spot for T is position 4, so T is likely at position 4.
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N, E, F, U, I, P, and the second O at position 4.

Thus the word pattern is: _ R O T _. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only new letters is **BROTH**.
