### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Thus the secret word must contain an A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and none of the letters C, R, N, E.

Choose a new guess that includes A in a different position and avoids the excluded letters while testing new letters. “BALMY” fits:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters B, L, M, Y which have not been tested yet.
- Contains no prohibited letters.

So the next guess will be BALMY.
