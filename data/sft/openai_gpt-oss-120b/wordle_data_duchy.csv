### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined from previous feedback that the secret word has:
- U in position 2 (✓ from MUCUS)
- C in position 3 (✓ from MUCUS)

Letters ruled out so far: R, A, N, E, S, T, I, K, O, M, plus any letters shown as x.

We need a word of the form _ U C _ _. Choosing a common word that fits and introduces new letters will give more information. “DUCHY” (D U C H Y) meets the pattern, uses only letters not yet excluded, and lets us test D, H, and Y.

Therefore the next guess should be DUCHY.
