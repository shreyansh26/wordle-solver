### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the pattern from previous guesses:

- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: T was marked “-”, meaning T is in the word but not in position 2. The only remaining open spots are 2,4. Since position 3 is A and 5 is E, T must be position 4.
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Position 4: K was marked “-”, meaning K is in the word but not in position 4. The only open spot left besides the fixed letters is position 2, so K belongs there.
- Position 5: E (✓)

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **S K A T E**, which is a valid English word and matches all feedback.

The next guess should therefore be the correct word **SKATE**.
