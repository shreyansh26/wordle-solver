First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used. We want to include a mix of vowels and consonants.

I recall that ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), and these letters are all fairly common in English words.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one, with S, L, A, T, E.

But let me think about the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter and position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

For the first guess, I need to pick a valid 5-letter English word. I should avoid words with repeated letters to cover more ground.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a solid choice. It has no repeated letters.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Now, I need to output it in the specified format.

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used. We want to include a mix of vowels and consonants.

I recall that ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), and these letters are all fairly common in English words.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one, with S, L, A, T, E.

But let me think about the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter and position
- - : letter in word but wrong position

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position).
- Does not contain C, R, A.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we have to (but we know C, R, A are out).

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to think of words that end with E and have an N somewhere (but not at position 4). Also, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We know the word has an N and an E. The E is fixed at the end.

Possible positions for N: it cannot be at position 4, but it could be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions.

Some examples:
- INANE: I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, we must avoid A. So not this.
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, has N at position 2, and no A, C, R. Also, we haven't tried U, I, T.

But we don't know if the word has U, I, T. This seems like a good candidate.

Another example: ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N at position 4? But we know N is not at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for CRANE said N was in the word but not at position 4. So in the new word, we can put N at position 1, 2, or 3. In SPINE, N is at position 4? Let me check: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we are not supposed to put N at position 4 because the feedback said N is not in the correct position at 4. So we must avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, in the new word, we should put N at position 1, 2, or 3.

In SPINE, N is at position 4, so that's not allowed. We need a word with N at 1, 2, or 3 and E at 5.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 1: 
- NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> ends with E, N at 1, and no A, C, R. This seems good.

But we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. We can try this.

Another word with N at position 2: 
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> N at 2, and no A, C, R.

Or with N at position 3:
- ANIME: but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- OUNCE: O, U, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

So let's consider:
- NOISE: N at 1, and letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at 5, so that's fixed. We are testing O, I, S at positions 2, 3, and 4? But note: in NOISE, the positions are:
  - N (position 1)
  - O (position 2)
  - I (position 3)
  - S (position 4)
  - E (position 5)

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. In NOISE, N is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, we are testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has N at position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.

But note: we also have the constraint that the word does not contain A, C, R.

Another candidate: ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). Here N is at position 2, which is allowed. We test U, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We need to find the other three letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

In NOISE, we are testing O, I, S. In UNITE, we are testing U, I, T.

Both are good. But note that we have two known letters (N and E) and we are trying three new letters.

We could also consider a word that has the N in a different position, such as position 2 or 3, to see if it fits.

But let me check: are there words with N at position 2 and 5 letters? Like ""INANE"" but that has A (not allowed) and also we don't know about I and N? But we can't use A.

Another word: ""ONISE"" is not a word. ""UNISE"" is not common. ""UNITE"" is common.

What about ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T, E -> ends with E, N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we must avoid putting N at position 4? No, the feedback only said that in CRANE, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. But in the secret word, N might be at position 4? No, because the feedback for CRANE said N is in the word but not at position 4. That means the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4 because we know it's not there. So ""POINT"" has N at position 4, which we should avoid.

So we need a word with N at 1,2, or 3.

Let me list some words:
- N at 1: NOISE, NOBLE, NOOSE, NURSE, etc. (must end with E, so N _ _ _ E)
- N at 2: UNITE, ONSET, INLET, etc. (U _ N _ E, or _ N _ _ E)
- N at 3: _ _ N _ E (like POINT but avoid N at 4? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if we put N at 3, then the next position is 4, so we can put a letter at 4 and E at 5. But we know N is not at position 4, but we are not putting N at 4 in this guess? Actually, we can put any letter at 4 as long as we don't put N there? But note: we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. However, we should avoid putting N at position 4 in this guess because we already know that position 4 is not N. So to save a letter, we can put a non-N at position 4.

But in the example, the secret word had only one N? We don't know if it has more. So we can assume one N for now.

So for position 3: 
- We have words like ""MINCE"" (invalid due to C) -> avoid C.
- ""PINNE"": not common, and has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""PINNE"" is not standard.

Better: ""BUNCE"": B, U, N, C, E -> has C (not allowed) and also we avoid C? No, we cannot use C.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> N at position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> again, N at 4, which we should avoid.

So position 3 is tricky? Let me think of words with N at position 3 and ending with E: 
- ""AXONE"": but A is not allowed and X is not common.
- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4? P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> again position 4.

Actually, it's hard to find a word with N at position 3 and E at 5? Because the fourth position is often N? But we need N at 3? Let me clarify: the word must have the letter N at the third position? But in English words, it's common for words to have the Nth letter as a consonant and then the E at the end? But the E is at the fifth, so the fourth can be any letter.

So words like: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at position 4 -> avoid.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

Actually, ""URINE"" has R, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

So let's focus on words without A, C, R.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""ALINE"": but A is not allowed.
- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E -> no A, C, R. And N is not in this word? But we know the word must have an N. So we must include N.

So we need a word that has N at position 1, 2, or 3 and ends with E.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 2: 
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 1: 
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the end. So: 
  - ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that doesn't work.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with N at position 3 and ending with E? Because in English, words with N at position 3 and then E at the end are rare? For example, ""AXINE"" is not common. 

But let's consider: the secret word has E at position 5 and N somewhere (not at position 4). So the word might be like ""UNITE"", ""NOISE"", or ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E.

Another word: ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but that's 5 letters? I-N-L-E-T? No, that's 5: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5? But we have E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the fifth letter. So the fourth letter can be anything, and fifth is E.

So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I found: ""ANODE"": but A is not allowed.

""AGONE"": A not allowed.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E at position 1 and 5? And we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""EXILE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not supposed to use E at position 1? We can use it, but we know that if the secret word has E at position 1, we'll get a check. But we don't know. Also, we are testing X, I, L.

But we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""EXILE"" is acceptable? But it has two E's? That might be okay.

But let me check: ""EXILE"" is a valid word.

But we have to consider: we know E is at position 5, so if we use E at position 1, we might get feedback on that.

But we are trying to get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E in the first position to avoid confusion? But we don't know.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5. So we have E at 2 and N at 5. But we need E at 5, so that's fine. But we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2. Also, we are testing B, G, I.

But ""BEGIN"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""BEGIN"" is acceptable.

Now, let's compare:

Option 1: NOISE -> tests N at position 1, and O, I, S at positions 2,3,4.
Option 2: UNITE -> tests U, I, T at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 2.
Option 3: BEGIN -> tests B, G, I at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 5 (which is allowed, since we only know N is not at position 4).

We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We are going to get feedback on the positions of N and E (we already know E is at 5, so we'll get a check for E). For N, we'll get feedback: if it's at the correct position, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if it's in the word but wrong position) or an x (if not in the word).

But we also want to test new letters.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it tests three new letters (O, I, S) at positions 2,3,4 and we know N is at 1. Also, if the secret word has O, I, S, we'll get feedback.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" tests U, I, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters. We might get more information.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But let me check: is ""NOISE"" a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (A, C, R). ""NOISE"" has N, O, I, S, E. No A, C, R. Good.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

Now, I need to output it in the required format.

But first, let me think: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then ""UNITE"" would be a good choice because it has N at position 2.

But we don't know. So we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has E and N. We don't know about other vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""NOISE"", we have O and I (vowels) and S (common consonant). In ""UNITE"", we have U and I (vowels) and T (common consonant).

Both are good.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" for now.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include N (since it's in the word) but not at position 4.
- Include E at position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""NOISE"" because:
- It places N at position 1 (a position we haven't tested for N) to see if N belongs there.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4) at positions 2,3,4.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, C, R) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help identify if any of O, I, S are in the word and their positions.

<guess>NOISE</guess>",NOISE,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position).
- Does not contain C, R, A.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we have to (but we know C, R, A are out).

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to think of words that end with E and have an N somewhere (but not at position 4). Also, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We know the word has an N and an E. The E is fixed at the end.

Possible positions for N: it cannot be at position 4, but it could be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions.

Some examples:
- INANE: I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, we must avoid A. So not this.
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, has N at position 2, and no A, C, R. Also, we haven't tried U, I, T.

But we don't know if the word has U, I, T. This seems like a good candidate.

Another example: ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N at position 4? But we know N is not at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for CRANE said N was in the word but not at position 4. So in the new word, we can put N at position 1, 2, or 3. In SPINE, N is at position 4? Let me check: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we are not supposed to put N at position 4 because the feedback said N is not in the correct position at 4. So we must avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, in the new word, we should put N at position 1, 2, or 3.

In SPINE, N is at position 4, so that's not allowed. We need a word with N at 1, 2, or 3 and E at 5.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 1: 
- NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> ends with E, N at 1, and no A, C, R. This seems good.

But we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. We can try this.

Another word with N at position 2: 
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> N at 2, and no A, C, R.

Or with N at position 3:
- ANIME: but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- OUNCE: O, U, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

So let's consider:
- NOISE: N at 1, and letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at 5, so that's fixed. We are testing O, I, S at positions 2, 3, and 4? But note: in NOISE, the positions are:
  - N (position 1)
  - O (position 2)
  - I (position 3)
  - S (position 4)
  - E (position 5)

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. In NOISE, N is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, we are testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has N at position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.

But note: we also have the constraint that the word does not contain A, C, R.

Another candidate: ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). Here N is at position 2, which is allowed. We test U, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We need to find the other three letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

In NOISE, we are testing O, I, S. In UNITE, we are testing U, I, T.

Both are good. But note that we have two known letters (N and E) and we are trying three new letters.

We could also consider a word that has the N in a different position, such as position 2 or 3, to see if it fits.

But let me check: are there words with N at position 2 and 5 letters? Like ""INANE"" but that has A (not allowed) and also we don't know about I and N? But we can't use A.

Another word: ""ONISE"" is not a word. ""UNISE"" is not common. ""UNITE"" is common.

What about ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T, E -> ends with E, N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we must avoid putting N at position 4? No, the feedback only said that in CRANE, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. But in the secret word, N might be at position 4? No, because the feedback for CRANE said N is in the word but not at position 4. That means the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4 because we know it's not there. So ""POINT"" has N at position 4, which we should avoid.

So we need a word with N at 1,2, or 3.

Let me list some words:
- N at 1: NOISE, NOBLE, NOOSE, NURSE, etc. (must end with E, so N _ _ _ E)
- N at 2: UNITE, ONSET, INLET, etc. (U _ N _ E, or _ N _ _ E)
- N at 3: _ _ N _ E (like POINT but avoid N at 4? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if we put N at 3, then the next position is 4, so we can put a letter at 4 and E at 5. But we know N is not at position 4, but we are not putting N at 4 in this guess? Actually, we can put any letter at 4 as long as we don't put N there? But note: we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. However, we should avoid putting N at position 4 in this guess because we already know that position 4 is not N. So to save a letter, we can put a non-N at position 4.

But in the example, the secret word had only one N? We don't know if it has more. So we can assume one N for now.

So for position 3: 
- We have words like ""MINCE"" (invalid due to C) -> avoid C.
- ""PINNE"": not common, and has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""PINNE"" is not standard.

Better: ""BUNCE"": B, U, N, C, E -> has C (not allowed) and also we avoid C? No, we cannot use C.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> N at position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> again, N at 4, which we should avoid.

So position 3 is tricky? Let me think of words with N at position 3 and ending with E: 
- ""AXONE"": but A is not allowed and X is not common.
- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4? P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> again position 4.

Actually, it's hard to find a word with N at position 3 and E at 5? Because the fourth position is often N? But we need N at 3? Let me clarify: the word must have the letter N at the third position? But in English words, it's common for words to have the Nth letter as a consonant and then the E at the end? But the E is at the fifth, so the fourth can be any letter.

So words like: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at position 4 -> avoid.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

Actually, ""URINE"" has R, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

So let's focus on words without A, C, R.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""ALINE"": but A is not allowed.
- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E -> no A, C, R. And N is not in this word? But we know the word must have an N. So we must include N.

So we need a word that has N at position 1, 2, or 3 and ends with E.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 2: 
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 1: 
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the end. So: 
  - ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that doesn't work.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with N at position 3 and ending with E? Because in English, words with N at position 3 and then E at the end are rare? For example, ""AXINE"" is not common. 

But let's consider: the secret word has E at position 5 and N somewhere (not at position 4). So the word might be like ""UNITE"", ""NOISE"", or ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E.

Another word: ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but that's 5 letters? I-N-L-E-T? No, that's 5: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5? But we have E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the fifth letter. So the fourth letter can be anything, and fifth is E.

So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I found: ""ANODE"": but A is not allowed.

""AGONE"": A not allowed.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E at position 1 and 5? And we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""EXILE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not supposed to use E at position 1? We can use it, but we know that if the secret word has E at position 1, we'll get a check. But we don't know. Also, we are testing X, I, L.

But we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""EXILE"" is acceptable? But it has two E's? That might be okay.

But let me check: ""EXILE"" is a valid word.

But we have to consider: we know E is at position 5, so if we use E at position 1, we might get feedback on that.

But we are trying to get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E in the first position to avoid confusion? But we don't know.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5. So we have E at 2 and N at 5. But we need E at 5, so that's fine. But we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2. Also, we are testing B, G, I.

But ""BEGIN"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""BEGIN"" is acceptable.

Now, let's compare:

Option 1: NOISE -> tests N at position 1, and O, I, S at positions 2,3,4.
Option 2: UNITE -> tests U, I, T at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 2.
Option 3: BEGIN -> tests B, G, I at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 5 (which is allowed, since we only know N is not at position 4).

We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We are going to get feedback on the positions of N and E (we already know E is at 5, so we'll get a check for E). For N, we'll get feedback: if it's at the correct position, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if it's in the word but wrong position) or an x (if not in the word).

But we also want to test new letters.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it tests three new letters (O, I, S) at positions 2,3,4 and we know N is at 1. Also, if the secret word has O, I, S, we'll get feedback.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" tests U, I, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters. We might get more information.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But let me check: is ""NOISE"" a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (A, C, R). ""NOISE"" has N, O, I, S, E. No A, C, R. Good.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

Now, I need to output it in the required format.

But first, let me think: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then ""UNITE"" would be a good choice because it has N at position 2.

But we don't know. So we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has E and N. We don't know about other vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""NOISE"", we have O and I (vowels) and S (common consonant). In ""UNITE"", we have U and I (vowels) and T (common consonant).

Both are good.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" for now.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include N (since it's in the word) but not at position 4.
- Include E at position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""NOISE"" because:
- It places N at position 1 (a position we haven't tested for N) to see if N belongs there.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4) at positions 2,3,4.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, C, R) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help identify if any of O, I, S are in the word and their positions.",Guess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used. We want to include a mix of vowels and consonants.

I recall that ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), and these letters are all fairly common in English words.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one, with S, L, A, T, E.

But let me think about the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter and position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

For the first guess, I need to pick a valid 5-letter English word. I should avoid words with repeated letters to cover more ground.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a solid choice. It has no repeated letters.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Now, I need to output it in the specified format.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position).
- Does not contain C, R, A.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we have to (but we know C, R, A are out).

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to think of words that end with E and have an N somewhere (but not at position 4). Also, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We know the word has an N and an E. The E is fixed at the end.

Possible positions for N: it cannot be at position 4, but it could be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions.

Some examples:
- INANE: I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, we must avoid A. So not this.
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, has N at position 2, and no A, C, R. Also, we haven't tried U, I, T.

But we don't know if the word has U, I, T. This seems like a good candidate.

Another example: ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N at position 4? But we know N is not at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for CRANE said N was in the word but not at position 4. So in the new word, we can put N at position 1, 2, or 3. In SPINE, N is at position 4? Let me check: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we are not supposed to put N at position 4 because the feedback said N is not in the correct position at 4. So we must avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, in the new word, we should put N at position 1, 2, or 3.

In SPINE, N is at position 4, so that's not allowed. We need a word with N at 1, 2, or 3 and E at 5.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 1: 
- NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> ends with E, N at 1, and no A, C, R. This seems good.

But we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. We can try this.

Another word with N at position 2: 
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> N at 2, and no A, C, R.

Or with N at position 3:
- ANIME: but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- OUNCE: O, U, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

So let's consider:
- NOISE: N at 1, and letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at 5, so that's fixed. We are testing O, I, S at positions 2, 3, and 4? But note: in NOISE, the positions are:
  - N (position 1)
  - O (position 2)
  - I (position 3)
  - S (position 4)
  - E (position 5)

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. In NOISE, N is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, we are testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has N at position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.

But note: we also have the constraint that the word does not contain A, C, R.

Another candidate: ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). Here N is at position 2, which is allowed. We test U, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We need to find the other three letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

In NOISE, we are testing O, I, S. In UNITE, we are testing U, I, T.

Both are good. But note that we have two known letters (N and E) and we are trying three new letters.

We could also consider a word that has the N in a different position, such as position 2 or 3, to see if it fits.

But let me check: are there words with N at position 2 and 5 letters? Like ""INANE"" but that has A (not allowed) and also we don't know about I and N? But we can't use A.

Another word: ""ONISE"" is not a word. ""UNISE"" is not common. ""UNITE"" is common.

What about ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T, E -> ends with E, N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we must avoid putting N at position 4? No, the feedback only said that in CRANE, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. But in the secret word, N might be at position 4? No, because the feedback for CRANE said N is in the word but not at position 4. That means the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4 because we know it's not there. So ""POINT"" has N at position 4, which we should avoid.

So we need a word with N at 1,2, or 3.

Let me list some words:
- N at 1: NOISE, NOBLE, NOOSE, NURSE, etc. (must end with E, so N _ _ _ E)
- N at 2: UNITE, ONSET, INLET, etc. (U _ N _ E, or _ N _ _ E)
- N at 3: _ _ N _ E (like POINT but avoid N at 4? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if we put N at 3, then the next position is 4, so we can put a letter at 4 and E at 5. But we know N is not at position 4, but we are not putting N at 4 in this guess? Actually, we can put any letter at 4 as long as we don't put N there? But note: we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. However, we should avoid putting N at position 4 in this guess because we already know that position 4 is not N. So to save a letter, we can put a non-N at position 4.

But in the example, the secret word had only one N? We don't know if it has more. So we can assume one N for now.

So for position 3: 
- We have words like ""MINCE"" (invalid due to C) -> avoid C.
- ""PINNE"": not common, and has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""PINNE"" is not standard.

Better: ""BUNCE"": B, U, N, C, E -> has C (not allowed) and also we avoid C? No, we cannot use C.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> N at position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> again, N at 4, which we should avoid.

So position 3 is tricky? Let me think of words with N at position 3 and ending with E: 
- ""AXONE"": but A is not allowed and X is not common.
- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4? P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> again position 4.

Actually, it's hard to find a word with N at position 3 and E at 5? Because the fourth position is often N? But we need N at 3? Let me clarify: the word must have the letter N at the third position? But in English words, it's common for words to have the Nth letter as a consonant and then the E at the end? But the E is at the fifth, so the fourth can be any letter.

So words like: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at position 4 -> avoid.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

Actually, ""URINE"" has R, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

So let's focus on words without A, C, R.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""ALINE"": but A is not allowed.
- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E -> no A, C, R. And N is not in this word? But we know the word must have an N. So we must include N.

So we need a word that has N at position 1, 2, or 3 and ends with E.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 2: 
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 1: 
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the end. So: 
  - ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that doesn't work.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with N at position 3 and ending with E? Because in English, words with N at position 3 and then E at the end are rare? For example, ""AXINE"" is not common. 

But let's consider: the secret word has E at position 5 and N somewhere (not at position 4). So the word might be like ""UNITE"", ""NOISE"", or ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E.

Another word: ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but that's 5 letters? I-N-L-E-T? No, that's 5: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5? But we have E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the fifth letter. So the fourth letter can be anything, and fifth is E.

So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I found: ""ANODE"": but A is not allowed.

""AGONE"": A not allowed.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E at position 1 and 5? And we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""EXILE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not supposed to use E at position 1? We can use it, but we know that if the secret word has E at position 1, we'll get a check. But we don't know. Also, we are testing X, I, L.

But we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""EXILE"" is acceptable? But it has two E's? That might be okay.

But let me check: ""EXILE"" is a valid word.

But we have to consider: we know E is at position 5, so if we use E at position 1, we might get feedback on that.

But we are trying to get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E in the first position to avoid confusion? But we don't know.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5. So we have E at 2 and N at 5. But we need E at 5, so that's fine. But we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2. Also, we are testing B, G, I.

But ""BEGIN"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""BEGIN"" is acceptable.

Now, let's compare:

Option 1: NOISE -> tests N at position 1, and O, I, S at positions 2,3,4.
Option 2: UNITE -> tests U, I, T at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 2.
Option 3: BEGIN -> tests B, G, I at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 5 (which is allowed, since we only know N is not at position 4).

We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We are going to get feedback on the positions of N and E (we already know E is at 5, so we'll get a check for E). For N, we'll get feedback: if it's at the correct position, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if it's in the word but wrong position) or an x (if not in the word).

But we also want to test new letters.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it tests three new letters (O, I, S) at positions 2,3,4 and we know N is at 1. Also, if the secret word has O, I, S, we'll get feedback.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" tests U, I, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters. We might get more information.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But let me check: is ""NOISE"" a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (A, C, R). ""NOISE"" has N, O, I, S, E. No A, C, R. Good.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

Now, I need to output it in the required format.

But first, let me think: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then ""UNITE"" would be a good choice because it has N at position 2.

But we don't know. So we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has E and N. We don't know about other vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""NOISE"", we have O and I (vowels) and S (common consonant). In ""UNITE"", we have U and I (vowels) and T (common consonant).

Both are good.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" for now.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include N (since it's in the word) but not at position 4.
- Include E at position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""NOISE"" because:
- It places N at position 1 (a position we haven't tested for N) to see if N belongs there.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4) at positions 2,3,4.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, C, R) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help identify if any of O, I, S are in the word and their positions.

We can try this.\n\nAnother word with N at position 2: \n- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> N at 2, and no A, C, R.\n\nOr with N at position 3:\n- ANIME: but A is not allowed -> invalid.\n- OUNCE: O, U, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n- NOISE: N at 1, and letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at 5, so that\'s fixed. We are testing O, I, S at positions 2, 3, and 4? But note: in NOISE, the positions are:\n  - N (position 1)\n  - O (position 2)\n  - I (position 3)\n  - S (position 4)\n  - E (position 5)\n\nWe know N is in the word but not at position 4. In NOISE, N is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, we are testing O, I, S.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has N at position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.\n\nBut note: we also have the constraint that the word does not contain A, C, R.\n\nAnother candidate: ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). Here N is at position 2, which is allowed. We test U, I, T.\n\nWhich one is better? We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We need to find the other three letters.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\nIn NOISE, we are testing O, I, S. In UNITE, we are testing U, I, T.\n\nBoth are good. But note that we have two known letters (N and E) and we are trying three new letters.\n\nWe could also consider a word that has the N in a different position, such as position 2 or 3, to see if it fits.\n\nBut let me check: are there words with N at position 2 and 5 letters? Like ""INANE"" but that has A (not allowed) and also we don\'t know about I and N? But we can\'t use A.\n\nAnother word: ""ONISE"" is not a word. ""UNISE"" is not common. ""UNITE"" is common.\n\nWhat about ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.\n\n""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T, E -> ends with E, N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we must avoid putting N at position 4? No, the feedback only said that in CRANE, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. But in the secret word, N might be at position 4? No, because the feedback for CRANE said N is in the word but not at position 4. That means the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4 because we know it\'s not there. So ""POINT"" has N at position 4, which we should avoid.\n\nSo we need a word with N at 1,2, or 3.\n\nLet me list some words:\n- N at 1: NOISE, NOBLE, NOOSE, NURSE, etc. (must end with E, so N _ _ _ E)\n- N at 2: UNITE, ONSET, INLET, etc. (U _ N _ E, or _ N _ _ E)\n- N at 3: _ _ N _ E (like POINT but avoid N at 4? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if we put N at 3, then the next position is 4, so we can put a letter at 4 and E at 5. But we know N is not at position 4, but we are not putting N at 4 in this guess? Actually, we can put any letter at 4 as long as we don\'t put N there? But note: we know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. However, we should avoid putting N at position 4 in this guess because we already know that position 4 is not N. So to save a letter, we can put a non-N at position 4.\n\nBut in the example, the secret word had only one N? We don\'t know if it has more. So we can assume one N for now.\n\nSo for position 3: \n- We have words like ""MINCE"" (invalid due to C) -> avoid C.\n- ""PINNE"": not common, and has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""PINNE"" is not standard.\n\nBetter: ""BUNCE"": B, U, N, C, E -> has C (not allowed) and also we avoid C? No, we cannot use C.\n\n""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> N at position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> again, N at 4, which we should avoid.\n\nSo position 3 is tricky? Let me think of words with N at position 3 and ending with E: \n- ""AXONE"": but A is not allowed and X is not common.\n- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4? P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> again position 4.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find a word with N at position 3 and E at 5? Because the fourth position is often N? But we need N at 3? Let me clarify: the word must have the letter N at the third position? But in English words, it\'s common for words to have the Nth letter as a consonant and then the E at the end? But the E is at the fifth, so the fourth can be any letter.\n\nSo words like: \n- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)\n- ""PHONE"": N at position 4 -> avoid.\n- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.\n\nActually, ""URINE"" has R, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R.\n\nSo let\'s focus on words without A, C, R.\n\nAnother word with N at position 3: \n- ""ALINE"": but A is not allowed.\n- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E -> no A, C, R. And N is not in this word? But we know the word must have an N. So we must include N.\n\nSo we need a word that has N at position 1, 2, or 3 and ends with E.\n\nLet me try to think of words with N at position 2: \n- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> no A, C, R. Good.\n\nWords with N at position 1: \n- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.\n\nWords with N at position 3: \n- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the end. So: \n  - ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nActually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So for position 3: \n- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)\n- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.\n- ""THINE"": same.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with N at position 3 and ending with E? Because in English, words with N at position 3 and then E at the end are rare? For example, ""AXINE"" is not common. \n\nBut let\'s consider: the secret word has E at position 5 and N somewhere (not at position 4). So the word might be like ""UNITE"", ""NOISE"", or ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E.\n\nAnother word: ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but that\'s 5 letters? I-N-L-E-T? No, that\'s 5: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> but we need E at position 5, so that\'s position 4 and 5? But we have E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the fifth letter. So the fourth letter can be anything, and fifth is E.\n\nSo for position 3: \n- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)\n- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.\n- ""THINE"": same.\n\nActually, I found: ""ANODE"": but A is not allowed.\n\n""AGONE"": A not allowed.\n\n""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E at position 1 and 5? And we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""EXILE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 1. However, we are not supposed to use E at position 1? We can use it, but we know that if the secret word has E at position 1, we\'ll get a check. But we don\'t know. Also, we are testing X, I, L.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""EXILE"" is acceptable? But it has two E\'s? That might be okay.\n\nBut let me check: ""EXILE"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have to consider: we know E is at position 5, so if we use E at position 1, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have E in the first position to avoid confusion? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word with N at position 3: \n- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that\'s position 4 and 5. So we have E at 2 and N at 5. But we need E at 5, so that\'s fine. But we are putting E at position 2? We don\'t know if E is at position 2. Also, we are testing B, G, I.\n\nBut ""BEGIN"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""BEGIN"" is acceptable.\n\nNow, let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: NOISE -> tests N at position 1, and O, I, S at positions 2,3,4.\nOption 2: UNITE -> tests U, I, T at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 2.\nOption 3: BEGIN -> tests B, G, I at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 5 (which is allowed, since we only know N is not at position 4).\n\nWe want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We are going to get feedback on the positions of N and E (we already know E is at 5, so we\'ll get a check for E). For N, we\'ll get feedback: if it\'s at the correct position, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if it\'s in the word but wrong position) or an x (if not in the word).\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it tests three new letters (O, I, S) at positions 2,3,4 and we know N is at 1. Also, if the secret word has O, I, S, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" tests U, I, T.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters. We might get more information.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check: is ""NOISE"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the forbidden letters (A, C, R). ""NOISE"" has N, O, I, S, E. No A, C, R. Good.\n\nSo my second guess is ""NOISE"".\n\nNow, I need to output it in the required format.\n\nBut first, let me think: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then ""UNITE"" would be a good choice because it has N at position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know. So we can choose either.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has E and N. We don\'t know about other vowels. We haven\'t tried O, I, U.\n\nIn ""NOISE"", we have O and I (vowels) and S (common consonant). In ""UNITE"", we have U and I (vowels) and T (common consonant).\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""NOISE"" for now.\n\nSo my second guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, A are not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not at position 4.\n- E is in the word and at position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include N (since it\'s in the word) but not at position 4.\n- Include E at position 5.\n- Avoid using C, R, A.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""NOISE"" because:\n- It places N at position 1 (a position we haven\'t tested for N) to see if N belongs there.\n- It tests three new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4) at positions 2,3,4.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, C, R) and uses no duplicates.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of O, I, S are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>NOISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for N at position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is in the word and at position 5.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has E at position 5 and S at position 4. So the word ends with ""ES"".
2. The word contains N, but not at position 4 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess). So N must be at position 2 or 3.
3. The word does not contain: C, R, A, O.

We also know that the first letter cannot be N (because of second guess) and cannot be C, R, A (from first guess).

Let's list the known information:
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E
- N is in the word at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we know position 4 is S, so I cannot be there either).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word ending with ""ES"" (since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E).
- Contains N (but not at position 4, and not at position 1, so only positions 2 or 3).
- Contains I (but not at position 3).
- Does not contain C, R, A, O.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible positions for N:
- We have two possibilities: position 2 or 3.

But note: we don't know which one is correct. So we can try to cover both possibilities? However, we can only put N in one position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 2 and then other new letters, or in position 3 and other new letters.

We also need to include I (since it's in the word) and avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that end with ""ES"" and have N and I.

Common words ending with ""ES"":
- MINES
- DINES
- TINES
- WINES
- etc.

But we must avoid A, C, R, O.

Also, we know that I is in the word but not at position 3. So in our guess, we can put I in position 1,2,4? But position 4 is S, so I cannot be at position 4. So I can be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, N must be at 2 or 3.

Let's try to form a word that has N at position 2 and I at position 1? Or position 2? Or position 1?

We can try:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but we have I at position 1, N at position 2, and then L, E, T. But note: position 4 is S, so we have L at position 3 and E at 4? But we need E at position 5. So ""INLET"" ends with T, not E. So invalid.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two are S and E.

So the word pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not C, R, A, O.

We also know that N is in the word at position 2 or 3.

Let's try to put N at position 2 and I at position 1? Then we have: I N _ S E

What can we put at position 3? It cannot be C, R, A, O. And we want to test new letters.

Possible words: 
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 3 and 5? But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 3. However, we must avoid A, C, R, O. ""INES"" has E at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if E is at position 3. Also, we are testing E at position 3? But we already know E is at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on that.

But note: we are allowed to use E again? The rules don't say we can't. But we know the word has at least one E (at position 5). It might have more.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E to test other letters.

But let's consider: if we put E at position 3, and the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

But we are trying to find the first three letters.

We can try ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so the E at position 3 might be a duplicate? But the feedback will tell us.

But we are also testing I at position 1 and N at position 2.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, O.

""INES"" has I, N, E, S, E. No A, C, R, O. Good.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word with N at position 2 and I at position 1: ""INLET"" is not valid because it ends with T, not E.

""INES"" is valid.

But we can also try N at position 3.

Let's try to put N at position 3: so pattern: _ _ N S E

What words? 
- ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> ends with E? M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is E? But we know position 4 is S. So invalid.

- ""DINES"": D, I, N, E, S -> same issue, position 4 is E, but we need S at position 4. So invalid.

- ""TINES"": T, I, N, E, S -> same.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must be ? ? N S E.

What words end with ""NS""? Not common. 

Actually, words ending with ""NS"" are rare. 

Let me think of words with pattern _ _ N S E:
- ""MINSE"": not a word.
- ""DINSE"": not a word.
- ""TINSE"": not a word.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. 

So probably N is at position 2.

Therefore, the word is likely I N ? S E, with ? being a letter that can form a word.

So words: 
- INANE: but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).
- INLET: not ending with E.
- INNES: not a word.
- INOES: not a word.
- INOES is not valid.

Valid words: 
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. And we know E is at position 5, so if the word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

But we can also try ""INES"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> ends with E? I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And no A, C, R, O. And it has I at position 1 and N at position 2.

And we test U at position 3.

But we also have to consider that I is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1.

But we don't know if I is at position 1 or not.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have I? But we know I is in the word, so we should include it to get information.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

We know the word has N (at 2 or 3), I (somewhere not 3), S (at 4), E (at 5).

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] S E

With letter1, letter2, letter3 not being C, R, A, O.

And we must include N and I (but I cannot be at position 3, which is already satisfied because in this pattern N is at 2 or 3, and I is at 1).

So let's go with ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E

But let me check if ""INES"" is valid: yes, it is.

But we have two E's. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about other E's.

In ""INES"", we have E at position 3 and 5.

If the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.

Similarly, we test I at position 1 and N at position 2.

But we already know N is in the word, so if we put N at position 2 and it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at position 3) or x (if not at 2).

Similarly for I.

But we also test E at position 3.

But we might get confused with two E's.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.

For example, ""UNISE"": U, N, I, S, E -> but we have U, N, I, S, E. No A, C, R, O. And ends with E? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And I is at position 3? But in the feedback for guess 2, we know that I is not at position 3 (because in NOISE, I was at position 3 and got a minus). So we cannot put I at position 3.

In ""UNISE"", I is at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed because we know I is not at position 3.

So we must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, in our guess, I must be at position 1 or 2.

So let's try to put I at position 1 and N at position 2: I N ? S E

What can we put at position 3? We need a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E at position 3 and 5.
- ""INLET"": not ending with E.
- ""INNED"": not a word.
- ""INNED"" is not valid.
- ""INNED"" is not valid.

Actually, ""INES"" is a word.

Another: ""INUES"": not common.

""INES"" seems good.

But we have two E's. We might get feedback that E is at position 3? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.

For example, ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> but we have I at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed.

So we must avoid I at position 3.

Therefore, for the pattern I N ? S E, the third letter must be something else.

What about ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at 1, N at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5. And no A, C, R, O. And U is a new letter.

So ""INUSE"" is a valid word.

We can also consider ""INLET"" is not valid.

Another word: ""INNED"" is not valid.

So between ""INES"" and ""INUSE"", both are valid.

But ""INUSE"" avoids E at position 3, which might be better because we can test U without confusion.

But we are testing U at position 3.

We can also try a word that has N at position 3.

Let me try to find a word with N at position 3: _ _ N S E

What words? 
- ""MINSE"": not a word.
- ""DINSE"": not a word.
- ""TINSE"": not a word.
- ""WINSE"": not a word.
- ""PINSE"": not a word.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. 

So probably N is at position 2.

Therefore, I will go with ""INUSE"": to test I at position 1, N at position 2, and U at position 3.

But we also test E at position 3? But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 3.

So let's guess ""INUSE"".

But note: we have two E's in ""INUSE"". The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about other E's.

If the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.

Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then we know E is not at position 3.

But we are also testing U at position 3.

So let's go with ""INUSE"".

But wait: we have to make sure the word is valid.

""INUSE"" is a valid word (a biological term).

So my third guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me think: we have I at position 1, N at position 2, U at position 3, S at 4, E at 5.

We are testing I at 1, U at 3, and also we are confirming the position of N.

But we know N is in the word, so if we put it at 2 and it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at 3) or x (if not at 2).

Similarly for I.

But we also test U.

So let's output ""INUSE"".

But note: we have two E's. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about position 3. So if we put E at position 3 and it's not in the word, we get an x. If it is in the word but wrong position, we get a minus. If correct, we get a check.

But we are also testing U at position 3.

So let's go with ""INUSE"".

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So my third guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E

This matches the pattern.

So I'll guess ""INUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at position 5? But we know it's there, so we can use it to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E at position 3 to avoid confusion? But we need to test E at position 3? Actually, we don't need to test E at position 3 because we already know E is at position 5. But we don't know if there is another E.

But if we don't test E at position 3, we might miss information.

But we can test E at position 3 in a later guess if needed.

So for now, let's go with ""INUSE"".

So the guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, A, O.

""INUSE"" has I, N, U, S, E. No C, R, A, O. Good.

So <guess>INUSE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
- N is in the word but not at position 4 (from CRANE) or position 1 (from NOISE), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (from NOISE), so it must be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters C, R, A, O are not in the word.

For the third guess, I need to test the positions of N and I while introducing new letters. I chose ""INUSE"" because:
- It places I at position 1 (to test if I is at position 1) and N at position 2 (to test if N is at position 2).
- It tests U at position 3 (a new letter) and confirms the position of S and E.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, O) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three letters.

<guess>INUSE</guess>",INUSE,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for N at position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is in the word and at position 5.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has E at position 5 and S at position 4. So the word ends with ""ES"".
2. The word contains N, but not at position 4 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess). So N must be at position 2 or 3.
3. The word does not contain: C, R, A, O.

We also know that the first letter cannot be N (because of second guess) and cannot be C, R, A (from first guess).

Let's list the known information:
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E
- N is in the word at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we know position 4 is S, so I cannot be there either).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word ending with ""ES"" (since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E).
- Contains N (but not at position 4, and not at position 1, so only positions 2 or 3).
- Contains I (but not at position 3).
- Does not contain C, R, A, O.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible positions for N:
- We have two possibilities: position 2 or 3.

But note: we don't know which one is correct. So we can try to cover both possibilities? However, we can only put N in one position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 2 and then other new letters, or in position 3 and other new letters.

We also need to include I (since it's in the word) and avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that end with ""ES"" and have N and I.

Common words ending with ""ES"":
- MINES
- DINES
- TINES
- WINES
- etc.

But we must avoid A, C, R, O.

Also, we know that I is in the word but not at position 3. So in our guess, we can put I in position 1,2,4? But position 4 is S, so I cannot be at position 4. So I can be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, N must be at 2 or 3.

Let's try to form a word that has N at position 2 and I at position 1? Or position 2? Or position 1?

We can try:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but we have I at position 1, N at position 2, and then L, E, T. But note: position 4 is S, so we have L at position 3 and E at 4? But we need E at position 5. So ""INLET"" ends with T, not E. So invalid.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two are S and E.

So the word pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not C, R, A, O.

We also know that N is in the word at position 2 or 3.

Let's try to put N at position 2 and I at position 1? Then we have: I N _ S E

What can we put at position 3? It cannot be C, R, A, O. And we want to test new letters.

Possible words: 
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 3 and 5? But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 3. However, we must avoid A, C, R, O. ""INES"" has E at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if E is at position 3. Also, we are testing E at position 3? But we already know E is at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on that.

But note: we are allowed to use E again? The rules don't say we can't. But we know the word has at least one E (at position 5). It might have more.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E to test other letters.

But let's consider: if we put E at position 3, and the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

But we are trying to find the first three letters.

We can try ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so the E at position 3 might be a duplicate? But the feedback will tell us.

But we are also testing I at position 1 and N at position 2.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, O.

""INES"" has I, N, E, S, E. No A, C, R, O. Good.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word with N at position 2 and I at position 1: ""INLET"" is not valid because it ends with T, not E.

""INES"" is valid.

But we can also try N at position 3.

Let's try to put N at position 3: so pattern: _ _ N S E

What words? 
- ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> ends with E? M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is E? But we know position 4 is S. So invalid.

- ""DINES"": D, I, N, E, S -> same issue, position 4 is E, but we need S at position 4. So invalid.

- ""TINES"": T, I, N, E, S -> same.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must be ? ? N S E.

What words end with ""NS""? Not common. 

Actually, words ending with ""NS"" are rare. 

Let me think of words with pattern _ _ N S E:
- ""MINSE"": not a word.
- ""DINSE"": not a word.
- ""TINSE"": not a word.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. 

So probably N is at position 2.

Therefore, the word is likely I N ? S E, with ? being a letter that can form a word.

So words: 
- INANE: but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).
- INLET: not ending with E.
- INNES: not a word.
- INOES: not a word.
- INOES is not valid.

Valid words: 
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. And we know E is at position 5, so if the word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

But we can also try ""INES"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> ends with E? I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And no A, C, R, O. And it has I at position 1 and N at position 2.

And we test U at position 3.

But we also have to consider that I is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1.

But we don't know if I is at position 1 or not.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have I? But we know I is in the word, so we should include it to get information.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

We know the word has N (at 2 or 3), I (somewhere not 3), S (at 4), E (at 5).

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] S E

With letter1, letter2, letter3 not being C, R, A, O.

And we must include N and I (but I cannot be at position 3, which is already satisfied because in this pattern N is at 2 or 3, and I is at 1).

So let's go with ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E

But let me check if ""INES"" is valid: yes, it is.

But we have two E's. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about other E's.

In ""INES"", we have E at position 3 and 5.

If the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.

Similarly, we test I at position 1 and N at position 2.

But we already know N is in the word, so if we put N at position 2 and it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at position 3) or x (if not at 2).

Similarly for I.

But we also test E at position 3.

But we might get confused with two E's.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.

For example, ""UNISE"": U, N, I, S, E -> but we have U, N, I, S, E. No A, C, R, O. And ends with E? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And I is at position 3? But in the feedback for guess 2, we know that I is not at position 3 (because in NOISE, I was at position 3 and got a minus). So we cannot put I at position 3.

In ""UNISE"", I is at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed because we know I is not at position 3.

So we must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, in our guess, I must be at position 1 or 2.

So let's try to put I at position 1 and N at position 2: I N ? S E

What can we put at position 3? We need a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E at position 3 and 5.
- ""INLET"": not ending with E.
- ""INNED"": not a word.
- ""INNED"" is not valid.
- ""INNED"" is not valid.

Actually, ""INES"" is a word.

Another: ""INUES"": not common.

""INES"" seems good.

But we have two E's. We might get feedback that E is at position 3? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.

For example, ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> but we have I at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed.

So we must avoid I at position 3.

Therefore, for the pattern I N ? S E, the third letter must be something else.

What about ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at 1, N at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5. And no A, C, R, O. And U is a new letter.

So ""INUSE"" is a valid word.

We can also consider ""INLET"" is not valid.

Another word: ""INNED"" is not valid.

So between ""INES"" and ""INUSE"", both are valid.

But ""INUSE"" avoids E at position 3, which might be better because we can test U without confusion.

But we are testing U at position 3.

We can also try a word that has N at position 3.

Let me try to find a word with N at position 3: _ _ N S E

What words? 
- ""MINSE"": not a word.
- ""DINSE"": not a word.
- ""TINSE"": not a word.
- ""WINSE"": not a word.
- ""PINSE"": not a word.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. 

So probably N is at position 2.

Therefore, I will go with ""INUSE"": to test I at position 1, N at position 2, and U at position 3.

But we also test E at position 3? But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 3.

So let's guess ""INUSE"".

But note: we have two E's in ""INUSE"". The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about other E's.

If the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.

Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then we know E is not at position 3.

But we are also testing U at position 3.

So let's go with ""INUSE"".

But wait: we have to make sure the word is valid.

""INUSE"" is a valid word (a biological term).

So my third guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me think: we have I at position 1, N at position 2, U at position 3, S at 4, E at 5.

We are testing I at 1, U at 3, and also we are confirming the position of N.

But we know N is in the word, so if we put it at 2 and it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at 3) or x (if not at 2).

Similarly for I.

But we also test U.

So let's output ""INUSE"".

But note: we have two E's. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about position 3. So if we put E at position 3 and it's not in the word, we get an x. If it is in the word but wrong position, we get a minus. If correct, we get a check.

But we are also testing U at position 3.

So let's go with ""INUSE"".

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So my third guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E

This matches the pattern.

So I'll guess ""INUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at position 5? But we know it's there, so we can use it to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E at position 3 to avoid confusion? But we need to test E at position 3? Actually, we don't need to test E at position 3 because we already know E is at position 5. But we don't know if there is another E.

But if we don't test E at position 3, we might miss information.

But we can test E at position 3 in a later guess if needed.

So for now, let's go with ""INUSE"".

So the guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, A, O.

""INUSE"" has I, N, U, S, E. No C, R, A, O. Good.

So <guess>INUSE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
- N is in the word but not at position 4 (from CRANE) or position 1 (from NOISE), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (from NOISE), so it must be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters C, R, A, O are not in the word.

For the third guess, I need to test the positions of N and I while introducing new letters. I chose ""INUSE"" because:
- It places I at position 1 (to test if I is at position 1) and N at position 2 (to test if N is at position 2).
- It tests U at position 3 (a new letter) and confirms the position of S and E.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, O) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three letters.",Guess 3: INUSE -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) U(x) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used. We want to include a mix of vowels and consonants.

I recall that ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), and these letters are all fairly common in English words.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one, with S, L, A, T, E.

But let me think about the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter and position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

For the first guess, I need to pick a valid 5-letter English word. I should avoid words with repeated letters to cover more ground.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a solid choice. It has no repeated letters.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Now, I need to output it in the specified format.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
- Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position).
- Does not contain C, R, A.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we have to (but we know C, R, A are out).

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to think of words that end with E and have an N somewhere (but not at position 4). Also, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We know the word has an N and an E. The E is fixed at the end.

Possible positions for N: it cannot be at position 4, but it could be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions.

Some examples:
- INANE: I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, we must avoid A. So not this.
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, has N at position 2, and no A, C, R. Also, we haven't tried U, I, T.

But we don't know if the word has U, I, T. This seems like a good candidate.

Another example: ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N at position 4? But we know N is not at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for CRANE said N was in the word but not at position 4. So in the new word, we can put N at position 1, 2, or 3. In SPINE, N is at position 4? Let me check: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we are not supposed to put N at position 4 because the feedback said N is not in the correct position at 4. So we must avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, in the new word, we should put N at position 1, 2, or 3.

In SPINE, N is at position 4, so that's not allowed. We need a word with N at 1, 2, or 3 and E at 5.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 1: 
- NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> ends with E, N at 1, and no A, C, R. This seems good.

But we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. We can try this.

Another word with N at position 2: 
- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> N at 2, and no A, C, R.

Or with N at position 3:
- ANIME: but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- OUNCE: O, U, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

So let's consider:
- NOISE: N at 1, and letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at 5, so that's fixed. We are testing O, I, S at positions 2, 3, and 4? But note: in NOISE, the positions are:
  - N (position 1)
  - O (position 2)
  - I (position 3)
  - S (position 4)
  - E (position 5)

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. In NOISE, N is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, we are testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has N at position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.

But note: we also have the constraint that the word does not contain A, C, R.

Another candidate: ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). Here N is at position 2, which is allowed. We test U, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We need to find the other three letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

In NOISE, we are testing O, I, S. In UNITE, we are testing U, I, T.

Both are good. But note that we have two known letters (N and E) and we are trying three new letters.

We could also consider a word that has the N in a different position, such as position 2 or 3, to see if it fits.

But let me check: are there words with N at position 2 and 5 letters? Like ""INANE"" but that has A (not allowed) and also we don't know about I and N? But we can't use A.

Another word: ""ONISE"" is not a word. ""UNISE"" is not common. ""UNITE"" is common.

What about ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T, E -> ends with E, N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we must avoid putting N at position 4? No, the feedback only said that in CRANE, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. But in the secret word, N might be at position 4? No, because the feedback for CRANE said N is in the word but not at position 4. That means the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4 because we know it's not there. So ""POINT"" has N at position 4, which we should avoid.

So we need a word with N at 1,2, or 3.

Let me list some words:
- N at 1: NOISE, NOBLE, NOOSE, NURSE, etc. (must end with E, so N _ _ _ E)
- N at 2: UNITE, ONSET, INLET, etc. (U _ N _ E, or _ N _ _ E)
- N at 3: _ _ N _ E (like POINT but avoid N at 4? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if we put N at 3, then the next position is 4, so we can put a letter at 4 and E at 5. But we know N is not at position 4, but we are not putting N at 4 in this guess? Actually, we can put any letter at 4 as long as we don't put N there? But note: we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. However, we should avoid putting N at position 4 in this guess because we already know that position 4 is not N. So to save a letter, we can put a non-N at position 4.

But in the example, the secret word had only one N? We don't know if it has more. So we can assume one N for now.

So for position 3: 
- We have words like ""MINCE"" (invalid due to C) -> avoid C.
- ""PINNE"": not common, and has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""PINNE"" is not standard.

Better: ""BUNCE"": B, U, N, C, E -> has C (not allowed) and also we avoid C? No, we cannot use C.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> N at position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> again, N at 4, which we should avoid.

So position 3 is tricky? Let me think of words with N at position 3 and ending with E: 
- ""AXONE"": but A is not allowed and X is not common.
- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4? P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> again position 4.

Actually, it's hard to find a word with N at position 3 and E at 5? Because the fourth position is often N? But we need N at 3? Let me clarify: the word must have the letter N at the third position? But in English words, it's common for words to have the Nth letter as a consonant and then the E at the end? But the E is at the fifth, so the fourth can be any letter.

So words like: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at position 4 -> avoid.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

Actually, ""URINE"" has R, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

So let's focus on words without A, C, R.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""ALINE"": but A is not allowed.
- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E -> no A, C, R. And N is not in this word? But we know the word must have an N. So we must include N.

So we need a word that has N at position 1, 2, or 3 and ends with E.

Let me try to think of words with N at position 2: 
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 1: 
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Words with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the end. So: 
  - ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that doesn't work.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with N at position 3 and ending with E? Because in English, words with N at position 3 and then E at the end are rare? For example, ""AXINE"" is not common. 

But let's consider: the secret word has E at position 5 and N somewhere (not at position 4). So the word might be like ""UNITE"", ""NOISE"", or ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E.

Another word: ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but that's 5 letters? I-N-L-E-T? No, that's 5: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5? But we have E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the fifth letter. So the fourth letter can be anything, and fifth is E.

So for position 3: 
- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)
- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.
- ""THINE"": same.

Actually, I found: ""ANODE"": but A is not allowed.

""AGONE"": A not allowed.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E at position 1 and 5? And we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""EXILE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not supposed to use E at position 1? We can use it, but we know that if the secret word has E at position 1, we'll get a check. But we don't know. Also, we are testing X, I, L.

But we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""EXILE"" is acceptable? But it has two E's? That might be okay.

But let me check: ""EXILE"" is a valid word.

But we have to consider: we know E is at position 5, so if we use E at position 1, we might get feedback on that.

But we are trying to get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E in the first position to avoid confusion? But we don't know.

Another word with N at position 3: 
- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that's position 4 and 5. So we have E at 2 and N at 5. But we need E at 5, so that's fine. But we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2. Also, we are testing B, G, I.

But ""BEGIN"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""BEGIN"" is acceptable.

Now, let's compare:

Option 1: NOISE -> tests N at position 1, and O, I, S at positions 2,3,4.
Option 2: UNITE -> tests U, I, T at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 2.
Option 3: BEGIN -> tests B, G, I at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 5 (which is allowed, since we only know N is not at position 4).

We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We are going to get feedback on the positions of N and E (we already know E is at 5, so we'll get a check for E). For N, we'll get feedback: if it's at the correct position, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if it's in the word but wrong position) or an x (if not in the word).

But we also want to test new letters.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it tests three new letters (O, I, S) at positions 2,3,4 and we know N is at 1. Also, if the secret word has O, I, S, we'll get feedback.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" tests U, I, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters. We might get more information.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But let me check: is ""NOISE"" a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (A, C, R). ""NOISE"" has N, O, I, S, E. No A, C, R. Good.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

Now, I need to output it in the required format.

But first, let me think: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then ""UNITE"" would be a good choice because it has N at position 2.

But we don't know. So we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has E and N. We don't know about other vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""NOISE"", we have O and I (vowels) and S (common consonant). In ""UNITE"", we have U and I (vowels) and T (common consonant).

Both are good.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" for now.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include N (since it's in the word) but not at position 4.
- Include E at position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""NOISE"" because:
- It places N at position 1 (a position we haven't tested for N) to see if N belongs there.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4) at positions 2,3,4.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, C, R) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help identify if any of O, I, S are in the word and their positions.

<guess>NOISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for N at position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is in the word and at position 5.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has E at position 5 and S at position 4. So the word ends with ""ES"".
2. The word contains N, but not at position 4 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess). So N must be at position 2 or 3.
3. The word does not contain: C, R, A, O.

We also know that the first letter cannot be N (because of second guess) and cannot be C, R, A (from first guess).

Let's list the known information:
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E
- N is in the word at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we know position 4 is S, so I cannot be there either).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word ending with ""ES"" (since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E).
- Contains N (but not at position 4, and not at position 1, so only positions 2 or 3).
- Contains I (but not at position 3).
- Does not contain C, R, A, O.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible positions for N:
- We have two possibilities: position 2 or 3.

But note: we don't know which one is correct. So we can try to cover both possibilities? However, we can only put N in one position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 2 and then other new letters, or in position 3 and other new letters.

We also need to include I (since it's in the word) and avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that end with ""ES"" and have N and I.

Common words ending with ""ES"":
- MINES
- DINES
- TINES
- WINES
- etc.

But we must avoid A, C, R, O.

Also, we know that I is in the word but not at position 3. So in our guess, we can put I in position 1,2,4? But position 4 is S, so I cannot be at position 4. So I can be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, N must be at 2 or 3.

Let's try to form a word that has N at position 2 and I at position 1? Or position 2? Or position 1?

We can try:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but we have I at position 1, N at position 2, and then L, E, T. But note: position 4 is S, so we have L at position 3 and E at 4? But we need E at position 5. So ""INLET"" ends with T, not E. So invalid.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two are S and E.

So the word pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not C, R, A, O.

We also know that N is in the word at position 2 or 3.

Let's try to put N at position 2 and I at position 1? Then we have: I N _ S E

What can we put at position 3? It cannot be C, R, A, O. And we want to test new letters.

Possible words: 
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 3 and 5? But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 3. However, we must avoid A, C, R, O. ""INES"" has E at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if E is at position 3. Also, we are testing E at position 3? But we already know E is at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on that.

But note: we are allowed to use E again? The rules don't say we can't. But we know the word has at least one E (at position 5). It might have more.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E to test other letters.

But let's consider: if we put E at position 3, and the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

But we are trying to find the first three letters.

We can try ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so the E at position 3 might be a duplicate? But the feedback will tell us.

But we are also testing I at position 1 and N at position 2.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, O.

""INES"" has I, N, E, S, E. No A, C, R, O. Good.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word with N at position 2 and I at position 1: ""INLET"" is not valid because it ends with T, not E.

""INES"" is valid.

But we can also try N at position 3.

Let's try to put N at position 3: so pattern: _ _ N S E

What words? 
- ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> ends with E? M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is E? But we know position 4 is S. So invalid.

- ""DINES"": D, I, N, E, S -> same issue, position 4 is E, but we need S at position 4. So invalid.

- ""TINES"": T, I, N, E, S -> same.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must be ? ? N S E.

What words end with ""NS""? Not common. 

Actually, words ending with ""NS"" are rare. 

Let me think of words with pattern _ _ N S E:
- ""MINSE"": not a word.
- ""DINSE"": not a word.
- ""TINSE"": not a word.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. 

So probably N is at position 2.

Therefore, the word is likely I N ? S E, with ? being a letter that can form a word.

So words: 
- INANE: but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).
- INLET: not ending with E.
- INNES: not a word.
- INOES: not a word.
- INOES is not valid.

Valid words: 
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. And we know E is at position 5, so if the word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

But we can also try ""INES"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> ends with E? I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And no A, C, R, O. And it has I at position 1 and N at position 2.

And we test U at position 3.

But we also have to consider that I is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1.

But we don't know if I is at position 1 or not.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have I? But we know I is in the word, so we should include it to get information.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

We know the word has N (at 2 or 3), I (somewhere not 3), S (at 4), E (at 5).

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] S E

With letter1, letter2, letter3 not being C, R, A, O.

And we must include N and I (but I cannot be at position 3, which is already satisfied because in this pattern N is at 2 or 3, and I is at 1).

So let's go with ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E

But let me check if ""INES"" is valid: yes, it is.

But we have two E's. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about other E's.

In ""INES"", we have E at position 3 and 5.

If the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.

Similarly, we test I at position 1 and N at position 2.

But we already know N is in the word, so if we put N at position 2 and it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at position 3) or x (if not at 2).

Similarly for I.

But we also test E at position 3.

But we might get confused with two E's.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.

For example, ""UNISE"": U, N, I, S, E -> but we have U, N, I, S, E. No A, C, R, O. And ends with E? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And I is at position 3? But in the feedback for guess 2, we know that I is not at position 3 (because in NOISE, I was at position 3 and got a minus). So we cannot put I at position 3.

In ""UNISE"", I is at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed because we know I is not at position 3.

So we must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, in our guess, I must be at position 1 or 2.

So let's try to put I at position 1 and N at position 2: I N ? S E

What can we put at position 3? We need a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E at position 3 and 5.
- ""INLET"": not ending with E.
- ""INNED"": not a word.
- ""INNED"" is not valid.
- ""INNED"" is not valid.

Actually, ""INES"" is a word.

Another: ""INUES"": not common.

""INES"" seems good.

But we have two E's. We might get feedback that E is at position 3? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.

For example, ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> but we have I at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed.

So we must avoid I at position 3.

Therefore, for the pattern I N ? S E, the third letter must be something else.

What about ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at 1, N at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5. And no A, C, R, O. And U is a new letter.

So ""INUSE"" is a valid word.

We can also consider ""INLET"" is not valid.

Another word: ""INNED"" is not valid.

So between ""INES"" and ""INUSE"", both are valid.

But ""INUSE"" avoids E at position 3, which might be better because we can test U without confusion.

But we are testing U at position 3.

We can also try a word that has N at position 3.

Let me try to find a word with N at position 3: _ _ N S E

What words? 
- ""MINSE"": not a word.
- ""DINSE"": not a word.
- ""TINSE"": not a word.
- ""WINSE"": not a word.
- ""PINSE"": not a word.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. 

So probably N is at position 2.

Therefore, I will go with ""INUSE"": to test I at position 1, N at position 2, and U at position 3.

But we also test E at position 3? But we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 3.

So let's guess ""INUSE"".

But note: we have two E's in ""INUSE"". The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about other E's.

If the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.

Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then we know E is not at position 3.

But we are also testing U at position 3.

So let's go with ""INUSE"".

But wait: we have to make sure the word is valid.

""INUSE"" is a valid word (a biological term).

So my third guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me think: we have I at position 1, N at position 2, U at position 3, S at 4, E at 5.

We are testing I at 1, U at 3, and also we are confirming the position of N.

But we know N is in the word, so if we put it at 2 and it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at 3) or x (if not at 2).

Similarly for I.

But we also test U.

So let's output ""INUSE"".

But note: we have two E's. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don't know about position 3. So if we put E at position 3 and it's not in the word, we get an x. If it is in the word but wrong position, we get a minus. If correct, we get a check.

But we are also testing U at position 3.

So let's go with ""INUSE"".

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So my third guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E

This matches the pattern.

So I'll guess ""INUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at position 5? But we know it's there, so we can use it to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E at position 3 to avoid confusion? But we need to test E at position 3? Actually, we don't need to test E at position 3 because we already know E is at position 5. But we don't know if there is another E.

But if we don't test E at position 3, we might miss information.

But we can test E at position 3 in a later guess if needed.

So for now, let's go with ""INUSE"".

So the guess is ""INUSE"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, A, O.

""INUSE"" has I, N, U, S, E. No C, R, A, O. Good.

So <guess>INUSE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
- N is in the word but not at position 4 (from CRANE) or position 1 (from NOISE), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (from NOISE), so it must be at position 1 or 2.
- Letters C, R, A, O are not in the word.

For the third guess, I need to test the positions of N and I while introducing new letters. I chose ""INUSE"" because:
- It places I at position 1 (to test if I is at position 1) and N at position 2 (to test if N is at position 2).
- It tests U at position 3 (a new letter) and confirms the position of S and E.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, O) and uses no duplicates.

This guess will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three letters.

In SPINE, N is at position 4? Let me check: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we are not supposed to put N at position 4 because the feedback said N is not in the correct position at 4. So we must avoid putting N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, in the new word, we should put N at position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nIn SPINE, N is at position 4, so that\'s not allowed. We need a word with N at 1, 2, or 3 and E at 5.\n\nLet me try to think of words with N at position 1: \n- NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> ends with E, N at 1, and no A, C, R. This seems good.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O, I, S are in the word. We can try this.\n\nAnother word with N at position 2: \n- UNITE: U, N, I, T, E -> N at 2, and no A, C, R.\n\nOr with N at position 3:\n- ANIME: but A is not allowed -> invalid.\n- OUNCE: O, U, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n- NOISE: N at 1, and letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at 5, so that\'s fixed. We are testing O, I, S at positions 2, 3, and 4? But note: in NOISE, the positions are:\n  - N (position 1)\n  - O (position 2)\n  - I (position 3)\n  - S (position 4)\n  - E (position 5)\n\nWe know N is in the word but not at position 4. In NOISE, N is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, we are testing O, I, S.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has N at position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.\n\nBut note: we also have the constraint that the word does not contain A, C, R.\n\nAnother candidate: ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). Here N is at position 2, which is allowed. We test U, I, T.\n\nWhich one is better? We want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We need to find the other three letters.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\nIn NOISE, we are testing O, I, S. In UNITE, we are testing U, I, T.\n\nBoth are good. But note that we have two known letters (N and E) and we are trying three new letters.\n\nWe could also consider a word that has the N in a different position, such as position 2 or 3, to see if it fits.\n\nBut let me check: are there words with N at position 2 and 5 letters? Like ""INANE"" but that has A (not allowed) and also we don\'t know about I and N? But we can\'t use A.\n\nAnother word: ""ONISE"" is not a word. ""UNISE"" is not common. ""UNITE"" is common.\n\nWhat about ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have to avoid C. So invalid.\n\n""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T, E -> ends with E, N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we must avoid putting N at position 4? No, the feedback only said that in CRANE, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. But in the secret word, N might be at position 4? No, because the feedback for CRANE said N is in the word but not at position 4. That means the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4 because we know it\'s not there. So ""POINT"" has N at position 4, which we should avoid.\n\nSo we need a word with N at 1,2, or 3.\n\nLet me list some words:\n- N at 1: NOISE, NOBLE, NOOSE, NURSE, etc. (must end with E, so N _ _ _ E)\n- N at 2: UNITE, ONSET, INLET, etc. (U _ N _ E, or _ N _ _ E)\n- N at 3: _ _ N _ E (like POINT but avoid N at 4? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if we put N at 3, then the next position is 4, so we can put a letter at 4 and E at 5. But we know N is not at position 4, but we are not putting N at 4 in this guess? Actually, we can put any letter at 4 as long as we don\'t put N there? But note: we know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. However, we should avoid putting N at position 4 in this guess because we already know that position 4 is not N. So to save a letter, we can put a non-N at position 4.\n\nBut in the example, the secret word had only one N? We don\'t know if it has more. So we can assume one N for now.\n\nSo for position 3: \n- We have words like ""MINCE"" (invalid due to C) -> avoid C.\n- ""PINNE"": not common, and has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""PINNE"" is not standard.\n\nBetter: ""BUNCE"": B, U, N, C, E -> has C (not allowed) and also we avoid C? No, we cannot use C.\n\n""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> N at position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> again, N at 4, which we should avoid.\n\nSo position 3 is tricky? Let me think of words with N at position 3 and ending with E: \n- ""AXONE"": but A is not allowed and X is not common.\n- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4? P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> again position 4.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find a word with N at position 3 and E at 5? Because the fourth position is often N? But we need N at 3? Let me clarify: the word must have the letter N at the third position? But in English words, it\'s common for words to have the Nth letter as a consonant and then the E at the end? But the E is at the fifth, so the fourth can be any letter.\n\nSo words like: \n- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)\n- ""PHONE"": N at position 4 -> avoid.\n- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.\n\nActually, ""URINE"" has R, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R.\n\nSo let\'s focus on words without A, C, R.\n\nAnother word with N at position 3: \n- ""ALINE"": but A is not allowed.\n- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E -> no A, C, R. And N is not in this word? But we know the word must have an N. So we must include N.\n\nSo we need a word that has N at position 1, 2, or 3 and ends with E.\n\nLet me try to think of words with N at position 2: \n- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> no A, C, R. Good.\n\nWords with N at position 1: \n- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.\n\nWords with N at position 3: \n- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the end. So: \n  - ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nActually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So for position 3: \n- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)\n- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.\n- ""THINE"": same.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with N at position 3 and ending with E? Because in English, words with N at position 3 and then E at the end are rare? For example, ""AXINE"" is not common. \n\nBut let\'s consider: the secret word has E at position 5 and N somewhere (not at position 4). So the word might be like ""UNITE"", ""NOISE"", or ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E.\n\nAnother word: ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but that\'s 5 letters? I-N-L-E-T? No, that\'s 5: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> but we need E at position 5, so that\'s position 4 and 5? But we have E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So the word must have E at the fifth letter. So the fourth letter can be anything, and fifth is E.\n\nSo for position 3: \n- ""AXONE"": invalid (A)\n- ""PHONE"": N at 4 -> avoid.\n- ""THINE"": same.\n\nActually, I found: ""ANODE"": but A is not allowed.\n\n""AGONE"": A not allowed.\n\n""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E at position 1 and 5? And we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R. But ""EXILE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 1. However, we are not supposed to use E at position 1? We can use it, but we know that if the secret word has E at position 1, we\'ll get a check. But we don\'t know. Also, we are testing X, I, L.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""EXILE"" is acceptable? But it has two E\'s? That might be okay.\n\nBut let me check: ""EXILE"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have to consider: we know E is at position 5, so if we use E at position 1, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have E in the first position to avoid confusion? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word with N at position 3: \n- ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need E at position 5, so that\'s position 4 and 5. So we have E at 2 and N at 5. But we need E at 5, so that\'s fine. But we are putting E at position 2? We don\'t know if E is at position 2. Also, we are testing B, G, I.\n\nBut ""BEGIN"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, C, R. So ""BEGIN"" is acceptable.\n\nNow, let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: NOISE -> tests N at position 1, and O, I, S at positions 2,3,4.\nOption 2: UNITE -> tests U, I, T at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 2.\nOption 3: BEGIN -> tests B, G, I at positions 2,3,4 and N at position 5 (which is allowed, since we only know N is not at position 4).\n\nWe want to maximize information. We know the word has N and E. We are going to get feedback on the positions of N and E (we already know E is at 5, so we\'ll get a check for E). For N, we\'ll get feedback: if it\'s at the correct position, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if it\'s in the word but wrong position) or an x (if not in the word).\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it tests three new letters (O, I, S) at positions 2,3,4 and we know N is at 1. Also, if the secret word has O, I, S, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" tests U, I, T.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters. We might get more information.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check: is ""NOISE"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the forbidden letters (A, C, R). ""NOISE"" has N, O, I, S, E. No A, C, R. Good.\n\nSo my second guess is ""NOISE"".\n\nNow, I need to output it in the required format.\n\nBut first, let me think: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then ""UNITE"" would be a good choice because it has N at position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know. So we can choose either.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has E and N. We don\'t know about other vowels. We haven\'t tried O, I, U.\n\nIn ""NOISE"", we have O and I (vowels) and S (common consonant). In ""UNITE"", we have U and I (vowels) and T (common consonant).\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""NOISE"" for now.\n\nSo my second guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, A are not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not at position 4.\n- E is in the word and at position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include N (since it\'s in the word) but not at position 4.\n- Include E at position 5.\n- Avoid using C, R, A.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""NOISE"" because:\n- It places N at position 1 (a position we haven\'t tested for N) to see if N belongs there.\n- It tests three new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4) at positions 2,3,4.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, C, R) and uses no duplicates.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of O, I, S are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>NOISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\n- C, R, A are not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not at position 4.\n- E is in the word and at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)\n- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for N at position 1).\n- O is not in the word.\n- I is in the word but not at position 3.\n- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).\n- E is in the word and at position 5.\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has E at position 5 and S at position 4. So the word ends with ""ES"".\n2. The word contains N, but not at position 4 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess). So N must be at position 2 or 3.\n3. The word does not contain: C, R, A, O.\n\nWe also know that the first letter cannot be N (because of second guess) and cannot be C, R, A (from first guess).\n\nLet\'s list the known information:\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: E\n- N is in the word at position 2 or 3.\n- I is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we know position 4 is S, so I cannot be there either).\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Is a 5-letter word ending with ""ES"" (since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E).\n- Contains N (but not at position 4, and not at position 1, so only positions 2 or 3).\n- Contains I (but not at position 3).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, O.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for N:\n- We have two possibilities: position 2 or 3.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which one is correct. So we can try to cover both possibilities? However, we can only put N in one position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 2 and then other new letters, or in position 3 and other new letters.\n\nWe also need to include I (since it\'s in the word) and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with ""ES"" and have N and I.\n\nCommon words ending with ""ES"":\n- MINES\n- DINES\n- TINES\n- WINES\n- etc.\n\nBut we must avoid A, C, R, O.\n\nAlso, we know that I is in the word but not at position 3. So in our guess, we can put I in position 1,2,4? But position 4 is S, so I cannot be at position 4. So I can be at position 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, N must be at 2 or 3.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that has N at position 2 and I at position 1? Or position 2? Or position 1?\n\nWe can try:\n- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but we have I at position 1, N at position 2, and then L, E, T. But note: position 4 is S, so we have L at position 3 and E at 4? But we need E at position 5. So ""INLET"" ends with T, not E. So invalid.\n\nWe need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two are S and E.\n\nSo the word pattern: _ _ _ S E\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not C, R, A, O.\n\nWe also know that N is in the word at position 2 or 3.\n\nLet\'s try to put N at position 2 and I at position 1? Then we have: I N _ S E\n\nWhat can we put at position 3? It cannot be C, R, A, O. And we want to test new letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 3 and 5? But we know E is at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 3. However, we must avoid A, C, R, O. ""INES"" has E at position 3 and 5? But we don\'t know if E is at position 3. Also, we are testing E at position 3? But we already know E is at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use E again? The rules don\'t say we can\'t. But we know the word has at least one E (at position 5). It might have more.\n\nBut we are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid repeating E to test other letters.\n\nBut let\'s consider: if we put E at position 3, and the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.\n\nBut we are trying to find the first three letters.\n\nWe can try ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so the E at position 3 might be a duplicate? But the feedback will tell us.\n\nBut we are also testing I at position 1 and N at position 2.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, C, R, O.\n\n""INES"" has I, N, E, S, E. No A, C, R, O. Good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words.\n\nAnother word with N at position 2 and I at position 1: ""INLET"" is not valid because it ends with T, not E.\n\n""INES"" is valid.\n\nBut we can also try N at position 3.\n\nLet\'s try to put N at position 3: so pattern: _ _ N S E\n\nWhat words? \n- ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> ends with E? M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is E? But we know position 4 is S. So invalid.\n\n- ""DINES"": D, I, N, E, S -> same issue, position 4 is E, but we need S at position 4. So invalid.\n\n- ""TINES"": T, I, N, E, S -> same.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must be ? ? N S E.\n\nWhat words end with ""NS""? Not common. \n\nActually, words ending with ""NS"" are rare. \n\nLet me think of words with pattern _ _ N S E:\n- ""MINSE"": not a word.\n- ""DINSE"": not a word.\n- ""TINSE"": not a word.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. \n\nSo probably N is at position 2.\n\nTherefore, the word is likely I N ? S E, with ? being a letter that can form a word.\n\nSo words: \n- INANE: but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).\n- INLET: not ending with E.\n- INNES: not a word.\n- INOES: not a word.\n- INOES is not valid.\n\nValid words: \n- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but we have E at position 3 and 5. And we know E is at position 5, so if the word has E at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.\n\nBut we can also try ""INES"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother word: ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> ends with E? I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And no A, C, R, O. And it has I at position 1 and N at position 2.\n\nAnd we test U at position 3.\n\nBut we also have to consider that I is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I is at position 1 or not.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have I? But we know I is in the word, so we should include it to get information.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.\n\nWe know the word has N (at 2 or 3), I (somewhere not 3), S (at 4), E (at 5).\n\nSo the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] S E\n\nWith letter1, letter2, letter3 not being C, R, A, O.\n\nAnd we must include N and I (but I cannot be at position 3, which is already satisfied because in this pattern N is at 2 or 3, and I is at 1).\n\nSo let\'s go with ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E\n\nBut let me check if ""INES"" is valid: yes, it is.\n\nBut we have two E\'s. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don\'t know about other E\'s.\n\nIn ""INES"", we have E at position 3 and 5.\n\nIf the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.\n\nSimilarly, we test I at position 1 and N at position 2.\n\nBut we already know N is in the word, so if we put N at position 2 and it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at position 3) or x (if not at 2).\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nBut we also test E at position 3.\n\nBut we might get confused with two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.\n\nFor example, ""UNISE"": U, N, I, S, E -> but we have U, N, I, S, E. No A, C, R, O. And ends with E? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> yes! And I is at position 3? But in the feedback for guess 2, we know that I is not at position 3 (because in NOISE, I was at position 3 and got a minus). So we cannot put I at position 3.\n\nIn ""UNISE"", I is at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed because we know I is not at position 3.\n\nSo we must avoid putting I at position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our guess, I must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nSo let\'s try to put I at position 1 and N at position 2: I N ? S E\n\nWhat can we put at position 3? We need a letter that can form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""INES"": I, N, E, S, E -> but E at position 3 and 5.\n- ""INLET"": not ending with E.\n- ""INNED"": not a word.\n- ""INNED"" is not valid.\n- ""INNED"" is not valid.\n\nActually, ""INES"" is a word.\n\nAnother: ""INUES"": not common.\n\n""INES"" seems good.\n\nBut we have two E\'s. We might get feedback that E is at position 3? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without E at position 3.\n\nFor example, ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> but we have I at position 3? U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I at position 3, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we must avoid I at position 3.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern I N ? S E, the third letter must be something else.\n\nWhat about ""INUSE"": I, N, U, S, E -> I(1), N(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> I at 1, N at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5. And no A, C, R, O. And U is a new letter.\n\nSo ""INUSE"" is a valid word.\n\nWe can also consider ""INLET"" is not valid.\n\nAnother word: ""INNED"" is not valid.\n\nSo between ""INES"" and ""INUSE"", both are valid.\n\nBut ""INUSE"" avoids E at position 3, which might be better because we can test U without confusion.\n\nBut we are testing U at position 3.\n\nWe can also try a word that has N at position 3.\n\nLet me try to find a word with N at position 3: _ _ N S E\n\nWhat words? \n- ""MINSE"": not a word.\n- ""DINSE"": not a word.\n- ""TINSE"": not a word.\n- ""WINSE"": not a word.\n- ""PINSE"": not a word.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with the pattern _ _ N S E. \n\nSo probably N is at position 2.\n\nTherefore, I will go with ""INUSE"": to test I at position 1, N at position 2, and U at position 3.\n\nBut we also test E at position 3? But we know E is at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 3.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""INUSE"".\n\nBut note: we have two E\'s in ""INUSE"". The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don\'t know about other E\'s.\n\nIf the secret word has E at position 3, we get a check for E at position 3. If not, we get a minus.\n\nSimilarly, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then we know E is not at position 3.\n\nBut we are also testing U at position 3.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""INUSE"".\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\n""INUSE"" is a valid word (a biological term).\n\nSo my third guess is ""INUSE"".\n\nBut let me think: we have I at position 1, N at position 2, U at position 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe are testing I at 1, U at 3, and also we are confirming the position of N.\n\nBut we know N is in the word, so if we put it at 2 and it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus (if N is at 3) or x (if not at 2).\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nBut we also test U.\n\nSo let\'s output ""INUSE"".\n\nBut note: we have two E\'s. The feedback for the first guess showed E at position 5 is correct, but we don\'t know about position 3. So if we put E at position 3 and it\'s not in the word, we get an x.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for N at position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (since we got a minus for I at position 3).
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 3: INUSE -> I(-) N(-) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
- I is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for I at position 1).
- N is in the word but not at position 2 (since we got a minus for N at position 2).
- U is not in the word.
- S and E are correct at positions 4 and 5.

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
2. The word contains N and I (but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 for N and I respectively).
3. The word does not contain: C, R, A, O, U.

Also, note that the first letter cannot be N (from NOISE) and cannot be C, R, A, O, U (from other guesses).

We have two known letters: N and I, and we know they are in the word but not at the positions we tried.

Specifically:
- N is not at position 1 (from NOISE) and not at position 4 (from CRANE). So N must be at position 2 or 3.
- I is not at position 3 (from NOISE) and not at position 1 (from INUSE). So I must be at position 2 or 4.

But note: position 4 is S, so I cannot be at position 4. Therefore, I must be at position 2.

So now we know:
- Position 2: must be N or I? But wait, we have two letters to place: N and I. And we know I must be at position 2? Let me reconsider.

Actually, we know I is in the word and cannot be at position 3 (from NOISE) or position 1 (from INUSE). Therefore, the only positions left for I are 2 and 4. But position 4 is S, so I must be at position 2.

Similarly, N must be at position 2 or 3. But if I is at position 2, then N must be at position 3 (since position 4 is S and position 1 is not allowed for N).

So the word would be: _ I N S E

But let me confirm: 
- Position 2: I (because we deduced I must be at position 2)
- Position 3: N (since N must be at position 3, and position 4 is S)
- Position 4: S (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

So the word is: _ I N S E

But we also know that the first letter cannot be N (from NOISE) and cannot be C, R, A, O, U (from other guesses). Also, we have to avoid the letters we know are not present.

Now, what about the second letter? We haven't tested it yet. But we know that the second letter is not N (from NOISE) and not any of the forbidden letters.

But wait, we have a word: ""MINSE"" (if we allow S as a letter? But S is already at position 4, and we don't know if it can be repeated? The rules don't say anything against repeated letters, so we have to consider that possibility.

But note: in the feedback for CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In MINSE, we have N at position 3 and S at position 4. Since S is at position 4, that's consistent.

Similarly, in MINSE, the letters are M, I, N, S, E. We know S and E are at positions 4 and 5. I and N are at positions 2 and 3.

But we must check if MINSE is acceptable? It is a valid word.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words that fit the pattern.

But let me list the constraints again:
- First letter: not C, R, A, O, U, and not N (from NOISE). So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Second letter: must be I (because I must be at position 2, as deduced).
- Third letter: N (because N must be at position 3, since position 4 is S and position 1 is not allowed for N).
- Fourth letter: S (fixed)
- Fifth letter: E (fixed)

So the word is: [letter1] I N S E

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, O, U.

We also know that the first letter cannot be N (from NOISE) and cannot be any of the forbidden letters.

So possible words: 
- MINSE: M, I, N, S, E -> M is not forbidden, so valid.
- Other words? Like ""DINSE"", ""TINSE"", ""PINSE"", etc.

But let me check: 
- ""MINSE"" is a word (meaning: to reduce or diminish).
- ""DINSE"" (not common, but might be accepted? meaning: to diminish).
- ""TINSE"" (archaic, past tense of tinsel, but not common).
- ""PINSE"" (not common).

But note: we have to use only English words.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

But let's see: if we guess MINSE, we can get feedback on M and the positions of I and N.

But we are not sure if M is in the word? We haven't tested M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use S at position 3? But we know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 3, we might get feedback.

But note: we are trying to solve the puzzle. We have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.

But we can try to get more information.

But we know the word is _ I N S E. So we can try to guess one of these.

But we don't know the first letter.

We can try ""MINSE"" to test M.

But let me think: is there a word that uses more common letters? For example, T or L.

But T is common: ""TINSE"" (if accepted) or ""TINES"" (not common). 

But let's see: if we use T, we can test if T is the first letter.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

So possible words: 
- MINSE: M, I, N, S, E -> M is allowed.
- DINSE: D, I, N, S, E -> D is allowed.
- TINSE: T, I, N, S, E -> T is allowed.
- PINSE: P, I, N, S, E -> P is allowed.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

We also have other possibilities: 
- ""WINSE"" (not common) -> W, I, N, S, E -> W is allowed.
- ""LINSE"" (not common) -> L, I, N, S, E -> L is allowed.

But let's stick to common words.

We can try ""MINSE"" to test M.

But we are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess.

But note: if we guess MINSE and it's not the word, we get feedback on M and the positions of I and N.

But we already know that I is at position 2 and N at position 3? Not necessarily: we deduced that I must be at position 2 and N at position 3? But wait, we haven't tested position 2 and 3 for I and N.

In MINSE, we are putting I at position 2 and N at position 3. But we haven't tested these positions.

So let's go with MINSE.

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 3? But we know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 3, we might get feedback.

But we are trying to solve the puzzle. We have three positions fixed: 2:I, 3:N, 4:S, 5:E. So we only need to find the first letter.

So we can guess one of the candidate words.

But let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, O, U.

So first letter: must be a letter not in {C, R, A, O, U} and not N (from NOISE).

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, words: 
- MINSE: M, I, N, S, E -> M is allowed.
- DINSE: D, I, N, S, E -> D is allowed.
- TINSE: T, I, N, S, E -> T is allowed.
- PINSE: P, I, N, S, E -> P is allowed.
- WINSE: W, I, N, S, E -> W is allowed.
- LINSE: L, I, N, S, E -> L is allowed.

Also, ""BINS E"" is not a word.

""KINS E"" not a word.

So possible words: MINSE, DINSE, TINSE, PINSE, WINSE, LINSE.

But note: we have to make sure the word is in the word list.

We can choose the most common word: ""MINSE"" or ""DINSE"".

But let's see: we have to avoid using forbidden letters.

We are going to guess ""MINSE"" to test M.

If we guess MINSE and it's not the word, we get feedback on M and the positions of I and N.

But we already know that I is at position 2 and N at position 3? Not necessarily: we haven't tested position 2 and 3 for I and N.

In MINSE, we are putting I at position 2 and N at position 3. But we haven't tested I at position 2 or N at position 3.

So if we guess MINSE, the feedback will tell us:
- M at position 1: if correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if M is in the word but wrong position) or x (if not in the word).
- I at position 2: we know I is in the word, but is it at position 2? We haven't tested it.
- N at position 3: similarly, we haven't tested it.

But we are also testing the positions.

So let's go with ""MINSE"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

So my fourth guess is ""MINSE"".

But let me think: we have the pattern _ I N S E. We know the word must be one of these.

So I'll guess ""MINSE"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. MINSE has M, I, N, S, E. No forbidden letters. Good.

So <guess>MINSE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- The secret word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
- The word contains N and I, but not at the positions previously tried:
  - N cannot be at position 1 (from NOISE) or position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
  - I cannot be at position 3 (from NOISE) or position 1 (from INUSE), so it must be at position 2 or 4. However, position 4 is S, so I must be at position 2.
- Therefore, the word is _ I N S E.

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O, U.

For the fourth guess, I need to test the first letter while confirming the positions of I and N.

I chose ""MINSE"" because:
- It tests M at position 1 (a new letter).
- It keeps the known E at position 5 and S at position 4.
- It places I at position 2 (which we deduced must be correct) and N at position 3 (which we deduced must be correct, but we haven't tested them there).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, O, U).

This guess will help identify the first letter and confirm the positions of I and N.

<guess>MINSE</guess>",MINSE,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(-) S(✓) E(✓)
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for N at position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (since we got a minus for I at position 3).
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is in the word and at position 5.

Guess 3: INUSE -> I(-) N(-) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
- I is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for I at position 1).
- N is in the word but not at position 2 (since we got a minus for N at position 2).
- U is not in the word.
- S and E are correct at positions 4 and 5.

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
2. The word contains N and I (but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 for N and I respectively).
3. The word does not contain: C, R, A, O, U.

Also, note that the first letter cannot be N (from NOISE) and cannot be C, R, A, O, U (from other guesses).

We have two known letters: N and I, and we know they are in the word but not at the positions we tried.

Specifically:
- N is not at position 1 (from NOISE) and not at position 4 (from CRANE). So N must be at position 2 or 3.
- I is not at position 3 (from NOISE) and not at position 1 (from INUSE). So I must be at position 2 or 4.

But note: position 4 is S, so I cannot be at position 4. Therefore, I must be at position 2.

So now we know:
- Position 2: must be N or I? But wait, we have two letters to place: N and I. And we know I must be at position 2? Let me reconsider.

Actually, we know I is in the word and cannot be at position 3 (from NOISE) or position 1 (from INUSE). Therefore, the only positions left for I are 2 and 4. But position 4 is S, so I must be at position 2.

Similarly, N must be at position 2 or 3. But if I is at position 2, then N must be at position 3 (since position 4 is S and position 1 is not allowed for N).

So the word would be: _ I N S E

But let me confirm: 
- Position 2: I (because we deduced I must be at position 2)
- Position 3: N (since N must be at position 3, and position 4 is S)
- Position 4: S (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

So the word is: _ I N S E

But we also know that the first letter cannot be N (from NOISE) and cannot be C, R, A, O, U (from other guesses). Also, we have to avoid the letters we know are not present.

Now, what about the second letter? We haven't tested it yet. But we know that the second letter is not N (from NOISE) and not any of the forbidden letters.

But wait, we have a word: ""MINSE"" (if we allow S as a letter? But S is already at position 4, and we don't know if it can be repeated? The rules don't say anything against repeated letters, so we have to consider that possibility.

But note: in the feedback for CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In MINSE, we have N at position 3 and S at position 4. Since S is at position 4, that's consistent.

Similarly, in MINSE, the letters are M, I, N, S, E. We know S and E are at positions 4 and 5. I and N are at positions 2 and 3.

But we must check if MINSE is acceptable? It is a valid word.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words that fit the pattern.

But let me list the constraints again:
- First letter: not C, R, A, O, U, and not N (from NOISE). So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Second letter: must be I (because I must be at position 2, as deduced).
- Third letter: N (because N must be at position 3, since position 4 is S and position 1 is not allowed for N).
- Fourth letter: S (fixed)
- Fifth letter: E (fixed)

So the word is: [letter1] I N S E

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, O, U.

We also know that the first letter cannot be N (from NOISE) and cannot be any of the forbidden letters.

So possible words: 
- MINSE: M, I, N, S, E -> M is not forbidden, so valid.

But note: we are trying to solve the puzzle. We have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.

But we can try to get more information.

But we know the word is _ I N S E. So we can try to guess one of these.

But we don't know the first letter.

We can try ""MINSE"" to test M.

But let me think: is there a word that uses more common letters? For example, T or L.

But T is common: ""TINSE"" (if accepted) or ""TINES"" (not common). 

But let's see: if we use T, we can test if T is the first letter.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

So possible words: 
- MINSE: M, I, N, S, E -> M is allowed.
- DINSE: D, I, N, S, E -> D is allowed.
- TINSE: T, I, N, S, E -> T is allowed.
- PINSE: P, I, N, S, E -> P is allowed.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

We also have other possibilities: 
- ""WINSE"" (not common) -> W, I, N, S, E -> W is allowed.
- ""LINSE"" (not common) -> L, I, N, S, E -> L is allowed.

But let's stick to common words.

We can try ""MINSE"" to test M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 3? But we know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 3, we might get feedback.

But we are trying to solve the puzzle. We have three positions fixed: 2:I, 3:N, 4:S, 5:E. So we only need to find the first letter.

So we can guess one of the candidate words.

But let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, O, U.

So first letter: must be a letter not in {C, R, A, O, U} and not N (from NOISE).

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, words: 
- MINSE: M, I, N, S, E -> M is allowed.
- DINSE: D, I, N, S, E -> D is allowed.
- TINSE: T, I, N, S, E -> T is allowed.
- PINSE: P, I, N, S, E -> P is allowed.
- WINSE: W, I, N, S, E -> W is allowed.
- LINSE: L, I, N, S, E -> L is allowed.

Also, ""BINS E"" is not a word.

""KINS E"" not a word.

So possible words: MINSE, DINSE, TINSE, PINSE, WINSE, LINSE.

But note: we have to make sure the word is in the word list.

We can choose the most common word: ""MINSE"" or ""DINSE"".

But let's see: we have to avoid using forbidden letters.

We are going to guess ""MINSE"" to test M.

If we guess MINSE and it's not the word, we get feedback on M and the positions of I and N.

But we already know that I is at position 2 and N at position 3? Not necessarily: we haven't tested position 2 and 3 for I and N.

In MINSE, we are putting I at position 2 and N at position 3. But we haven't tested I at position 2 or N at position 3.

- M at position 1: if correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (if M is in the word but wrong position) or x (if not in the word).
- I at position 2: we know I is in the word, but is it at position 2? We haven't tested it.
- N at position 3: similarly, we haven't tested it.

But we are also testing the positions.

So let's go with ""MINSE"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

So my fourth guess is ""MINSE"".

But let me think: we have the pattern _ I N S E. We know the word must be one of these.

So I'll guess ""MINSE"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. MINSE has M, I, N, S, E. No forbidden letters. Good.

So <guess>MINSE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- The secret word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are S and E).
- The word contains N and I, but not at the positions previously tried:
  - N cannot be at position 1 (from NOISE) or position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be at position 2 or 3.
  - I cannot be at position 3 (from NOISE) or position 1 (from INUSE), so it must be at position 2 or 4. However, position 4 is S, so I must be at position 2.
- Therefore, the word is _ I N S E.

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O, U.

For the fourth guess, I need to test the first letter while confirming the positions of I and N.

I chose ""MINSE"" because:
- It tests M at position 1 (a new letter).
- It keeps the known E at position 5 and S at position 4.
- It places I at position 2 (which we deduced must be correct) and N at position 3 (which we deduced must be correct, but we haven't tested them there).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, O, U).

This guess will help identify the first letter and confirm the positions of I and N.",Guess 4: MINSE -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
