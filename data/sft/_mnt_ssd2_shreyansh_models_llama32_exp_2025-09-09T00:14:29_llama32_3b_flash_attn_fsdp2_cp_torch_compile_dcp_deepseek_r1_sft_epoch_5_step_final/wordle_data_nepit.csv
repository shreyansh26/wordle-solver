### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:

E (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.

So, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.

But ""CRANE"" is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

It's a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

""CRANE"" has E (1st), A (2nd), R (3rd), N (4th), E (5th) – wait, ""CRANE"" has two E's? No, ""CRANE"" is C-R-A-N-E, so E is at the end, but it's the same letter. Actually, ""CRANE"" has E in the 5th position, which is the same as E in ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". But for the first guess, it doesn't matter as long as there's E somewhere.

But ""CRANE"" does not have repeated letters: C, R, A, N, E – all distinct.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – all distinct.

""ROATE"" is not a word; ""ROATE"" isn't standard. ""ROATE"" might be a variant, but I should stick with common words.

""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" is good.

I recall that in Wordle, ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

But let me confirm: is there a better starting word?

""ADIEU"" has many vowels but lacks common consonants, so it might not be as balanced. Vowels are important, but consonants like R, S, T are equally common.

""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E – that's a good mix.

""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E – also good.

""CRANE"" is fine.

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess>
</think>
First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word with E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, or a mix that includes vowels and consonants.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has E (1st), A (2nd), R (3rd), N (4th), E (5th) – wait, ""CRANE"" has two E's? No, ""CRANE"" is C-R-A-N-E, so E is at the end, but it's the same letter. Actually, ""CRANE"" has E in position 5, which is the same as E in ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". But for the first guess, it doesn't matter as long as there's E somewhere.

But ""CRANE"" does not have repeated letters: C, R, A, N, E – all distinct.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – all distinct.

""ROATE"" is not a word; ""ROATE"" isn't standard. ""ROATE"" might be a variant, but I should stick with common words.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:

E (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.

So, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.

But ""CRANE"" is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

It's a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.\n\nIn English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter and E was the 5th).

Therefore, the secret word contains N and E, but not C, R, or A.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)
- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

But note: the feedback for E is a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. Similarly for N, it is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put N and E in different positions to test where they might be.

We also want to avoid using C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters.

For example, we know N is not in position 4. So we can try N in position 1, 2, or 3.
Similarly, E is not in position 5, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (N and E) and we want to test their positions. We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Possible words: 
- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.
- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.
- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.

But note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.

I think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new letter)
- P at position 2 (new letter)
- I at position 3 (new letter)
- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.

So let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"":
- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a '-' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won't get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.

So let's avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.

Another word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. 
- N is in 2nd position (new position)
- E is in 4th position (we haven't tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)
- Avoids C, R, A.

Also, we get to test I, L, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.

But let's stick to words without repeats for now.

Another word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E's.

""INLET"" seems good: 
- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.

But let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.

We are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.

Alternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T's? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don't know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T's? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T's. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.

But note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing new positions.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. 
- U is a new letter
- N in 2nd (new position)
- S in 3rd (new)
- E in 4th (new position for E)
- T in 5th (new)

This tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.

But we don't know if the word has U, S, T.

I think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

So ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.

Similarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that's okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.

But we are not putting E in 5th, so that's fine.

However, we are putting T in 5th. We don't know about T.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.

So I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.

But let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.

So I'll go with ""UNSET"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn't have them.

So second guess: ""UNSET""

But note: we are putting N in the second position. We don't know if that's correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried, and also test more common letters.

Another word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. 
- S at 1st
- T at 2nd
- O at 3rd
- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.

Similarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.

So let's stick with ""UNSET"".

But note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven't tested N in second or E in fourth.

We also get to test U, S, T.

So I think that's a good choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in the 4th position.
- E is present but not in the 5th position.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).
2. Exclude C, R, A.
3. Test new letters to gather more information.
4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).

I considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E. Additionally, it tests three new common letters: U, S, T.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:

E (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.

So, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.

But ""CRANE"" is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

It's a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter and E was the 5th).

Therefore, the secret word contains N and E, but not C, R, or A.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)
- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

But note: the feedback for E is a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. Similarly for N, it is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put N and E in different positions to test where they might be.

We also want to avoid using C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters.

For example, we know N is not in position 4. So we can try N in position 1, 2, or 3.
Similarly, E is not in position 5, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (N and E) and we want to test their positions. We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Possible words: 
- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.
- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.
- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.

But note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.

I think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new letter)
- P at position 2 (new letter)
- I at position 3 (new letter)
- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.

So let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"":
- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a '-' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won't get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.

So let's avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.

Another word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. 
- N is in 2nd position (new position)
- E is in 4th position (we haven't tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)
- Avoids C, R, A.

Also, we get to test I, L, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.

But let's stick to words without repeats for now.

Another word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E's.

""INLET"" seems good: 
- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.

But let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.

We are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.

Alternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T's? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don't know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T's? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T's. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.

But note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing new positions.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. 
- U is a new letter
- N in 2nd (new position)
- S in 3rd (new)
- E in 4th (new position for E)
- T in 5th (new)

This tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.

But we don't know if the word has U, S, T.

I think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

So ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.

Similarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that's okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.

But we are not putting E in 5th, so that's fine.

However, we are putting T in 5th. We don't know about T.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.

So I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.

But let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.

So I'll go with ""UNSET"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn't have them.

So second guess: ""UNSET""

But note: we are putting N in the second position. We don't know if that's correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried, and also test more common letters.

Another word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. 
- S at 1st
- T at 2nd
- O at 3rd
- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.

Similarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.

So let's stick with ""UNSET"".

But note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven't tested N in second or E in fourth.

We also get to test U, S, T.

So I think that's a good choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in the 4th position.
- E is present but not in the 5th position.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).
2. Exclude C, R, A.
3. Test new letters to gather more information.
4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).

I considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E. Additionally, it tests three new common letters: U, S, T.

I should aim for a word that includes several of these.\n\nA good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities.

So, I\'ll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.\n\nPopular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.\n\n""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nBut I should consider letter frequency.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: UNSET -> U(x), N(-), S(x), E(-), T(✓)
Meaning:
- U and S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed it in the 2nd and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E is in the word but not in the 4th position (we guessed it in the 4th and got '-'), and T is in the word and in the 5th position (we guessed it in the 5th and got '✓', meaning correct position).
- T is in the word and is the 5th letter.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters N and E (but not in the positions we guessed).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S.
3. T is in the word and is the 5th letter, so the word ends with T.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ T

Also, N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Since the word has 5 letters and the last is T, N must be in one of the first three positions.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 4th position. Since the word ends with T, E must be in one of the first three positions.

But note: we have two letters that must be in the word: N and E. And we know they are not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (for N) and (E is fixed at the end so it's not in 4th for E, but we already know E isn't in 5th from the first guess).

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with T (since we know T is in the 5th position and we want to test other positions).
- Includes N and E (but we know E is at the end, so we can put N in one of the first three positions and E in one of the first three positions, but avoiding the positions we know are wrong for each).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, U, S (since they are absent).
- Tests new letters to get more information.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have three positions to fill (1,2,3) but note that the last is fixed as T.

So the word: [letter1][letter2][letter3] T

We know letter1, letter2, letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, A, U, S and including N and E? Not necessarily, but we know N and E are in the word, but they might be in other positions? Actually, we know N is not in 4th, but it could be in 1st,2nd, or 3rd. Similarly, E is not in 5th, so it could be in 1st,2nd, or 3rd.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) that must be in the word, but they might be in the positions we haven't tried? Actually, we haven't tested positions 1,2,3 for N and E? Actually, in the first guess, we had N in 4th and E in 5th. In the second guess, we had N in 2nd and E in 4th. So for N, we know it's not in 2nd or 4th. For E, we know it's not in 5th, but we haven't tested 1st,2nd,3rd.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

So, for the third guess, we can try to put N and E in positions that we haven't eliminated for them, and also test new letters.

We have two known letters (N and E) that must be placed in positions 1,2,3, but note that position 4 and 5 are fixed as T. So we have to choose positions 1,2,3.

We know N is not in 2nd or 4th. So N must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But position 5 is T, so N cannot be in 5th. Therefore, N must be in 1st or 3rd.

Similarly, E is not in 4th (which we know because we put E in 4th and got '-', meaning it's present but not there) and not in 5th (which we know because of the first guess). So E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

But note: we have two letters to place (N and E) in three positions, but we also have to consider that the word might have other letters.

We should try to cover more common letters. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T (but T is already fixed at the end), V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know T is at the end, so we can use that to our advantage.

We can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

For example, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or N in the third and E in the second? etc.

But note: we must avoid using C, R, A, U, S.

Let me think of words that end with T and have N and E in the first three positions, without C, R, A, U, S.

Possible words:

- ""INLET"": I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T -> but we know E is not in 4th? So if we put E in 4th, we will get a '-' for E (if the word has E) and we won't know if E is in 4th? Actually, we know E is not in 4th from the second guess? Wait, no: in the second guess, we put E in 4th and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in 4th. So we should avoid putting E in 4th.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 2nd and 4th.

So for ""INLET"", E is in 4th, which we know is wrong? So we should avoid that.

Alternatively, we can try ""ENTIT"": E-N-T-I-T -> but has two T's? And it's 5 letters? Actually, ""ENTIT"" is 5 letters? E-N-T-I-T -> positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:T -> but we have T in 3rd and 5th? And we know T is at the end, but we don't know if there is another T? The feedback for T was only for the 5th position, so there might be another T? But we don't know.

But note: we are allowed to use T again? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't forbid it. But we should be cautious.

However, we know T is in the word and at the end. We don't know if there are other T's.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""INLET"" is invalid because of E in 4th.

What about ""NEEDY"": N-E-E-D-Y -> has two E's? And E is in 2nd and 4th? We know E is not in 4th, so the E in 4th would be wrong? And the E in 2nd might be correct? But we don't know. Also, we are testing D and Y.

But we have two E's? It might be confusing.

Alternatively, ""LEANT"": L-E-A-N-T -> but A is absent (from first guess) -> invalid.

""INLET"" is invalid.

""ONSET"": O-N-S-E-T -> but S is absent -> invalid.

""UNTIL"": U-N-T-I-L -> U is absent -> invalid.

""INERT"": I-N-E-R-T -> R is absent -> invalid.

""ENTER"": E-N-T-E-R -> R is absent -> invalid.

""INLET"" and ""ENTER"" are out.

""ONSET"" and ""ENTER"" are out.

""INERT"" and ""ENTER"" are out.

Let me think of words that have N and E and end with T, without the forbidden letters.

Common words: ""INSET"" -> I-N-S-E-T -> but S is absent -> invalid.

""INLET"" is invalid.

""OUTER"": O-U-T-T-E-R -> U is absent and R is absent -> invalid.

""INSET"" is invalid.

""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> U is absent -> invalid.

""ENACT"": E-N-A-C-T -> A and C are absent -> invalid.

""INACT"": not a word.

""ONCET"": not a word.

""ENTIT"": E-N-T-I-T -> has two T's? And I and T are new.

But let's consider: we know T is at the end, so if we use ""ENTIT"", we have T in 3rd and 5th. The feedback for T in the 5th will be ✓. The T in 3rd: if the word has a T in 3rd, we'll get a ✓ or - for that position? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have T in the middle? But we don't know if there is a T in the middle.

We can try to use a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested and also tests new letters.

Let me try to list words ending with T that have N and E and no C, R, A, U, S.

Possible words:

- ""MINT"": 4 letters? No, 5 letters: M-I-N-T -> but that's M-I-N-T, so positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T? But we need the last letter to be T? No, the last letter is T, so the word must be ...T.

So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3]T

So ""MINT"" is 4 letters? No: M-I-N-T is 4 letters? Wait, no: M-I-N-T is 4 letters? Actually, ""MINT"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: ""MINTS"" -> but ends with S, not T.

""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> but R is absent -> invalid.

""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> has O, I, N, T. But note: the last letter is T, so the word is J-O-I-N-T. Positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T.

Now, check against feedback:
- We know N is in the word, but not in 4th? In ""JOINT"", N is in 4th. We know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in 4th, and from the second guess that N is not in 2nd. So in ""JOINT"", we are putting N in 4th, which we know is wrong? So we will get a '-' for N? But that doesn't give new information? We already know N is in the word and not in 4th. So we should avoid putting N in 4th.

Similarly, in ""JOINT"", N is in 4th, so we should avoid.

We need a word that has N in 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But 5th is T, so only 1st or 3rd.

Similarly, E must be in 1st,2nd, or 3rd.

So let's try to find a word that has N in 1st or 3rd, E in 1st,2nd, or 3rd, and the last letter T.

And without C, R, A, U, S.

Possible words:

- ""ENTIT"": E-N-T-I-T -> positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:T -> has two T's? And we are testing I and T (but T is already known? Actually, we are testing if there is a T in the 3rd? And also, we are testing I and the second T? But we don't know if the word has two T's? It might be acceptable? But let's see.

But note: we are trying to get information. If we use ""ENTIT"", we are testing:
- E in 1st: if E is in 1st, we get ✓, else if N is in 1st, we get ✓, etc.

But we are also testing I and the second T.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEIST"" (a word? meaning a narrow inlet) -> N-E-I-S-T -> but S is absent -> invalid.

""NEIST"" is not common.

""INLET"" is invalid.

""ONSET"" and ""ENTER"" are out.

""INERT"" is out.

""ONCET"" not a word.

""INSET"" is invalid.

""UNLIT"" invalid.

""ENACT"" invalid.

""INACT"" not a word.

""LEANT"" invalid because of A.

""MEANT"": M-E-A-N-T -> A is absent -> invalid.

""BEANT"": not a word.

""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T -> A absent -> invalid.

""DELFT"": D-E-L-F-T -> ends with T? D-E-L-F-T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:L, 4:F, 5:T -> and no A, C, R, U, S. So this is a candidate.

But note: we are testing D, E, L, F.

But we know E is in the word, so we are testing D, L, F.

Similarly, ""DELFT"" tests D, L, F.

But we don't know if the word has L or F.

Another word: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""OUTET"" not a word.

""INLET"" invalid.

""ONNIT"": O-N-N-I-T -> has two N's? And ends with T? O-N-N-I-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:N, 4:I, 5:T -> again two N's? And we don't know if the word has two N's? Also, we are testing O and I.

But we have two N's? We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? It might.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""ONNIT"" is not a common word.

""INNIT"": not a word.

""ONCET"" not a word.

""INSET"" invalid.

""UNLIT"" invalid.

""ENACT"" invalid.

""INACT"" invalid.

""ONCET"" not a word.

""INSET"" and ""ONSET"" are out.

""INLET"" invalid.

""OUTET"" not a word.

""INNIT"" not a word.

""INERT"" and ""ENTER"" are out.

""INLIT"": I-N-L-I-T -> has two I's? And ends with T? I-N-L-I-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T -> again two I's? And we are testing I and L.

But we have two I's? We don't know if the word has two I's? It might.

But let's try to find a word with distinct letters.

""DELFT"": D-E-L-F-T -> distinct letters: D, E, L, F, T. We know E is in the word, so we are testing D, L, F.

Similarly, ""MEANT"" invalid.

""BEVET"" not a word.

""DEPOT"": D-E-P-O-T -> ends with T? D-E-P-O-T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:P, 4:O, 5:T -> and no A, C, R, U, S. So this is a candidate.

""DEPOT"" tests D, E, P, O.

We know E is in the word, so we are testing P and O.

Similarly, ""DELFT"" tests D, E, L, F.

We can also try ""NEIST"" (if accepted) or ""NEIST"" is not common.

""INNIT"" not a word.

""ONNIT"" not a word.

""ONCET"" not a word.

""INSET"" invalid.

""UNLIT"" invalid.

""ENACT"" invalid.

""INACT"" invalid.

""ONCET"" not a word.

""INSET"" and ""ONSET"" are out.

""INLET"" invalid.

""OUTET"" not a word.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 08 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:

E (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.

So, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.

But ""CRANE"" is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

It's a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter and E was the 5th).

Therefore, the secret word contains N and E, but not C, R, or A.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)
- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

But note: the feedback for E is a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. Similarly for N, it is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put N and E in different positions to test where they might be.

We also want to avoid using C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters.

For example, we know N is not in position 4. So we can try N in position 1, 2, or 3.
Similarly, E is not in position 5, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (N and E) and we want to test their positions. We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Possible words: 
- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.
- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.
- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.

But note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.

I think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new letter)
- P at position 2 (new letter)
- I at position 3 (new letter)
- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.

So let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"":
- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a '-' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won't get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.

So let's avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.

Another word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. 
- N is in 2nd position (new position)
- E is in 4th position (we haven't tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)
- Avoids C, R, A.

Also, we get to test I, L, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.

But let's stick to words without repeats for now.

Another word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E's.

""INLET"" seems good: 
- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.

But let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.

We are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.

Alternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T's? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don't know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T's? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T's. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.

But note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing new positions.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. 
- U is a new letter
- N in 2nd (new position)
- S in 3rd (new)
- E in 4th (new position for E)
- T in 5th (new)

This tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.

But we don't know if the word has U, S, T.

I think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

So ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.

Similarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that's okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.

But we are not putting E in 5th, so that's fine.

However, we are putting T in 5th. We don't know about T.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.

So I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.

But let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.

So I'll go with ""UNSET"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn't have them.

So second guess: ""UNSET""

But note: we are putting N in the second position. We don't know if that's correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried, and also test more common letters.

Another word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. 
- S at 1st
- T at 2nd
- O at 3rd
- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.

Similarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.

So let's stick with ""UNSET"".

But note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven't tested N in second or E in fourth.

We also get to test U, S, T.

So I think that's a good choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in the 4th position.
- E is present but not in the 5th position.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).
2. Exclude C, R, A.
3. Test new letters to gather more information.
4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).

I considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E. Additionally, it tests three new common letters: U, S, T.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.\n\nIn English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.\n\nA good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I\'ll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.\n\nPopular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.\n\n""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nBut I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that\'s 5/5th most common to 1st?

Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.\n\nPerhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.\n\nBut ""CRANE"" is fine.

We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)\n- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)\n- Includes other common letters to test for presence.\n\nWe also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Here E is in 4th, so that\'s okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: UNSET -> U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- U and S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed N in the 2nd and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E is in the word but not in the 4th position (we guessed E in the 4th and got '-'), and we already knew E is not in the 5th.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (4th position, since T is the 4th letter in ""UNSET"").

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions we guessed (N not in 4th, E not in 5th; specifically for E, not in 4th? Actually, we only know E is not in 5th from the first guess, but also not in 4th from the second).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S (all marked 'x').
- T is in the word and is in the 4th position.

Therefore, the secret word has the following structure:
- The 4th letter is T.
- The word contains N and E, but not in the positions we've tried (so N is not in 2nd or 4th, E is not in 4th or 5th).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has T in the 4th position (since we know it's correct and we can use that to test other letters).
- Includes N and E, but in positions we haven't ruled out (so N can be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th; E in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, U, S (and also we know the positions for N and E are not the ones we tried).
- Tests new letters to get more information.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have T in the 4th position and include N and E.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 3rd, 5th (since 2nd and 4th are invalid).
Possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th and 5th are invalid).

We should also try to cover more common letters that we haven't tested yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using C, R, A, U, S.

Let's try to form a word that has T in the 4th position, and includes N and E in positions we haven't tried, and also tests new letters.

For example, we can try:

- Position 1: N? Then we have: N _ _ T _
- Or position 3: N? Then: _ _ N T _
- Or position 5: N? Then: _ _ _ T N

Similarly for E.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: Start with N in 1st and E in 2nd? Then the word would be: N E _ T _
We need to fill the last two positions with new letters (avoiding C,R,A,U,S) and we must include E? Actually, we already have E in 2nd, but we are testing.

But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? But we only know one E is present (from the first guess) and it was in 5th, so now we are putting it in 2nd. Similarly for N.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same position as before? We have already tried N in 4th and E in 5th, and they were present but wrong position, so now we avoid those.

Let me try to find a word with T in the 4th position, and N and E in positions 1, 3, or 5, and E in 1,2,3.

Example: ""INLET"" was considered earlier, but it has I and L and T. However, in ""INLET"", T is in 4th? Let's check: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. But wait, we know T is in the 4th position? No, in ""INLET"", T is in 5th? So that doesn't have T in 4th.

We need T in the 4th position.

So the word must be: ? ? ? T ?

And it must contain N and E, and not contain C,R,A,U,S.

Let me try to think of words ending with T? But the T is in the 4th, so the last letter is something else.

Words with T in the 4th position: 
- The pattern is: ? ? ? T ?

For example: ""FAINT"" -> F-A-I-N-T: T is in 5th? No, the 4th letter is N? So we need the 4th letter to be T.

So: 
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: ?

And the word must contain N and E.

So: 
- E could be in position 1? Then: E ? ? T ?
- Or E in position 2: ? E ? T ?
- Or E in position 3: ? ? E T ?

Similarly for N: 
- N in position 1: N ? ? T ?
- N in position 3: ? ? N T ?
- N in position 5: ? ? ? T N

But note: we also have to avoid the letters C,R,A,U,S.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option: N in 1st and E in 2nd: N E ? T ? 
We need two more letters, avoiding C,R,A,U,S.

Examples: ""NEWT"" (but W is new, and we have E in 2nd and T in 4th? ""NEWT"": N-E-W-T -> positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:W, 4:T, 5:S -> but S is forbidden (we know S is not in the word). So invalid.

""NEED"": N-E-E-D -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? Also, we are putting E in 2nd and 3rd? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? However, we should avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information? But if we have to, it's okay.

But note: we are allowed to use repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't. But in the example, they didn't repeat. However, the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

But to maximize information, we should try to use distinct letters if possible.

So ""NEED"" has two E's? So we are testing E in 2nd and 3rd? But we already know E is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for one of them, we know the position. But if we get a '-' for both, we know there are two E's? But we don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeated letters.

Another word: ""NEIST"" (a word? meaning a unit of weight or currency) -> N-E-I-S-T: but S is forbidden -> invalid.

""NIGHT"": N-I-G-H-T -> T is in 5th? No.

We need T in 4th.

""ENTER"": E-N-T-E-R -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""INLET"" doesn't have T in 4th.

Let me think of words that end with ""T"" is not the case. The T is in the 4th position, so the last letter is something else.

Examples: 
- ""BEAUT"": not a word? 
- ""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T -> but A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""FELT"": F-E-L-T -> T is in 4th? F(1), E(2), L(3), T(4),? -> wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:F, 2:E, 3:L, 4:T, 5:?

So the word would be: ? ? ? T ?

With N and E in the remaining positions.

For example: 
- ""MINTY"": M-I-N-T-Y -> T is in 4th? M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). And it has M, I, N, T, Y. But note: we are putting N in 3rd? That's allowed. And E is not in 5th? We are not putting E in 5th. So that's okay.

But we must check if the letters are allowed: M, I, N, T, Y. We haven't used M, I, Y. And we avoid C,R,A,U,S. So M, I, Y are new.

But note: we are testing N in 3rd? We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another word: ""DENT"": too short.

""INERT"": I-N-E-R-T -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""ONSET"": O-N-S-E-T -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.

""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> but U is forbidden -> invalid.

""ANVIL"": A-N-V-I-L -> A is forbidden -> invalid.

""ENTIT"": not a common word.

""INNED"": I-N-N-E-D -> has two N's? And E in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So invalid.

""INLET"" doesn't have T in 4th.

Let me think of words that have T in the 4th position and E and N.

Another idea: ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.

""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> R is forbidden -> invalid.

""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> T is in 5th? No.

We need the 4th letter to be T.

So: 
- Position 1: any letter (not C,R,A,U,S)
- Position 2: any letter (not C,R,A,U,S)
- Position 3: any letter (not C,R,A,U,S)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: any letter (not C,R,A,U,S)

And the word must contain N and E.

So: 
- E in 1st: E ? ? T ? 
  Examples: ""EJECT"" -> E-J-E-C-T -> has C and two E's? C is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""EJECT"" has C -> invalid.

  ""EJECT"" is invalid.

  ""ELINT"": E-L-I-N-T -> T is in 5th? No.

  ""EJECT"" is out.

  ""ENTER"": E-N-T-E-R -> has R -> invalid.

  ""EJECT"" is out.

  ""EJECT"" is out.

  ""ELINT"" doesn't have T in 4th.

  ""EVENT"": E-V-E-N-T -> T is in 5th? No.

  ""EVENT"" doesn't have T in 4th.

  ""EJECT"" doesn't work.

  ""ELINT"" doesn't work.

  ""ENACT"": E-N-A-C-T -> has A and C -> invalid.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 08 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:

E (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.

So, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.

But ""CRANE"" is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

It's a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter and E was the 5th).

Therefore, the secret word contains N and E, but not C, R, or A.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)
- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

But note: the feedback for E is a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. Similarly for N, it is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put N and E in different positions to test where they might be.

We also want to avoid using C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters.

For example, we know N is not in position 4. So we can try N in position 1, 2, or 3.
Similarly, E is not in position 5, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (N and E) and we want to test their positions. We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Possible words: 
- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.
- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.
- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.

But note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.

I think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new letter)
- P at position 2 (new letter)
- I at position 3 (new letter)
- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.

So let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"":
- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a '-' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won't get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.

So let's avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.

Another word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. 
- N is in 2nd position (new position)
- E is in 4th position (we haven't tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)
- Avoids C, R, A.

Also, we get to test I, L, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.

But let's stick to words without repeats for now.

Another word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E's.

""INLET"" seems good: 
- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.

But let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.

We are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.

Alternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T's? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don't know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T's? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T's. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.

But note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing new positions.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. 
- U is a new letter
- N in 2nd (new position)
- S in 3rd (new)
- E in 4th (new position for E)
- T in 5th (new)

This tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.

But we don't know if the word has U, S, T.

I think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

So ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.

Similarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that's okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.

But we are not putting E in 5th, so that's fine.

However, we are putting T in 5th. We don't know about T.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.

So I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.

But let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.

So I'll go with ""UNSET"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn't have them.

So second guess: ""UNSET""

But note: we are putting N in the second position. We don't know if that's correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried, and also test more common letters.

Another word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. 
- S at 1st
- T at 2nd
- O at 3rd
- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.

Similarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.

So let's stick with ""UNSET"".

But note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven't tested N in second or E in fourth.

We also get to test U, S, T.

So I think that's a good choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in the 4th position.
- E is present but not in the 5th position.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).
2. Exclude C, R, A.
3. Test new letters to gather more information.
4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).

I considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E. Additionally, it tests three new common letters: U, S, T.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.\n\nIn English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.\n\nA good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I\'ll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.\n\nPopular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.\n\n""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nBut I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that\'s 5/5th most common to 1st?

Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.\n\nPerhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.\n\nBut ""CRANE"" is fine.

We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)\n- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)\n- Includes other common letters to test for presence.\n\nWe also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position.

We also want to cover new letters.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don\'t know if L, I, D are in the word.\n- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.\n- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.\n- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.\n\nBut note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.\n\nI think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: \n- S at position 1 (new letter)\n- P at position 2 (new letter)\n- I at position 3 (new letter)\n- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.\n\nSo let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.\n\nIn ""SPINE"":\n- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a \'-\' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won\'t get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.\n\nIn ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.\n\nSo let\'s avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.\n\nAnother word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.\n\n""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. \n- N is in 2nd position (new position)\n- E is in 4th position (we haven\'t tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n\nAlso, we get to test I, L, T.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without repeats for now.\n\nAnother word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E\'s.\n\n""INLET"" seems good: \n- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.\n\nBut let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.\n\nWe are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T\'s? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don\'t know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T\'s? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T\'s. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing new positions.\n\nAnother word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. \n- U is a new letter\n- N in 2nd (new position)\n- S in 3rd (new)\n- E in 4th (new position for E)\n- T in 5th (new)\n\nThis tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has U, S, T.\n\nI think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.\n\nSo ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that\'s okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.\n\nBut we are not putting E in 5th, so that\'s fine.\n\nHowever, we are putting T in 5th. We don\'t know about T.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.\n\nSo I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""UNSET"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nSo second guess: ""UNSET""\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the second position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven\'t tried and E in a position we haven\'t tried, and also test more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. \n- S at 1st\n- T at 2nd\n- O at 3rd\n- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""UNSET"".\n\nBut note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven\'t tested N in second or E in fourth.\n\nWe also get to test U, S, T.\n\nSo I think that\'s a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.\n- N is present but not in the 4th position.\n- E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).\n2. Exclude C, R, A.\n3. Test new letters to gather more information.\n4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).\n\nI considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E.

We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: UNSET -> Feedback: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- U and S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed N in 2nd and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E is in the word but not in the 4th position (we guessed E in 4th and got '-').
- T is in the word and in the 5th position (we guessed T in 5th and got '✓', meaning it's correct and in the right position).

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word contains: N, E, T (and T is fixed at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S.

Also, we know the positions:
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and also not in position 2 (from second guess).
- E is not in position 5 (from first guess) and also not in position 4 (from second guess).
- T is in position 5, so the word ends with T.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 5 is T).
- Contains N and E, but not in the positions we know are wrong.
- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

Possible positions for N: It can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N cannot be there. Also, we know N is not in 4th (from first guess) and not in 2nd (from second guess). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, E is not in 5th (from first guess) and not in 4th (from second guess). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.

Let's list the constraints:
- Position 5: T
- N must be in the word, but not in 2nd or 4th -> so N in 1st or 3rd.
- E must be in the word, but not in 4th or 5th -> so E in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- We must avoid C, R, A, U, S.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S, and also not repeating N and E in positions we know are invalid? Actually, we can use N and E again if the word has repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet. However, since the feedback for the first two guesses didn't show any duplicate, we might assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.

But note: the feedback for CRANE had N and E as present, but we don't know if they appear once or twice. Similarly for UNSET.

However, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have repeated letters, but without evidence, we can try to avoid duplicates.

So, the word pattern: _ _ _ _ T

We need to fill the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S.

Also, we must include N and E (since they are in the word) and place them in positions that are allowed.

Possible positions for N: 1 or 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).

Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are invalid).

But note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken by N?).
If we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is available for E? However, we know E is not in 4th? No, wait: the feedback for UNSET said E is not in 4th, but that doesn't mean E cannot be in 4th in a different word? Actually, the feedback is per guess. In UNSET, we put E in 4th and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in 4th. So E is not in 4th. But it could be in 4th in a different word? No, the feedback is for the specific guess. In the secret word, E is not in 4th, because we guessed it in 4th and got '-'. So that constraint applies to the secret word.

Similarly, E is not in 5th.

So for E: positions allowed are 1, 2, 3.

For N: positions allowed are 1, 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).

But note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3.
If we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4: we know E is not in 4th? So E cannot be in 4th? Therefore, if we put N in 3rd, then E must be in 1, 2, or 4? But we know E is not in 4th? So that's okay? Actually, we know E is not in 4th, so if we put E in 4th, we know it will be wrong? But we are trying to find the word, so we can put E in 4th to test? Actually, we already know E is not in 4th, so we don't need to test that. We should avoid putting E in 4th because we already know it's not there.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

So for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for N and E, and also test new letters.

We have two known letters: N and E, and we know T is at the end.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Contains N and E (but not in positions we know are invalid for them).
- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ _ _ T

With N and E in positions 1, 3, or 1/3 and 2/3/4.

But note: we have two letters to place (N and E) and two other positions to fill with new letters.

We should avoid using C, R, A, U, S.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use common letters: like L, I, O, etc.

Let me try to come up with words.

First, if N is in position 1, then the word is N _ _ _ T.

We need to put E in position 2 or 3.

Also, we need to avoid C, R, A, U, S.

So possibilities:
- N E _ _ T -> but E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4 need letters that are not C,R,A,U,S.

Example: ""NEWT"" -> but W and T? T is at the end, so if we put N E W T, but then we have T at the end? Actually, ""NEWT"" is N-E-W-T, so positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:W, 4:T? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, that's okay? But we already know T is in 5th? So we can use T again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

But note: we are allowed to repeat letters? The rules don't say we can't. But in the feedback, if we repeat a letter, it might be marked accordingly.

However, since we are trying to find the word, we might avoid repeats to get more information.

But let's see: we know T is in 5th, so if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we need to test their positions.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Then we have positions 3 and 4 to fill with new letters.

But we also have the constraint that E cannot be in 4th? Actually, we know E is not in 4th in the secret word, but in our guess, we can put E in 4th to test? But we already know it's not there? So we should avoid putting E in 4th to not waste a position.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th.

So for the next guess, we should put N in 1st or 3rd, and E in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th in the secret word? So in our guess, we can put E in 4th? But we know it will be wrong? So we might avoid that to test other positions.

So let's avoid putting E in 4th and N in 4th.

So for the guess, we can have:
- N in 1st, E in 2nd: then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 1st, E in 3rd: then positions 2 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 1st, E in 4th: but we know E is not in 4th? So invalid? So avoid.

- N in 3rd, E in 2nd: then positions 1 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 3rd, E in 3rd: not possible? Because one position is taken? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 4. So we can have E in 2nd and then N in 3rd? But then we have E in 2nd? That's allowed? But we already have E in 2nd? Actually, we are putting E in 2nd? Then N in 3rd? So the word would be: ? E N ? T

But we have to avoid C,R,A,U,S.

So words: 
- N E ? ? T -> but E in 2nd? Then we need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.

Example: ""NEWT"" as above? But that has W and T? And T is repeated? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But let's think of words without repeats.

""N E L L T"" -> has two L's? And E in 2nd? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try: ""NELL T"" -> not a word.

""N E W T"" -> ""NEWT"" is not a word.

""N E E T"" -> has two E's? And E in 2nd? But we don't know if E is repeated? Also, we are putting E in 2nd? Then we have E in 2nd? But we don't know if E is in 2nd? So we can try.

But let's avoid repeats: ""N E L L T"" has two L's? ""N E E T"" has two E's?.

What about ""N E I T"" -> ""NEIT"" is not a word.

""N E O T T"" -> has two T's? And O and T? But T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But ""N E O T T"" is not a word.

""N E L O T"" -> ""NELot"" is a word? (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T. This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.

Now, check constraints:
- N: in 1st -> allowed (since N can be in 1st or 3rd).
- E: in 2nd -> allowed (E can be in 2nd).
- T: in 5th -> correct.

Also, no C, R, A, U, S.

So ""NELot"" is a valid word? I think ""nelot"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument).

But note: we are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? And we are testing L and O.

But we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.

So let's consider both.

First, if N is in 1st, then the word is N _ _ _ T.

We need E in 2nd or 3rd.

If E in 2nd: then word is N E _ _ T.

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.

Examples: ""NEWT"" (but has W and T? and T is repeated) -> but we don't know about W and T? But T is already known to be in 5th? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But ""NEWT"" is not a word? Actually, ""newt"" is a word (a unit of weight or currency) but with two T's? And W.

But let's think of words: ""N E L L T"" (if we avoid repeat L) -> but L is new.

But we can try: ""N E L L T"" -> positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:T.

But we are testing L? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? But we know N is in the word? So if we put N in 1st, we might get a ✓ for N? Or if it's in the correct position? We don't know.

But we also have E in 2nd? We don't know if E is in 2nd.

But we are also testing L? And we have two L's? So if the word has L, we might get information.

But let's avoid repeats: ""N E I T"" is not a word.

""N E O T T"" is not a word.

""N E E T"" is not a word.

So ""NELot"" seems okay? But let's see if we can find a word without repeats.

Another word for N in 1st and E in 2nd: ""NEIST"" -> not a word.

""N E O T T"" is not a word.

So ""NELot"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a word with more common letters.

What about ""NEPT"" -> not 5 letters.

""N E L O T"" is a word (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T.

This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.

Constraints:
- N: in 1st -> allowed.
- E: in 2nd -> allowed.
- T: in 5th -> correct.

And no C,R,A,U,S.

So ""N E L O T"" is a valid word.

But note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E's positions.

But we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.

So let's consider the other case: N in 3rd.

Then the word is _ _ N _ T.

We need E in 1st, 2nd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th? So E in 1st or 2nd.

If E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.

Examples: ""E E N T"" -> has two E's? ""EINT"" is not a word.

""E L N T"" -> ""ELINT"" is not a word.

""E N N T"" -> has two N's? ""ENN T"" not a word.

""ENACT"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is absent? So no A.

""ENACT"" has A? So invalid.

""ENACT"" is E-N-A-C-T -> has A and C? Both absent? So invalid.

""ENACT"" is invalid.

""ELINT"" not a word.

""EMPT"" -> not 5 letters.

""ENACT"" invalid.

So it's hard to find a word with E in 1st and N in 3rd? And without A, C, R, U, S.

So let's go back to N in 1st and E in 2nd: like ""N E L O T"".

Or N in 1st and E in 3rd: then word is N _ E _ T.

Examples: ""N I E T"" -> ""N I E T"" is not a word.

""N O E E T"" -> has two E's? and O? But ""NOEET"" is not a word.

""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd? But we need E in 2nd? So no.

We need E in 2nd? So ""N E _ _ T"" -> then we have E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.

So ""N E L O T"" (if we avoid repeat O? ""N E L O T"" has O in 4th? and T in 5th? But T is already known? So we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.

But we also have the possibility that N is in 3rd? So let's try to cover both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in 3rd? But we don't have a good example.

Another word for N in 3rd: we need E in 1st or 2nd.

If E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.

Examples: ""E I N T"" -> ""EINT"" not a word.

""E O N T"" -> ""EONT"" not a word.

""E U N T"" -> ""EUNT"" not a word.

""ELINT"" not a word.

So it seems difficult to find a word with N in 3rd? So maybe N in 1st is more promising.

But we also have the possibility that E is in 3rd? So if we put N in 1st and E in 3rd? Then word: N _ E _ T.

Examples: ""N I E T"" not a word.

""N O E T T"" not a word.

""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But wait, we know E is not in 4th? So we cannot put E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.

So ""NOVET"" is N-O-V-E-T -> E is in 4th? Which we know is not allowed? So we should avoid.

So back to ""N E L O T"": N-E-L-O-T.

This tests:
- N in 1st: if it's correct, we get ✓ for N? If not, then we know N is in 3rd? Because we have tested 1st and 2nd? And 2nd is E? But we might test E in 3rd later.

But we also have E in 2nd? So we can test E in 2nd.

So I think ""N E L O T"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.

But we also have the possibility that the word has E in 3rd? So if we don't test E in 3rd, we might miss.

But we can test E in 3rd in the next guess if needed.

So let's go with ""N E L O T"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

So guess: ""N E L O T""

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""N I E T"" is not a word.

""N O E T T"" is not a word.

""N O V E T"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But we know E is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.

So ""N E L O T"" seems good.

But let me check: ""N E L O T"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical instrument.

So I'll go with ""N E L O T"".

But note: we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can test both.

So guess: ""N E L O T""

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters? We know C,R,A,U,S are absent? So ""N E L O T"" has N,E,L,O,T -> no forbidden letters? L and O are new.

So let's go with that.

But note: we have T at the end? So we know T is correct? So in the feedback, T will be ✓.

We are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E's positions.

But we also have L and O? So we test them.

So I think ""N E L O T"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""N E L O T"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- C, R, A, U, S are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (from CRANE) or 2 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- E is present but not in position 5 (from CRANE) or 4 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- T is present and in the correct position (position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ T

For the next guess, I need to test possible positions for N and E while avoiding forbidden letters. I chose ""N E L O T"" because:
- It places N in position 1 (a possible location) and E in position 2 (a possible location for E).
- It tests new common letters (L and O) to gather more information.
- It avoids repeating known absent letters (C, R, A, U, S) and forbidden positions for N and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of N and E and reveal if L or O are in the word.

<guess>NELOT</guess>",NELOT,"We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: UNSET -> Feedback: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- U and S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed N in 2nd and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E is in the word but not in the 4th position (we guessed E in 4th and got '-').
- T is in the word and in the 5th position (we guessed T in 5th and got '✓', meaning it's correct and in the right position).

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word contains: N, E, T (and T is fixed at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S.

Also, we know the positions:
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and also not in position 2 (from second guess).
- E is not in position 5 (from first guess) and also not in position 4 (from second guess).
- T is in position 5, so the word ends with T.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 5 is T).
- Contains N and E, but not in the positions we know are wrong.
- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

Possible positions for N: It can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N cannot be there. Also, we know N is not in 4th (from first guess) and not in 2nd (from second guess). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, E is not in 5th (from first guess) and not in 4th (from second guess). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.

Let's list the constraints:
- Position 5: T
- N must be in the word, but not in 2nd or 4th -> so N in 1st or 3rd.
- E must be in the word, but not in 4th or 5th -> so E in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- We must avoid C, R, A, U, S.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S, and also not repeating N and E in positions we know are invalid? Actually, we can use N and E again if the word has repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet. However, since the feedback for the first two guesses didn't show any duplicate, we might assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.

But note: the feedback for CRANE had N and E as present, but we don't know if they appear once or twice. Similarly for UNSET.

However, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have repeated letters, but without evidence, we can try to avoid duplicates.

So, the word pattern: _ _ _ _ T

We need to fill the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S.

Also, we must include N and E (since they are in the word) and place them in positions that are allowed.

Possible positions for N: 1 or 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).

Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are invalid).

But note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken by N?).
If we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is available for E? However, we know E is not in 4th? No, wait: the feedback for UNSET said E is not in 4th, but that doesn't mean E cannot be in 4th in a different word? Actually, the feedback is per guess. In UNSET, we put E in 4th and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in 4th. So E is not in 4th. But it could be in 4th in a different word? No, the feedback is for the specific guess. In the secret word, E is not in 4th, because we guessed it in 4th and got '-'. So that constraint applies to the secret word.

Similarly, E is not in 5th.

So for E: positions allowed are 1, 2, 3.

For N: positions allowed are 1, 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).

But note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3.
If we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4: we know E is not in 4th? So E cannot be in 4th? Therefore, if we put N in 3rd, then E must be in 1, 2, or 4? But we know E is not in 4th? So that's okay? Actually, we know E is not in 4th, so if we put E in 4th, we know it will be wrong? But we are trying to find the word, so we can put E in 4th to test? Actually, we already know E is not in 4th, so we don't need to test that. We should avoid putting E in 4th because we already know it's not there.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

So for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for N and E, and also test new letters.

We have two known letters: N and E, and we know T is at the end.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Contains N and E (but not in positions we know are invalid for them).
- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ _ _ T

With N and E in positions 1, 3, or 1/3 and 2/3/4.

But note: we have two letters to place (N and E) and two other positions to fill with new letters.

We should avoid using C, R, A, U, S.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use common letters: like L, I, O, etc.

Let me try to come up with words.

First, if N is in position 1, then the word is N _ _ _ T.

We need to put E in position 2 or 3.

Also, we need to avoid C, R, A, U, S.

So possibilities:
- N E _ _ T -> but E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4 need letters that are not C,R,A,U,S.

Example: ""NEWT"" -> but W and T? T is at the end, so if we put N E W T, but then we have T at the end? Actually, ""NEWT"" is N-E-W-T, so positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:W, 4:T? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, that's okay? But we already know T is in 5th? So we can use T again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

But note: we are allowed to repeat letters? The rules don't say we can't. But in the feedback, if we repeat a letter, it might be marked accordingly.

However, since we are trying to find the word, we might avoid repeats to get more information.

But let's see: we know T is in 5th, so if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we need to test their positions.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Then we have positions 3 and 4 to fill with new letters.

But we also have the constraint that E cannot be in 4th? Actually, we know E is not in 4th in the secret word, but in our guess, we can put E in 4th to test? But we already know it's not there? So we should avoid putting E in 4th to not waste a position.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th.

So for the next guess, we should put N in 1st or 3rd, and E in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th in the secret word? So in our guess, we can put E in 4th? But we know it will be wrong? So we might avoid that to test other positions.

So let's avoid putting E in 4th and N in 4th.

So for the guess, we can have:
- N in 1st, E in 2nd: then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 1st, E in 3rd: then positions 2 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 1st, E in 4th: but we know E is not in 4th? So invalid? So avoid.

- N in 3rd, E in 2nd: then positions 1 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 3rd, E in 3rd: not possible? Because one position is taken? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 4. So we can have E in 2nd and then N in 3rd? But then we have E in 2nd? That's allowed? But we already have E in 2nd? Actually, we are putting E in 2nd? Then N in 3rd? So the word would be: ? E N ? T

But we have to avoid C,R,A,U,S.

So words: 
- N E ? ? T -> but E in 2nd? Then we need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.

Example: ""NEWT"" as above? But that has W and T? And T is repeated? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But let's think of words without repeats.

""N E L L T"" -> has two L's? And E in 2nd? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try: ""NELL T"" -> not a word.

""N E W T"" -> ""NEWT"" is not a word.

""N E E T"" -> has two E's? And E in 2nd? But we don't know if E is repeated? Also, we are putting E in 2nd? Then we have E in 2nd? But we don't know if E is in 2nd? So we can try.

But let's avoid repeats: ""N E L L T"" has two L's? ""N E E T"" has two E's?.

What about ""N E I T"" -> ""NEIT"" is not a word.

""N E O T T"" -> has two T's? And O and T? But T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But ""N E O T T"" is not a word.

""N E L O T"" -> ""NELot"" is a word? (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T. This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.

Now, check constraints:
- N: in 1st -> allowed (since N can be in 1st or 3rd).
- E: in 2nd -> allowed (E can be in 2nd).
- T: in 5th -> correct.

Also, no C, R, A, U, S.

So ""NELot"" is a valid word? I think ""nelot"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument).

But note: we are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? And we are testing L and O.

But we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.

So let's consider both.

First, if N is in 1st, then the word is N _ _ _ T.

We need E in 2nd or 3rd.

If E in 2nd: then word is N E _ _ T.

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.

Examples: ""NEWT"" (but has W and T? and T is repeated) -> but we don't know about W and T? But T is already known to be in 5th? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But ""NEWT"" is not a word? Actually, ""newt"" is a word (a unit of weight or currency) but with two T's? And W.

But let's think of words: ""N E L L T"" (if we avoid repeat L) -> but L is new.

But we can try: ""N E L L T"" -> positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:T.

But we are testing L? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? But we know N is in the word? So if we put N in 1st, we might get a ✓ for N? Or if it's in the correct position? We don't know.

But we also have E in 2nd? We don't know if E is in 2nd.

But we are also testing L? And we have two L's? So if the word has L, we might get information.

But let's avoid repeats: ""N E I T"" is not a word.

""N E O T T"" is not a word.

""N E E T"" is not a word.

So ""NELot"" seems okay? But let's see if we can find a word without repeats.

Another word for N in 1st and E in 2nd: ""NEIST"" -> not a word.

""N E O T T"" is not a word.

So ""NELot"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a word with more common letters.

What about ""NEPT"" -> not 5 letters.

""N E L O T"" is a word (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T.

This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.

Constraints:
- N: in 1st -> allowed.
- E: in 2nd -> allowed.
- T: in 5th -> correct.

And no C,R,A,U,S.

So ""N E L O T"" is a valid word.

But note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E's positions.

But we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.

So let's consider the other case: N in 3rd.

Then the word is _ _ N _ T.

We need E in 1st, 2nd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th? So E in 1st or 2nd.

If E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.

Examples: ""E E N T"" -> has two E's? ""EINT"" is not a word.

""E L N T"" -> ""ELINT"" is not a word.

""E N N T"" -> has two N's? ""ENN T"" not a word.

""ENACT"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is absent? So no A.

""ENACT"" has A? So invalid.

""ENACT"" is E-N-A-C-T -> has A and C? Both absent? So invalid.

""ENACT"" is invalid.

""ELINT"" not a word.

""EMPT"" -> not 5 letters.

""ENACT"" invalid.

So it's hard to find a word with E in 1st and N in 3rd? And without A, C, R, U, S.

So let's go back to N in 1st and E in 2nd: like ""N E L O T"".

Or N in 1st and E in 3rd: then word is N _ E _ T.

Examples: ""N I E T"" -> ""N I E T"" is not a word.

""N O E E T"" -> has two E's? and O? But ""NOEET"" is not a word.

""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd? But we need E in 2nd? So no.

We need E in 2nd? So ""N E _ _ T"" -> then we have E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.

So ""N E L O T"" (if we avoid repeat O? ""N E L O T"" has O in 4th? and T in 5th? But T is already known? So we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.

But we also have the possibility that N is in 3rd? So let's try to cover both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in 3rd? But we don't have a good example.

Another word for N in 3rd: we need E in 1st or 2nd.

If E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.

Examples: ""E I N T"" -> ""EINT"" not a word.

""E O N T"" -> ""EONT"" not a word.

""E U N T"" -> ""EUNT"" not a word.

""ELINT"" not a word.

So it seems difficult to find a word with N in 3rd? So maybe N in 1st is more promising.

But we also have the possibility that E is in 3rd? So if we put N in 1st and E in 3rd? Then word: N _ E _ T.

Examples: ""N I E T"" not a word.

""N O E T T"" not a word.

""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But wait, we know E is not in 4th? So we cannot put E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.

So ""NOVET"" is N-O-V-E-T -> E is in 4th? Which we know is not allowed? So we should avoid.

So back to ""N E L O T"": N-E-L-O-T.

This tests:
- N in 1st: if it's correct, we get ✓ for N? If not, then we know N is in 3rd? Because we have tested 1st and 2nd? And 2nd is E? But we might test E in 3rd later.

But we also have E in 2nd? So we can test E in 2nd.

So I think ""N E L O T"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.

But we also have the possibility that the word has E in 3rd? So if we don't test E in 3rd, we might miss.

But we can test E in 3rd in the next guess if needed.

So let's go with ""N E L O T"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

So guess: ""N E L O T""

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""N I E T"" is not a word.

""N O E T T"" is not a word.

""N O V E T"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But we know E is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.

So ""N E L O T"" seems good.

But let me check: ""N E L O T"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical instrument.

So I'll go with ""N E L O T"".

But note: we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can test both.

So guess: ""N E L O T""

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters? We know C,R,A,U,S are absent? So ""N E L O T"" has N,E,L,O,T -> no forbidden letters? L and O are new.

So let's go with that.

But note: we have T at the end? So we know T is correct? So in the feedback, T will be ✓.

We are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E's positions.

But we also have L and O? So we test them.

So I think ""N E L O T"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""N E L O T"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- C, R, A, U, S are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (from CRANE) or 2 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- E is present but not in position 5 (from CRANE) or 4 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- T is present and in the correct position (position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ T

For the next guess, I need to test possible positions for N and E while avoiding forbidden letters. I chose ""N E L O T"" because:
- It places N in position 1 (a possible location) and E in position 2 (a possible location for E).
- It tests new common letters (L and O) to gather more information.
- It avoids repeating known absent letters (C, R, A, U, S) and forbidden positions for N and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of N and E and reveal if L or O are in the word.",Guess 5: NELOT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) L(x) O(x) T(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.

In English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I'll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.

Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.

""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:

E (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.

So, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.

But ""CRANE"" is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

It's a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter and E was the 5th).

Therefore, the secret word contains N and E, but not C, R, or A.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)
- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

But note: the feedback for E is a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. Similarly for N, it is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put N and E in different positions to test where they might be.

We also want to avoid using C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters.

For example, we know N is not in position 4. So we can try N in position 1, 2, or 3.
Similarly, E is not in position 5, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (N and E) and we want to test their positions. We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Possible words: 
- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.
- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.
- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.

But note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.

I think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new letter)
- P at position 2 (new letter)
- I at position 3 (new letter)
- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.

So let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"":
- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a '-' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won't get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

In ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.

So let's avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.

Another word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. 
- N is in 2nd position (new position)
- E is in 4th position (we haven't tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)
- Avoids C, R, A.

Also, we get to test I, L, T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.

But let's stick to words without repeats for now.

Another word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E's.

""INLET"" seems good: 
- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.

But let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.

We are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.

Alternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T's? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don't know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T's? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T's. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.

But note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing new positions.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. 
- U is a new letter
- N in 2nd (new position)
- S in 3rd (new)
- E in 4th (new position for E)
- T in 5th (new)

This tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.

But we don't know if the word has U, S, T.

I think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.

So ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.

Similarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that's okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.

But we are not putting E in 5th, so that's fine.

However, we are putting T in 5th. We don't know about T.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.

So I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.

But let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.

So I'll go with ""UNSET"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn't have them.

So second guess: ""UNSET""

But note: we are putting N in the second position. We don't know if that's correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried, and also test more common letters.

Another word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. 
- S at 1st
- T at 2nd
- O at 3rd
- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.

Similarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.

So let's stick with ""UNSET"".

But note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven't tested N in second or E in fourth.

We also get to test U, S, T.

So I think that's a good choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in the 4th position.
- E is present but not in the 5th position.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).
2. Exclude C, R, A.
3. Test new letters to gather more information.
4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).

I considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E. Additionally, it tests three new common letters: U, S, T.

We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: UNSET -> Feedback: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- U and S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed N in 2nd and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E is in the word but not in the 4th position (we guessed E in 4th and got '-').
- T is in the word and in the 5th position (we guessed T in 5th and got '✓', meaning it's correct and in the right position).

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word contains: N, E, T (and T is fixed at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S.

Also, we know the positions:
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and also not in position 2 (from second guess).
- E is not in position 5 (from first guess) and also not in position 4 (from second guess).
- T is in position 5, so the word ends with T.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 5 is T).
- Contains N and E, but not in the positions we know are wrong.
- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

Possible positions for N: It can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N cannot be there. Also, we know N is not in 4th (from first guess) and not in 2nd (from second guess). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, E is not in 5th (from first guess) and not in 4th (from second guess). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.

Let's list the constraints:
- Position 5: T
- N must be in the word, but not in 2nd or 4th -> so N in 1st or 3rd.
- E must be in the word, but not in 4th or 5th -> so E in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- We must avoid C, R, A, U, S.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S, and also not repeating N and E in positions we know are invalid? Actually, we can use N and E again if the word has repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet. However, since the feedback for the first two guesses didn't show any duplicate, we might assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.

But note: the feedback for CRANE had N and E as present, but we don't know if they appear once or twice. Similarly for UNSET.

However, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have repeated letters, but without evidence, we can try to avoid duplicates.

So, the word pattern: _ _ _ _ T

We need to fill the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S.

Also, we must include N and E (since they are in the word) and place them in positions that are allowed.

Possible positions for N: 1 or 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).

Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are invalid).

But note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken by N?).
If we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is available for E? However, we know E is not in 4th? No, wait: the feedback for UNSET said E is not in 4th, but that doesn't mean E cannot be in 4th in a different word? Actually, the feedback is per guess. In UNSET, we put E in 4th and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in 4th. So E is not in 4th. But it could be in 4th in a different word? No, the feedback is for the specific guess. In the secret word, E is not in 4th, because we guessed it in 4th and got '-'. So that constraint applies to the secret word.

Similarly, E is not in 5th.

So for E: positions allowed are 1, 2, 3.

For N: positions allowed are 1, 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).

But note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3.
If we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4: we know E is not in 4th? So E cannot be in 4th? Therefore, if we put N in 3rd, then E must be in 1, 2, or 4? But we know E is not in 4th? So that's okay? Actually, we know E is not in 4th, so if we put E in 4th, we know it will be wrong? But we are trying to find the word, so we can put E in 4th to test? Actually, we already know E is not in 4th, so we don't need to test that. We should avoid putting E in 4th because we already know it's not there.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.

So for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for N and E, and also test new letters.

We have two known letters: N and E, and we know T is at the end.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Contains N and E (but not in positions we know are invalid for them).
- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ _ _ T

With N and E in positions 1, 3, or 1/3 and 2/3/4.

But note: we have two letters to place (N and E) and two other positions to fill with new letters.

We should avoid using C, R, A, U, S.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use common letters: like L, I, O, etc.

Let me try to come up with words.

First, if N is in position 1, then the word is N _ _ _ T.

We need to put E in position 2 or 3.

Also, we need to avoid C, R, A, U, S.

So possibilities:
- N E _ _ T -> but E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4 need letters that are not C,R,A,U,S.

Example: ""NEWT"" -> but W and T? T is at the end, so if we put N E W T, but then we have T at the end? Actually, ""NEWT"" is N-E-W-T, so positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:W, 4:T? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, that's okay? But we already know T is in 5th? So we can use T again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

But note: we are allowed to repeat letters? The rules don't say we can't. But in the feedback, if we repeat a letter, it might be marked accordingly.

However, since we are trying to find the word, we might avoid repeats to get more information.

But let's see: we know T is in 5th, so if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat T.

But note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we need to test their positions.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Then we have positions 3 and 4 to fill with new letters.

But we also have the constraint that E cannot be in 4th? Actually, we know E is not in 4th in the secret word, but in our guess, we can put E in 4th to test? But we already know it's not there? So we should avoid putting E in 4th to not waste a position.

Similarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th.

So for the next guess, we should put N in 1st or 3rd, and E in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th in the secret word? So in our guess, we can put E in 4th? But we know it will be wrong? So we might avoid that to test other positions.

So let's avoid putting E in 4th and N in 4th.

So for the guess, we can have:
- N in 1st, E in 2nd: then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 1st, E in 3rd: then positions 2 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 1st, E in 4th: but we know E is not in 4th? So invalid? So avoid.

- N in 3rd, E in 2nd: then positions 1 and 4: two new letters.
- N in 3rd, E in 3rd: not possible? Because one position is taken? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 4. So we can have E in 2nd and then N in 3rd? But then we have E in 2nd? That's allowed? But we already have E in 2nd? Actually, we are putting E in 2nd? Then N in 3rd? So the word would be: ? E N ? T

But we have to avoid C,R,A,U,S.

So words: 
- N E ? ? T -> but E in 2nd? Then we need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.

Example: ""NEWT"" as above? But that has W and T? And T is repeated? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But let's think of words without repeats.

""N E L L T"" -> has two L's? And E in 2nd? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try: ""NELL T"" -> not a word.

""N E W T"" -> ""NEWT"" is not a word.

""N E E T"" -> has two E's? And E in 2nd? But we don't know if E is repeated? Also, we are putting E in 2nd? Then we have E in 2nd? But we don't know if E is in 2nd? So we can try.

But let's avoid repeats: ""N E L L T"" has two L's? ""N E E T"" has two E's?.

What about ""N E I T"" -> ""NEIT"" is not a word.

""N E O T T"" -> has two T's? And O and T? But T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But ""N E O T T"" is not a word.

""N E L O T"" -> ""NELot"" is a word? (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T. This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.

Now, check constraints:
- N: in 1st -> allowed (since N can be in 1st or 3rd).
- E: in 2nd -> allowed (E can be in 2nd).
- T: in 5th -> correct.

Also, no C, R, A, U, S.

So ""NELot"" is a valid word? I think ""nelot"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument).

But note: we are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? And we are testing L and O.

But we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.

So let's consider both.

First, if N is in 1st, then the word is N _ _ _ T.

We need E in 2nd or 3rd.

If E in 2nd: then word is N E _ _ T.

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.

Examples: ""NEWT"" (but has W and T? and T is repeated) -> but we don't know about W and T? But T is already known to be in 5th? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.

But ""NEWT"" is not a word? Actually, ""newt"" is a word (a unit of weight or currency) but with two T's? And W.

But let's think of words: ""N E L L T"" (if we avoid repeat L) -> but L is new.

But we can try: ""N E L L T"" -> positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:T.

But we are testing L? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? But we know N is in the word? So if we put N in 1st, we might get a ✓ for N? Or if it's in the correct position? We don't know.

But we also have E in 2nd? We don't know if E is in 2nd.

But we are also testing L? And we have two L's? So if the word has L, we might get information.

But let's avoid repeats: ""N E I T"" is not a word.

""N E O T T"" is not a word.

""N E E T"" is not a word.

So ""NELot"" seems okay? But let's see if we can find a word without repeats.

Another word for N in 1st and E in 2nd: ""NEIST"" -> not a word.

""N E O T T"" is not a word.

So ""NELot"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a word with more common letters.

What about ""NEPT"" -> not 5 letters.

""N E L O T"" is a word (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T.

This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.

Constraints:
- N: in 1st -> allowed.
- E: in 2nd -> allowed.
- T: in 5th -> correct.

And no C,R,A,U,S.

So ""N E L O T"" is a valid word.

But note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E's positions.

But we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.

So let's consider the other case: N in 3rd.

Then the word is _ _ N _ T.

We need E in 1st, 2nd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th? So E in 1st or 2nd.

If E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.

Examples: ""E E N T"" -> has two E's? ""EINT"" is not a word.

""E L N T"" -> ""ELINT"" is not a word.

""E N N T"" -> has two N's? ""ENN T"" not a word.

""ENACT"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is absent? So no A.

""ENACT"" has A? So invalid.

""ENACT"" is E-N-A-C-T -> has A and C? Both absent? So invalid.

""ENACT"" is invalid.

""ELINT"" not a word.

""EMPT"" -> not 5 letters.

""ENACT"" invalid.

So it's hard to find a word with E in 1st and N in 3rd? And without A, C, R, U, S.

So let's go back to N in 1st and E in 2nd: like ""N E L O T"".

Or N in 1st and E in 3rd: then word is N _ E _ T.

Examples: ""N I E T"" -> ""N I E T"" is not a word.

""N O E E T"" -> has two E's? and O? But ""NOEET"" is not a word.

""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd? But we need E in 2nd? So no.

We need E in 2nd? So ""N E _ _ T"" -> then we have E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.

So ""N E L O T"" (if we avoid repeat O? ""N E L O T"" has O in 4th? and T in 5th? But T is already known? So we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.

But we also have the possibility that N is in 3rd? So let's try to cover both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in 3rd? But we don't have a good example.

Another word for N in 3rd: we need E in 1st or 2nd.

If E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.

Examples: ""E I N T"" -> ""EINT"" not a word.

""E O N T"" -> ""EONT"" not a word.

""E U N T"" -> ""EUNT"" not a word.

""ELINT"" not a word.

So it seems difficult to find a word with N in 3rd? So maybe N in 1st is more promising.

But we also have the possibility that E is in 3rd? So if we put N in 1st and E in 3rd? Then word: N _ E _ T.

Examples: ""N I E T"" not a word.

""N O E T T"" not a word.

""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But wait, we know E is not in 4th? So we cannot put E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.

So ""NOVET"" is N-O-V-E-T -> E is in 4th? Which we know is not allowed? So we should avoid.

So back to ""N E L O T"": N-E-L-O-T.

This tests:
- N in 1st: if it's correct, we get ✓ for N? If not, then we know N is in 3rd? Because we have tested 1st and 2nd? And 2nd is E? But we might test E in 3rd later.

But we also have E in 2nd? So we can test E in 2nd.

So I think ""N E L O T"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.

But we also have the possibility that the word has E in 3rd? So if we don't test E in 3rd, we might miss.

But we can test E in 3rd in the next guess if needed.

So let's go with ""N E L O T"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

So guess: ""N E L O T""

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""N I E T"" is not a word.

""N O E T T"" is not a word.

""N O V E T"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.

This has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But we know E is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.

So ""N E L O T"" seems good.

But let me check: ""N E L O T"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical instrument.

So I'll go with ""N E L O T"".

But note: we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can test both.

So guess: ""N E L O T""

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters? We know C,R,A,U,S are absent? So ""N E L O T"" has N,E,L,O,T -> no forbidden letters? L and O are new.

So let's go with that.

But note: we have T at the end? So we know T is correct? So in the feedback, T will be ✓.

We are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E's positions.

But we also have L and O? So we test them.

So I think ""N E L O T"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""N E L O T"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- C, R, A, U, S are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (from CRANE) or 2 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- E is present but not in position 5 (from CRANE) or 4 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- T is present and in the correct position (position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ T

For the next guess, I need to test possible positions for N and E while avoiding forbidden letters. I chose ""N E L O T"" because:
- It places N in position 1 (a possible location) and E in position 2 (a possible location for E).
- It tests new common letters (L and O) to gather more information.
- It avoids repeating known absent letters (C, R, A, U, S) and forbidden positions for N and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of N and E and reveal if L or O are in the word.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that might appear in many words.\n\nIn English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should aim for a word that includes several of these.\n\nA good starting word often has unique letters to cover more possibilities. Words with repeated letters give less information because if a letter is correct but repeated, it might not show as a separate ✓ or - each time. So, I\'ll avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess.\n\nPopular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These use common letters and have no repeats.\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is a good one because it has C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common and distinct.\n\n""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nBut I should consider letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that\'s 5/5th most common to 1st? Actually, E is the most common, then A, R, I? Let me check:\n\nE (12.7%), A (8.1%), R (7.5%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), C (2.7%), etc.\n\nSo, a word with E, A, R, I, O might be better than one with T and N? Not necessarily, T and N are also high frequency.\n\nPerhaps ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E. That has R, A, I, S, E: E is 1st, A 2nd, R 3rd, I 4th, S 5th. But ""RAISE"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""ORATE"" – O, R, A, T, E. O is 4th, R 3rd, A 2nd, T 5th, E 1st. Still good.\n\nBut ""CRANE"" is fine. I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.\n\nIt\'s a common starting word, and it should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.\n\nSo, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter and E was the 5th).\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains N and E, but not C, R, or A.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters long.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A (since they are absent)\n- Contains N and E (since they are present, but in different positions)\n- Includes other common letters to test for presence.\n\nWe also know that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, 3rd (since 4th is wrong and 5th is not possible because E is there, but note: N could be in 5th? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about 5th position for N. However, we know E is in the word and not in 5th, but N could be in 5th? Actually, the feedback for N is only that it is in the word but not in the 4th position. Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E is a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. Similarly for N, it is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we can try to put N and E in different positions to test where they might be.\n\nWe also want to avoid using C, R, A.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven\'t tested, and also includes other common letters.\n\nFor example, we know N is not in position 4. So we can try N in position 1, 2, or 3.\nSimilarly, E is not in position 5, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word (N and E) and we want to test their positions. We also want to cover new letters.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> has N and E. But note: we don\'t know if L, I, D are in the word.\n- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> has N and E, and avoids C, R, A.\n- ""MINCE"": but C is not allowed (we know C is absent) -> invalid.\n- ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> has N and E.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know N is in the word but not in 4th, and E is in the word but not in 5th, we can try to put N in the first position and E in the second? Or other combinations.\n\nBut note: we have two letters that must be included (N and E) and we want to test their positions.\n\nI think ""SPINE"" is a good candidate: \n- S at position 1 (new letter)\n- P at position 2 (new letter)\n- I at position 3 (new letter)\n- N at position 4 (we know N is not in 4th? Wait, the feedback said N is in the word but not in 4th. So if we put N in 4th, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th. But in our guess, we can put N in 4th to test? However, we already know that 4th is wrong for N, so it would be a waste to put N in 4th again. We should try a new position.\n\nSo let me reconsider: we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.\n\nIn ""SPINE"":\n- N is in 4th: we know that in the secret word, N is not in 4th, so if we put N in 4th, we will get a \'-\' for N (if the secret word has N) and we won\'t get new information about the position of N. Similarly, E is in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? Wait, in ""SPINE"", E is at the end? But the feedback said E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.\n\nIn ""SPINE"", E is at position 5. But we know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid that.\n\nSo let\'s avoid putting E in 5th and N in 4th.\n\nAnother word: ""SENTE"" is not a word.\n\n""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> has N and E. \n- N is in 2nd position (new position)\n- E is in 4th position (we haven\'t tested 4th for E? Previously E was in 5th, so 4th is new)\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n\nAlso, we get to test I, L, T.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we are testing three new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""NEEDY"": N, E, E, D, Y -> has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? Also, we are repeating E? We might get less information.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without repeats for now.\n\nAnother word: ""SLEET"": S, L, E, E, T -> again two E\'s.\n\n""INLET"" seems good: \n- Inlet: a small opening or a narrow channel, typically of a river or a building. It is 5 letters.\n\nBut let me confirm: I-N-L-E-T -> positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T.\n\nWe are testing N at position 2 and E at position 4. Also, we test I, L, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""STENT"": S, T, E, N, T -> has N and E. But note: we have two T\'s? That might not be ideal because if one T is correct, we don\'t know which one? But the feedback will show for each position.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats: ""STENT"" has two T\'s? Actually, ""STENT"" is S-T-E-N-T -> two T\'s. So we are testing S, T, E, N, but we are repeating T. So we get less information.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo ""INLET"" seems good: all distinct letters.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing new positions.\n\nAnother word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> has N and E. \n- U is a new letter\n- N in 2nd (new position)\n- S in 3rd (new)\n- E in 4th (new position for E)\n- T in 5th (new)\n\nThis tests U, S, T, and we know N and E are present.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has U, S, T.\n\nI think ""UNSET"" is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""INSET"": I-N-S-E-T -> has N and E. But note: E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not in 5th, so we should avoid putting E in 5th.\n\nSo ""INSET"" is invalid because E is in 5th.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNSET"" is U-N-S-E-T -> E is in 5th? No: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). So E is in 4th and T in 5th? Actually, E is in 4th and T in 5th? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. So E is in 4th and T in 5th. But we know E is not in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so that\'s okay. But we are not putting E in 5th? Actually, the feedback only said E is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th. So we can put E in 4th.\n\nBut we are not putting E in 5th, so that\'s fine.\n\nHowever, we are putting T in 5th. We don\'t know about T.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use both N and E? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get information about their positions.\n\nSo I think ""UNSET"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: U, N, S, E, T -> all distinct, and we avoid C, R, A.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""UNSET"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters. We know C, R, A are absent, and ""UNSET"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nSo second guess: ""UNSET""\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the second position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. Similarly, E in the fourth.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put N in a position we haven\'t tried and E in a position we haven\'t tried, and also test more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> has N and E. \n- S at 1st\n- T at 2nd\n- O at 3rd\n- N at 4th: but we know N is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting N in 4th. Therefore, ""STONE"" is invalid because it puts N in 4th.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPINE"" puts N in 4th and E in 5th, which we know are wrong? So avoid.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""UNSET"".\n\nBut note: in ""UNSET"", we are putting N in the second position and E in the fourth. We haven\'t tested N in second or E in fourth.\n\nWe also get to test U, S, T.\n\nSo I think that\'s a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""UNSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.\n- N is present but not in the 4th position.\n- E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Include both N and E (since they are in the word).\n2. Exclude C, R, A.\n3. Test new letters to gather more information.\n4. Avoid placing N in the 4th position or E in the 5th position (since we know those positions are incorrect for them).\n\nI considered words like ""INLET"" (I-N-L-E-T) and ""UNSET"" (U-N-S-E-T), but ""UNSET"" places N in the 2nd position and E in the 4th position, which are new positions for these letters. This should help identify the correct positions of N and E. Additionally, it tests three new common letters: U, S, T.\n\n<guess>UNSET</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNSET -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNSET -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNSET -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: UNSET -> Feedback: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)\nMeaning:\n- U and S are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed N in 2nd and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- E is in the word but not in the 4th position (we guessed E in 4th and got \'-\').\n- T is in the word and in the 5th position (we guessed T in 5th and got \'✓\', meaning it\'s correct and in the right position).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n- The secret word contains: N, E, T (and T is fixed at the end).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, U, S.\n\nAlso, we know the positions:\n- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and also not in position 2 (from second guess).\n- E is not in position 5 (from first guess) and also not in position 4 (from second guess).\n- T is in position 5, so the word ends with T.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with T (position 5 is T).\n- Contains N and E, but not in the positions we know are wrong.\n- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.\n\nPossible positions for N: It can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N cannot be there. Also, we know N is not in 4th (from first guess) and not in 2nd (from second guess). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is T, so N must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, E is not in 5th (from first guess) and not in 4th (from second guess). So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.\n\nLet\'s list the constraints:\n- Position 5: T\n- N must be in the word, but not in 2nd or 4th -> so N in 1st or 3rd.\n- E must be in the word, but not in 4th or 5th -> so E in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.\n- We must avoid C, R, A, U, S.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S, and also not repeating N and E in positions we know are invalid? Actually, we can use N and E again if the word has repeated letters, but we don\'t have evidence of that yet. However, since the feedback for the first two guesses didn\'t show any duplicate, we might assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.\n\nBut note: the feedback for CRANE had N and E as present, but we don\'t know if they appear once or twice. Similarly for UNSET.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have repeated letters, but without evidence, we can try to avoid duplicates.\n\nSo, the word pattern: _ _ _ _ T\n\nWe need to fill the first four positions with letters that are not C, R, A, U, S.\n\nAlso, we must include N and E (since they are in the word) and place them in positions that are allowed.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1 or 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).\n\nPossible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are invalid).\n\nBut note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken by N?).\nIf we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is available for E? However, we know E is not in 4th? No, wait: the feedback for UNSET said E is not in 4th, but that doesn\'t mean E cannot be in 4th in a different word? Actually, the feedback is per guess. In UNSET, we put E in 4th and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not in 4th. So E is not in 4th. But it could be in 4th in a different word? No, the feedback is for the specific guess. In the secret word, E is not in 4th, because we guessed it in 4th and got \'-\'. So that constraint applies to the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, E is not in 5th.\n\nSo for E: positions allowed are 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor N: positions allowed are 1, 3 (since 2 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is T).\n\nBut note: if we put N in position 1, then E can be in 2 or 3.\nIf we put N in position 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4: we know E is not in 4th? So E cannot be in 4th? Therefore, if we put N in 3rd, then E must be in 1, 2, or 4? But we know E is not in 4th? So that\'s okay? Actually, we know E is not in 4th, so if we put E in 4th, we know it will be wrong? But we are trying to find the word, so we can put E in 4th to test? Actually, we already know E is not in 4th, so we don\'t need to test that. We should avoid putting E in 4th because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th and E in 5th.\n\nSo for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for N and E, and also test new letters.\n\nWe have two known letters: N and E, and we know T is at the end.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Ends with T.\n- Contains N and E (but not in positions we know are invalid for them).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, U, S.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit: _ _ _ _ T\n\nWith N and E in positions 1, 3, or 1/3 and 2/3/4.\n\nBut note: we have two letters to place (N and E) and two other positions to fill with new letters.\n\nWe should avoid using C, R, A, U, S.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to use common letters: like L, I, O, etc.\n\nLet me try to come up with words.\n\nFirst, if N is in position 1, then the word is N _ _ _ T.\n\nWe need to put E in position 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid C, R, A, U, S.\n\nSo possibilities:\n- N E _ _ T -> but E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4 need letters that are not C,R,A,U,S.\n\nExample: ""NEWT"" -> but W and T? T is at the end, so if we put N E W T, but then we have T at the end? Actually, ""NEWT"" is N-E-W-T, so positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:W, 4:T? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, that\'s okay? But we already know T is in 5th? So we can use T again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to repeat letters? The rules don\'t say we can\'t. But in the feedback, if we repeat a letter, it might be marked accordingly.\n\nHowever, since we are trying to find the word, we might avoid repeats to get more information.\n\nBut let\'s see: we know T is in 5th, so if we put T in 4th, we might get information.\n\nBut we have limited guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t repeat T.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (N and E) and we need to test their positions.\n\nWe can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Then we have positions 3 and 4 to fill with new letters.\n\nBut we also have the constraint that E cannot be in 4th? Actually, we know E is not in 4th in the secret word, but in our guess, we can put E in 4th to test? But we already know it\'s not there? So we should avoid putting E in 4th to not waste a position.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting N in 4th.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should put N in 1st or 3rd, and E in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th in the secret word? So in our guess, we can put E in 4th? But we know it will be wrong? So we might avoid that to test other positions.\n\nSo let\'s avoid putting E in 4th and N in 4th.\n\nSo for the guess, we can have:\n- N in 1st, E in 2nd: then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.\n- N in 1st, E in 3rd: then positions 2 and 4: two new letters.\n- N in 1st, E in 4th: but we know E is not in 4th? So invalid? So avoid.\n\n- N in 3rd, E in 2nd: then positions 1 and 4: two new letters.\n- N in 3rd, E in 3rd: not possible? Because one position is taken? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 4. So we can have E in 2nd and then N in 3rd? But then we have E in 2nd? That\'s allowed? But we already have E in 2nd? Actually, we are putting E in 2nd? Then N in 3rd? So the word would be: ? E N ? T\n\nBut we have to avoid C,R,A,U,S.\n\nSo words: \n- N E ? ? T -> but E in 2nd? Then we need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.\n\nExample: ""NEWT"" as above? But that has W and T? And T is repeated? But we know T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.\n\nBut let\'s think of words without repeats.\n\n""N E L L T"" -> has two L\'s? And E in 2nd? But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nBut we can try: ""NELL T"" -> not a word.\n\n""N E W T"" -> ""NEWT"" is not a word.\n\n""N E E T"" -> has two E\'s? And E in 2nd? But we don\'t know if E is repeated? Also, we are putting E in 2nd? Then we have E in 2nd? But we don\'t know if E is in 2nd? So we can try.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats: ""N E L L T"" has two L\'s? ""N E E T"" has two E\'s?.\n\nWhat about ""N E I T"" -> ""NEIT"" is not a word.\n\n""N E O T T"" -> has two T\'s? And O and T? But T is at the end? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.\n\nBut ""N E O T T"" is not a word.\n\n""N E L O T"" -> ""NELot"" is a word? (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T. This has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- N: in 1st -> allowed (since N can be in 1st or 3rd).\n- E: in 2nd -> allowed (E can be in 2nd).\n- T: in 5th -> correct.\n\nAlso, no C, R, A, U, S.\n\nSo ""NELot"" is a valid word? I think ""nelot"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument).\n\nBut note: we are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? And we are testing L and O.\n\nBut we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.\n\nSo let\'s consider both.\n\nFirst, if N is in 1st, then the word is N _ _ _ T.\n\nWe need E in 2nd or 3rd.\n\nIf E in 2nd: then word is N E _ _ T.\n\nWe need two letters for positions 3 and 4? And then T at the end.\n\nExamples: ""NEWT"" (but has W and T? and T is repeated) -> but we don\'t know about W and T? But T is already known to be in 5th? So if we put T in 4th, we might get information.\n\nBut ""NEWT"" is not a word? Actually, ""newt"" is a word (a unit of weight or currency) but with two T\'s? And W.\n\nBut let\'s think of words: ""N E L L T"" (if we avoid repeat L) -> but L is new.\n\nBut we can try: ""N E L L T"" -> positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:T.\n\nBut we are testing L? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? But we know N is in the word? So if we put N in 1st, we might get a ✓ for N? Or if it\'s in the correct position? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we also have E in 2nd? We don\'t know if E is in 2nd.\n\nBut we are also testing L? And we have two L\'s? So if the word has L, we might get information.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats: ""N E I T"" is not a word.\n\n""N E O T T"" is not a word.\n\n""N E E T"" is not a word.\n\nSo ""NELot"" seems okay? But let\'s see if we can find a word without repeats.\n\nAnother word for N in 1st and E in 2nd: ""NEIST"" -> not a word.\n\n""N E O T T"" is not a word.\n\nSo ""NELot"" is acceptable? But let\'s see if there\'s a word with more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""NEPT"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""N E L O T"" is a word (a type of musical instrument) -> N-E-L-O-T.\n\nThis has N in 1st, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, O in 4th, T in 5th.\n\nConstraints:\n- N: in 1st -> allowed.\n- E: in 2nd -> allowed.\n- T: in 5th -> correct.\n\nAnd no C,R,A,U,S.\n\nSo ""N E L O T"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E\'s positions.\n\nBut we also have the possibility of N in 3rd.\n\nSo let\'s consider the other case: N in 3rd.\n\nThen the word is _ _ N _ T.\n\nWe need E in 1st, 2nd, or 4th? But E cannot be in 4th? So E in 1st or 2nd.\n\nIf E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.\n\nExamples: ""E E N T"" -> has two E\'s? ""EINT"" is not a word.\n\n""E L N T"" -> ""ELINT"" is not a word.\n\n""E N N T"" -> has two N\'s? ""ENN T"" not a word.\n\n""ENACT"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is absent? So no A.\n\n""ENACT"" has A? So invalid.\n\n""ENACT"" is E-N-A-C-T -> has A and C? Both absent? So invalid.\n\n""ENACT"" is invalid.\n\n""ELINT"" not a word.\n\n""EMPT"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""ENACT"" invalid.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with E in 1st and N in 3rd? And without A, C, R, U, S.\n\nSo let\'s go back to N in 1st and E in 2nd: like ""N E L O T"".\n\nOr N in 1st and E in 3rd: then word is N _ E _ T.\n\nExamples: ""N I E T"" -> ""N I E T"" is not a word.\n\n""N O E E T"" -> has two E\'s? and O? But ""NOEET"" is not a word.\n\n""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.\n\nThis has N in 1st, O in 2nd? But we need E in 2nd? So no.\n\nWe need E in 2nd? So ""N E _ _ T"" -> then we have E in 2nd? Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters.\n\nSo ""N E L O T"" (if we avoid repeat O? ""N E L O T"" has O in 4th? and T in 5th? But T is already known? So we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that N is in 3rd? So let\'s try to cover both.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in 3rd? But we don\'t have a good example.\n\nAnother word for N in 3rd: we need E in 1st or 2nd.\n\nIf E in 1st: then word is E _ N _ T.\n\nExamples: ""E I N T"" -> ""EINT"" not a word.\n\n""E O N T"" -> ""EONT"" not a word.\n\n""E U N T"" -> ""EUNT"" not a word.\n\n""ELINT"" not a word.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with N in 3rd? So maybe N in 1st is more promising.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that E is in 3rd? So if we put N in 1st and E in 3rd? Then word: N _ E _ T.\n\nExamples: ""N I E T"" not a word.\n\n""N O E T T"" not a word.\n\n""N O V E T"" -> ""NOVET"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.\n\nThis has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But wait, we know E is not in 4th? So we cannot put E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.\n\nSo ""NOVET"" is N-O-V-E-T -> E is in 4th? Which we know is not allowed? So we should avoid.\n\nSo back to ""N E L O T"": N-E-L-O-T.\n\nThis tests:\n- N in 1st: if it\'s correct, we get ✓ for N? If not, then we know N is in 3rd? Because we have tested 1st and 2nd? And 2nd is E? But we might test E in 3rd later.\n\nBut we also have E in 2nd? So we can test E in 2nd.\n\nSo I think ""N E L O T"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we are testing L and O? And we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that the word has E in 3rd? So if we don\'t test E in 3rd, we might miss.\n\nBut we can test E in 3rd in the next guess if needed.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""N E L O T"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ""N E L O T""\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""N I E T"" is not a word.\n\n""N O E T T"" is not a word.\n\n""N O V E T"" is a word (a type of vaccine) -> N-O-V-E-T.\n\nThis has N in 1st, O in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th? But we know E is not in 4th? So we should avoid putting E in 4th? So ""NOVET"" has E in 4th? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid.\n\nSo ""N E L O T"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check: ""N E L O T"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical instrument.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""N E L O T"".\n\nBut note: we are putting N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can test both.\n\nSo guess: ""N E L O T""\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters? We know C,R,A,U,S are absent? So ""N E L O T"" has N,E,L,O,T -> no forbidden letters? L and O are new.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.\n\nBut note: we have T at the end? So we know T is correct? So in the feedback, T will be ✓.\n\nWe are testing N in 1st and E in 2nd? So we can get information about N and E\'s positions.\n\nBut we also have L and O? So we test them.\n\nSo I think ""N E L O T"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""N E L O T"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- C, R, A, U, S are absent from the secret word.\n- N is present but not in position 4 (from CRANE) or 2 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1 or 3.\n- E is present but not in position 5 (from CRANE) or 4 (from UNSET), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- T is present and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ T\n\nFor the next guess, I need to test possible positions for N and E while avoiding forbidden letters. I chose ""N E L O T"" because:\n- It places N in position 1 (a possible location) and E in position 2 (a possible location for E).\n- It tests new common letters (L and O) to gather more information.\n- It avoids repeating known absent letters (C, R, A, U, S) and forbidden positions for N and E.\n\nThis guess will help identify the correct positions of N and E and reveal if L or O are in the word.\n\n<guess>NELOT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNSET -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(✓)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 5: NELOT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) L(x) O(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
- C, R, A are absent.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: UNSET -> U(x), N(-), S(x), E(-), T(✓)
- U and S are absent.
- N is present but not in position 2 (since we guessed N in 2nd and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
- E is present but not in position 4 (we guessed E in 4th and got '-') and also not in position 5 (from first guess).
- T is present and in the correct position (position 5).

Guess 3: NELOT -> N(✓), E(✓), L(x), O(x), T(✓)
- N is in the correct position (1st).
- E is in the correct position (2nd).
- L is absent.
- O is absent.
- T is in the correct position (5th).

So, from Guess 3, we know:
- The first letter is N.
- The second letter is E.
- The fifth letter is T.
- The word does not contain L or O.

Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain C, R, A, U, S.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: N E _ _ T

We need to find the third and fourth letters.

Constraints:
- The third and fourth letters cannot be L or O (since they are absent).
- They cannot be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, U, S, L, O.

We also know that N and E are in the word, but we already have them in positions 1 and 2, so they are fixed there.

So the word is: N E ? ? T

We need to find two letters for positions 3 and 4 that are not in the set {C, R, A, U, S, L, O}.

We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

But note: we have two positions to fill, and we can test two new letters.

We can try a word that has common consonants and vowels in the third and fourth positions.

Possible words: 
- ""NEIST"" (a word, meaning a unit of weight or currency) -> N E I S T -> but S is absent? We know S is absent from Guess 2 (UNSET: S(x)), so we cannot use S.
- ""NEEDY"" -> N E E D Y -> has two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated? Also, D and Y are new.
- ""NEAPS"" -> has A and S? Absent -> invalid.
- ""NEERI"" -> N E E R I -> has two E's and R? R is absent? So invalid.
- ""NEIST"" -> N E I S T -> has S? Absent -> invalid.
- ""NEIST"" is invalid because of S.

Let's think of words without the forbidden letters.

We need words that start with ""NE"", end with ""T"", and have two letters in the middle that are not C,R,A,U,S,L,O.

Common words:
- ""NEEDY"": N E E D Y -> but has two E's? We don't know if E is repeated? But we can try? However, we have E in 2nd and then E again in 3rd? But we don't know if the word has two E's? So it might be acceptable? But we can also try without repeats.

- ""NEIST"" is invalid.

- ""NEPT"" is 4 letters.

- ""NERDY"" -> N E R D Y -> has R? Absent -> invalid.

- ""NEEDY"" is valid? But let's see: N E E D Y -> positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E, 4:D, 5:Y.

But we are testing E in 3rd? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated? So we can try? But we might get less information.

- ""NEEDY"" uses E in 3rd and D in 4th? And Y in 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? But here E is in 3rd? So that's okay? But we are testing D and Y? And we are putting E in 3rd? Which might be useful.

But note: we have two E's? So if the secret word has only one E, we might get feedback that one E is correct and the other is absent? Or if both are present? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E in the third position.

- ""NEATO"" -> has A? Absent -> invalid.

- ""NEAPS"" -> has A and S? Absent -> invalid.

- ""NEIST"" -> has S? Absent -> invalid.

- ""NEEDY"" is the only one I can think of with E in 3rd? But let's try without E in 3rd.

- ""NEEDY"" might be acceptable? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""NEPT"" is 4 letters.

- ""NEVUS"" -> has U and S? Absent -> invalid.

- ""NEWET"" -> has E and W? But E is at position 1? But we have N at position 1? So no, the first letter is N, so ""NEWET"" would be N E W E T -> but that's 5 letters? Positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:T. But we have E in 4th? We know E is not in 4th? So we should avoid.

- ""NEWPT"" -> not a word.

- ""NEWPT"" is not a word.

- ""NEWLY"" -> N E W L Y -> but L is absent? From Guess 3, L is absent? So we cannot use L.

- ""NEWLY"" has L? Absent -> invalid.
