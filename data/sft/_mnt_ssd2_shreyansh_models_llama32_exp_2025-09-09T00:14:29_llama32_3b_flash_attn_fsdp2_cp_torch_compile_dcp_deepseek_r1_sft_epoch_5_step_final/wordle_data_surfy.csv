First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I'll get feedback on these frequent letters.

""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it's acceptable in Wordle.

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step within </think> tags, and then output the guess in the specified format.

So, step-by-step thoughts:
- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.

Then, output the guess in the format: <guess>RAISE</guess>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    - R was in position 1, but it's not in position 1 in the secret word.
    - S was in position 4, but it's not in position 4 in the secret word.
- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).
- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Since R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.

Possible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.

Let's think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Common letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).

We also want to test new positions for R and S.

For example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.

So in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).

Let's try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Also, we want to cover more common letters. Let's try to include T, N, O, L, etc.

One common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let's check:
- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.

So ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" - but that's not common. Let's think of common words.

How about ""SPORT""? 
- S at position 1: that's a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That's allowed.
- P, O, T are new letters.

But note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let's see:
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 5: T

Yes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).

But we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.

Also, we avoid A,I,E.

So ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.
- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.
- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.

We can also consider other words.

Another common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).
- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let's see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). 
But wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it's wrong and we'll get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.

Therefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) 
- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.

Also, we can test T, U, N.

But is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.

But let me check if there are other options.

We know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.

We can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.

Let me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Possible words:
- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.
- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.
- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.
- CURRY: but has double R? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R's and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R's? But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

But note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R's, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R's, we might get both marked appropriately.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates to get clearer information.

So let's go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship's hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.

""SPORT"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We also test P, O, T.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

For example, we haven't tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.

We can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.

Let me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.

How about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don't know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don't know.

But let's stick to words without duplicates for now.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

A more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, K.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it's common and uses P, O, T which are common.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven't tested and that are more likely? But we don't have much information.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.

Let me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5
For S: 1,2,3,5

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.

For example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.

Similarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.

So we must avoid A,I,E.

Let me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? 
For example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.

How about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).
- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).
- We avoid A,I,E.

Also, we test C, U, B.

But note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.

So ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at 3 (ok).
- S is at 5 (ok).

We test C, U, B.

But we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.

How about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.

""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test P, O, T.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? 
For R: we know it's not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so it's ok.
For S: we know it's not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that's a new position, so ok.

So I'll go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.

Another word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.

""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, U, N.

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

But let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.

So I'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.

Also, we test P, O, T.

So let's go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. So we are testing O.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.

Word: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, N.

But ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.

But I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

I'll choose ""SPORT"".

So the second guess is ""SPORT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Excludes A, I, E.
- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.

I considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.

<guess>SPORT</guess>",SPORT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    - R was in position 1, but it's not in position 1 in the secret word.
    - S was in position 4, but it's not in position 4 in the secret word.
- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).
- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Since R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.

Possible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.

Let's think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Common letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).

We also want to test new positions for R and S.

For example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.

So in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).

Let's try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Also, we want to cover more common letters. Let's try to include T, N, O, L, etc.

One common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let's check:
- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.

So ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" - but that's not common. Let's think of common words.

How about ""SPORT""? 
- S at position 1: that's a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That's allowed.
- P, O, T are new letters.

But note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let's see:
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 5: T

Yes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).

But we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.

Also, we avoid A,I,E.

So ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.
- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.
- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.

We can also consider other words.

Another common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).
- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let's see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). 
But wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it's wrong and we'll get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.

Therefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) 
- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.

Also, we can test T, U, N.

But is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.

But let me check if there are other options.

We know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.

We can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.

Let me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Possible words:
- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.
- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.
- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.
- CURRY: but has double R? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R's and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R's? But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

But note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R's, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R's, we might get both marked appropriately.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates to get clearer information.

So let's go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship's hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.

""SPORT"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We also test P, O, T.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

For example, we haven't tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.

We can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.

Let me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.

How about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don't know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don't know.

But let's stick to words without duplicates for now.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

A more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, K.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it's common and uses P, O, T which are common.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven't tested and that are more likely? But we don't have much information.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.

Let me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5
For S: 1,2,3,5

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.

For example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.

Similarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.

So we must avoid A,I,E.

Let me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? 
For example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.

How about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).
- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).
- We avoid A,I,E.

Also, we test C, U, B.

But note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.

So ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at 3 (ok).
- S is at 5 (ok).

We test C, U, B.

But we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.

How about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.

""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test P, O, T.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? 
For R: we know it's not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so it's ok.
For S: we know it's not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that's a new position, so ok.

So I'll go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.

Another word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.

""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, U, N.

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

But let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.

So I'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.

Also, we test P, O, T.

So let's go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. So we are testing O.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.

Word: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, N.

But ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.

But I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

I'll choose ""SPORT"".

So the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Excludes A, I, E.
- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.

I considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.",Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I'll get feedback on these frequent letters.

""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it's acceptable in Wordle.

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.

So, step-by-step thoughts:
- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.

Then, output the guess in the format:

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    - R was in position 1, but it's not in position 1 in the secret word.
    - S was in position 4, but it's not in position 4 in the secret word.
- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).
- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Since R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.

Possible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.

Let's think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Common letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).

We also want to test new positions for R and S.

For example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.

So in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).

Let's try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Also, we want to cover more common letters. Let's try to include T, N, O, L, etc.

One common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let's check:
- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.

So ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" - but that's not common. Let's think of common words.

How about ""SPORT""? 
- S at position 1: that's a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That's allowed.
- P, O, T are new letters.

But note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let's see:
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 5: T

Yes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).

But we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.

Also, we avoid A,I,E.

So ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.
- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.
- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.

We can also consider other words.

Another common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).
- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let's see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). 
But wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it's wrong and we'll get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.

Therefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) 
- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.

Also, we can test T, U, N.

But is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.

But let me check if there are other options.

We know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.

We can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.

Let me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Possible words:
- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.
- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.
- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.
- CURRY: but has double R? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R's and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R's? But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

But note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R's, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R's, we might get both marked appropriately.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates to get clearer information.

So let's go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship's hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.

""SPORT"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We also test P, O, T.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

For example, we haven't tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.

We can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.

Let me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.

How about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don't know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don't know.

But let's stick to words without duplicates for now.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

A more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, K.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it's common and uses P, O, T which are common.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven't tested and that are more likely? But we don't have much information.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.

Let me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5
For S: 1,2,3,5

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.

For example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.

Similarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.

So we must avoid A,I,E.

Let me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? 
For example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.

How about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).
- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).
- We avoid A,I,E.

Also, we test C, U, B.

But note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.

So ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at 3 (ok).
- S is at 5 (ok).

We test C, U, B.

But we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.

How about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.

""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test P, O, T.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? 
For R: we know it's not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so it's ok.
For S: we know it's not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that's a new position, so ok.

So I'll go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.

Another word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.

""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, U, N.

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

But let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.

So I'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.

Also, we test P, O, T.

So let's go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. So we are testing O.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.

Word: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, N.

But ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.

But I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

I'll choose ""SPORT"".

So the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Excludes A, I, E.
- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.

I considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.

That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.\n\nIn Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.\n\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U.

Specifically:\n    - R was in position 1, but it\'s not in position 1 in the secret word.\n    - S was in position 4, but it\'s not in position 4 in the secret word.\n- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters long.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).\n- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).\n- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.\n\nSince R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.\n\nCommon letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).\n\nWe also want to test new positions for R and S.\n\nFor example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nAlso, we want to cover more common letters. Let\'s try to include T, N, O, L, etc.\n\nOne common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let\'s check:\n- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.\n\nSo ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" - but that\'s not common. Let\'s think of common words.\n\nHow about ""SPORT""? \n- S at position 1: that\'s a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That\'s allowed.\n- P, O, T are new letters.\n\nBut note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let\'s see:\nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: P\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: T\n\nYes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).\n\nBut we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.\n\nAlso, we avoid A,I,E.\n\nSo ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if it meets the criteria:\n- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.\n- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.\n- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).\n- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let\'s see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). \nBut wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it\'s in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it\'s wrong and we\'ll get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) \n- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.\n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we can test T, U, N.\n\nBut is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me check if there are other options.\n\nWe know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.\n- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.\n- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.\n- CURRY: but has double R? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R\'s and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don\'t know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R\'s, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R\'s, we might get both marked appropriately.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to get clearer information.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship\'s hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.\n\n""SPORT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe also test P, O, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and also includes other common letters.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.\n\nWe can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.\n\nLet me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nHow about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don\'t know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nA more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, K.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it\'s common and uses P, O, T which are common.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and that are more likely? But we don\'t have much information.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.\n\nLet me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5\nFor S: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.\n\nFor example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.\n\nSo we must avoid A,I,E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? \nFor example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.\n\nHow about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).\n- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).\n- We avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we test C, U, B.\n\nBut note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.\n\nSo ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at 3 (ok).\n- S is at 5 (ok).\n\nWe test C, U, B.\n\nBut we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence for that.\n\nI think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.\n\nHow about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.\n\n""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test P, O, T.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? \nFor R: we know it\'s not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so it\'s ok.\nFor S: we know it\'s not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that\'s a new position, so ok.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. But we are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.\n\n""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, U, N.\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""SPORT"".\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1?

Yes, meaning to disturb.\n\nBut I think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SPORT"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the word but not at position 1.\n- S is in the word but not at position 4.\n- A, I, E are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.\n- Excludes A, I, E.\n- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.\n\nI considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
- S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not at position 4.
- P, O, T are not in the word.

From Guess 2, we know that S is at position 1 (because S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1). So the secret word starts with S.

Also, R is in the word but not at position 4 (from Guess 1) and not at position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be in one of positions 2,3,5.

Now, we know the word starts with S and contains R (but not at position 4) and does not contain A, I, E, P, O, T.

We must avoid letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We know the word has R and S (and we know S is at position 1).

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with S (since S is fixed at position 1).
- Contains R in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not contain A, I, E, P, O, T.
- We can include other common letters to test.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover more common letters: like N, L, U, C, D, M, etc.

We also know that R must be in positions 2,3, or 5 (but not 4, and not 1 because that's S).

Possible positions for R:
- Position 2: e.g., S?R???
- Position 3: e.g., S?R??
- Position 5: e.g., S??R?

We need to test which position R is in and also find the other letters.

Let's think of words that start with S and have R in one of the allowed positions.

For example, with R in position 2: words like ""SCRUB"", ""SCRUM"", ""SCREW"", ""SHRUB"", etc. But we must avoid A,I,E,P,O,T.

""SCRUB"" has C,R,U,B -> avoids forbidden letters? Let's check: no A,I,E,P,O,T. But we don't know about U and B.

Similarly, ""SCREW"" has S,C,R,E,W -> but E is forbidden! So avoid E.

""SHRUB"" has S,H,R,U,B -> avoids forbidden letters? H,R,U,B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. But note: we have R at position 3? In ""SHRUB"", S is at 1, H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5. But we know R must be in the word and not at position 4? Here it's at 3, which is allowed.

But we also need to consider that in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1, so that's consistent.

Now, we need to choose a word that can give us more information.

We know the word has R and S (and S at start). We need to find the other three letters.

We can try a word that has R in a new position and tests other common letters.

For example, let's try to put R at position 3. Then we can test other common consonants and vowels.

But note: we have only one vowel so far? The word starts with S, and we have R and then three more letters. We don't know if there are more vowels? The word might have U or another vowel? But we know A,I,E are out.

We can try a word like ""SCUR?"" but we need to avoid E? E is forbidden.

Let me list possible words:

- With R at position 2: S?R??? 
  Possible words: SCRUB, SCRUM, SCREW (invalid due to E), SHIRK, SHIRT, SHARK, SKIRT, SLURP, SLURM, etc.

- With R at position 3: S?R??? 
  Possible words: SHARK, SHIRT, SKIRT, SLURP, SLURM, SCOUR (but O is forbidden? O is forbidden because of Guess 2: O is absent), SCOUR has O -> invalid.

  Without forbidden letters: SHARK, SHIRT, SKIRT, SLURP, SLURM.

- With R at position 5: S???R? 
  Possible words: SHIR? but R at 5: S? ? R -> e.g., SHIRR (but R is at 5? and we have I? no, SHIRR: S,H,I,R,R -> but I is forbidden! So avoid I. Also, we have two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's.

  Without forbidden letters: SHO?R? -> SHORE? but O and E forbidden -> invalid. 
  SHO?R? with no A,I,E,P,O,T: SHUR? not a word. SHYR? not a word. 
  How about ""SHRUG"": S,H,R,U,G -> avoids forbidden letters? H,R,U,G -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. And R is at position 3? In ""SHRUG"": S(1),H(2),R(3),U(4),G(5). 
  But note: we have R at position 3? That's allowed. And we test H,U,G.

  Also, ""SHRUG"" is a valid word.

  Similarly, ""SKR?R?"": not common. 
  ""SLUR?R?"": SLURP, SLURM, etc.

But we have many possibilities.

We need to choose a word that can help us narrow down the possibilities.

We know the word has S at 1, R in the word (at 2,3, or 5), and does not have A,I,E,P,O,T.

We can try ""SHRUG"" to test H,U,G.

But note: we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong position. Now we have S at position 1, so that's consistent.

Another idea: we can try a word that has R in position 3 and also tests other common letters.

But let's see: we have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a good candidate because it tests H,U,G and places R at position 3.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""SHIRT"" -> S,H,I,R,T -> but I and T are forbidden! T is forbidden because of Guess 2: T is absent.

Similarly, ""SHARK"" has A? no, SHARK: S,H,A,R,K -> A is forbidden! So invalid.

""SHRUG"" seems okay: S,H,R,U,G -> avoids forbidden letters? H: allowed, U: allowed, G: allowed. And R is at position 3.

But we also have to consider that the word might have U or other vowels? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 2? 

For example, ""SCRUM"": S,C,R,U,M -> avoids forbidden letters? C: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed. And R at position 3? In ""SCRUM"": S(1),C(2),R(3),U(4),M(5). 
But note: we have R at position 3? That's allowed.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong position. Now we have S at position 1, so that's fine.

But let's compare: ""SHRUG"" and ""SCRUM"" and ""SCRUM"" has C and U and M.

We can also try ""SLURP"": S,L,U,R,P -> but P is forbidden! So invalid.

""SLURM"": S,L,U,R,M -> avoids forbidden letters? L,U,R,M -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. And R at position 4? In ""SLURM"": S(1),L(2),U(3),R(4),M(5). 
But wait: in Guess 2, we had R at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. So R cannot be at position 4? Therefore, in the secret word, R is not at position 4. So we cannot put R at position 4 in our guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but we know it's not at 4, so we might get a '-' again? But that doesn't give new information. So we should avoid position 4 for R.

In ""SLURM"", R is at position 4 -> avoid because we know R is not at position 4.

So we must avoid putting R at position 4.

Therefore, ""SLURM"" is invalid because it puts R at 4.

Similarly, we must avoid putting R at 4.

So back to ""SHRUG"": R is at position 3 -> good.

Another word: ""SHRUG"" is S,H,R,U,G -> R at 3 -> good.

Or ""SHRUB"": S,H,R,U,B -> same.

But let's choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? 

For example, ""S? ? ? R"": e.g., ""SHYR?"": not a word. ""SHORR"": not common. ""SHOGR"": not a word. 
""SHO?R?"": ""SHORR"" invalid. ""SHURR"": not common. 
""S? ? ?R"": ""SHIRK"" has I -> invalid. ""SHOGR"" not a word. 
""SWIRR"": not common. 
""SWO?R"": ""SWOOP"" has O and P -> invalid. 
""SWIRL"": S,W,I,R,L -> I is forbidden -> invalid. 
""SWO?R"": ""SWOON"" has O and N -> O forbidden -> invalid. 
""SWO?R"": ""SWOON"" invalid. 
""SWIRR"" invalid.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 08 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I'll get feedback on these frequent letters.

""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it's acceptable in Wordle.

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.

So, step-by-step thoughts:
- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.

Then, output the guess in the format:

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    - R was in position 1, but it's not in position 1 in the secret word.
    - S was in position 4, but it's not in position 4 in the secret word.
- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).
- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Since R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.

Possible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.

Let's think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Common letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).

We also want to test new positions for R and S.

For example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.

So in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).

Let's try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Also, we want to cover more common letters. Let's try to include T, N, O, L, etc.

One common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let's check:
- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.

So ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" - but that's not common. Let's think of common words.

How about ""SPORT""? 
- S at position 1: that's a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That's allowed.
- P, O, T are new letters.

But note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let's see:
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 5: T

Yes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).

But we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.

Also, we avoid A,I,E.

So ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.
- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.
- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.

We can also consider other words.

Another common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).
- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let's see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). 
But wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it's wrong and we'll get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.

Therefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) 
- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.

Also, we can test T, U, N.

But is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.

But let me check if there are other options.

We know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.

We can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.

Let me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Possible words:
- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.
- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.
- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.
- CURRY: but has double R? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R's and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R's? But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

But note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R's, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R's, we might get both marked appropriately.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates to get clearer information.

So let's go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship's hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.

""SPORT"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We also test P, O, T.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

For example, we haven't tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.

We can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.

Let me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.

How about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don't know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don't know.

But let's stick to words without duplicates for now.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

A more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, K.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it's common and uses P, O, T which are common.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven't tested and that are more likely? But we don't have much information.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.

Let me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5
For S: 1,2,3,5

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.

For example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.

Similarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.

So we must avoid A,I,E.

Let me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? 
For example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.

How about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).
- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).
- We avoid A,I,E.

Also, we test C, U, B.

But note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.

So ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at 3 (ok).
- S is at 5 (ok).

We test C, U, B.

But we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.

How about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.

""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test P, O, T.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? 
For R: we know it's not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so it's ok.
For S: we know it's not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that's a new position, so ok.

So I'll go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.

Another word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.

""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, U, N.

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

But let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.

So I'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.

Also, we test P, O, T.

So let's go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. So we are testing O.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.

Word: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, N.

But ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.

But I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

I'll choose ""SPORT"".

So the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Excludes A, I, E.
- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.

I considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.\n\nIn Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.\n\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.\n\nA popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.\n\nI need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I\'ll get feedback on these frequent letters.\n\n""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it\'s acceptable in Wordle.\n\nNow, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.\n\nSo, step-by-step thoughts:\n- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.\n- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.\n\nThen, output the guess in the format:\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.\n- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.\n- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:\n    - R was in position 1, but it\'s not in position 1 in the secret word.\n    - S was in position 4, but it\'s not in position 4 in the secret word.\n- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters long.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).\n- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).\n- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.\n\nSince R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.\n\nCommon letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).\n\nWe also want to test new positions for R and S.\n\nFor example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nAlso, we want to cover more common letters. Let\'s try to include T, N, O, L, etc.\n\nOne common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let\'s check:\n- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.\n\nSo ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" - but that\'s not common. Let\'s think of common words.\n\nHow about ""SPORT""? \n- S at position 1: that\'s a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That\'s allowed.\n- P, O, T are new letters.\n\nBut note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let\'s see:\nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: P\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: T\n\nYes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).\n\nBut we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.\n\nAlso, we avoid A,I,E.\n\nSo ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if it meets the criteria:\n- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.\n- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.\n- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).\n- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let\'s see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). \nBut wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it\'s in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it\'s wrong and we\'ll get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) \n- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.\n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we can test T, U, N.\n\nBut is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me check if there are other options.\n\nWe know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.\n- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.\n- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.\n- CURRY: but has double R? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R\'s and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don\'t know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R\'s, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R\'s, we might get both marked appropriately.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to get clearer information.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship\'s hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.\n\n""SPORT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe also test P, O, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and also includes other common letters.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.\n\nWe can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.\n\nLet me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nHow about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don\'t know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nA more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, K.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it\'s common and uses P, O, T which are common.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and that are more likely? But we don\'t have much information.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.\n\nLet me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5\nFor S: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.\n\nFor example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.\n\nSo we must avoid A,I,E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? \nFor example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.\n\nHow about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).\n- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).\n- We avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we test C, U, B.\n\nBut note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.\n\nSo ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at 3 (ok).\n- S is at 5 (ok).\n\nWe test C, U, B.\n\nBut we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence for that.\n\nI think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.\n\nHow about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.\n\n""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test P, O, T.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? \nFor R: we know it\'s not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so it\'s ok.\nFor S: we know it\'s not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that\'s a new position, so ok.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. But we are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.\n\n""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, U, N.\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""SPORT"".\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.\n\nAlso, we test P, O, T.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. So we are testing O.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.\n\nWord: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, N.\n\nBut ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.\n\nBut I think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SPORT"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the word but not at position 1.\n- S is in the word but not at position 4.\n- A, I, E are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.\n- Excludes A, I, E.\n- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.\n\nI considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: absent

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)
- P: absent
- O: absent
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 4)
- T: absent

So, from all this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters R and S (and we know they are not at the positions we guessed).
2. The secret word does not have A, I, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the positions:
- S is fixed at position 1 (because in SPORT, S is at position 1 and it's correct).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we know it's not at position 1 from the first guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _

We know:
- Position 1: must be S (because S is correct at position 1 in the second guess).

So the word starts with S.

- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 5 is available for R? Yes, because we haven't tested R at position 5 yet.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we know S and R are in the word, but we don't know the other two).

We must avoid the letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We can use other common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R (at position 2,3, or 5) and the other R? (we don't know if there are duplicates, but we'll avoid for now).
- Does not contain A,I,E,P,O,T.

Also, we should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- Position 2: then the word is S R _ _ _
- Position 3: then word is S _ R _ _
- Position 5: then word is S _ _ _ R

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these possibilities and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that start with S and have R in one of the positions 2,3,5, but avoiding the forbidden letters.

Common letters to test: L, N, U, D, C, etc.

We also note that the word must have two more letters (since we have S and R, and three more letters total? Actually, we know the word has R and S, and two more letters that are not A,I,E,P,O,T).

But we don't know the other letters. We should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent: A,I,E,P,O,T.

So let's try to form a word that starts with S, has R in position 2,3, or 5, and uses new letters.

Option 1: put R at position 2. Then the word is S R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicates, but in the example, there were no duplicates. However, we should avoid using R and S again in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for S.

But to maximize information, we should try new letters. So for the third and fourth positions, we can use new letters, and for the fifth, we can use R? But we don't know if R is at position 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid R and S in the positions we are testing? But we need to use them elsewhere.

But note: we have only two known letters: S and R. So we should include both? Actually, we can use one of them only if we have to, but we want to test new letters.

But we must include R and S because we know they are in the word? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without R or S? But we know they are in the word, so if we don't include them, we might not get information about their positions. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

We can use a word that includes R and S in positions we haven't ruled out, and then test new letters in the other positions.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, with R at position 2: S R _ _ _
We need to fill with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). Also, the letters must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S(1), R(2), C(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. But we have to check if it's valid. Yes, ""scrub"" is a word.
- ""SERUM"": S(1), R(2), E(3) -> but E is forbidden! We know E is absent. So avoid.
- ""SERUM"" has E -> invalid.
- ""SHRUB"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, B are new. Valid word.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.
- ""SKRIM"": S(1), R(2), K(3), I(4) -> but I is forbidden! We know I is absent. So avoid.
- ""SLURP"": S(1), R(2), L(3), U(4), P(5) -> P is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SWIRL"": S(1), R(2), W(3), I(4) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.

So without I and P, we have:
- ""SCRUB"": S, R, C, U, B -> all new letters? C, U, B are new. And no forbidden letters.
- ""SHRUB"": S, R, H, U, B -> H, U, B new.
- ""SHRUG"": S, R, H, U, G -> H, U, G new.
- ""SKRIM"": invalid because of I.
- ""SLURP"": invalid because of P and I.
- ""SWIRL"": invalid because of I.

Also, with R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need to fill the first two and last positions? Actually, positions 1 and 2 are fixed as S and then a letter, then R at 3.

Possible words:
- ""SNORT"": S(1), N(2), O(3) -> O is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""STERN"": S(1), T(2) -> T is forbidden? T is absent, so we cannot use T. And E is also forbidden. So avoid.
- ""SHIRT"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SCARF"": S(1), C(2), A(3) -> A and I are forbidden? A and I are absent, so avoid.
- ""SCUR"": only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Actually, ""SCUR"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""SHARD"": S(1), H(2), A(3) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHIRE"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
Possible words:
- ""SANDY"": S(1), A(2) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have S at 1 and then U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. But we know S is at 1, so that's fixed. Then R at 5 is a new position. But we have to avoid A,I,E,P,O,T. So ""SUNNY"" is S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have two N's? That's acceptable? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are testing U and N.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we can try without duplicates.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We need to place them in positions that are not ruled out and test new letters.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and then test common consonants and vowels (but vowels are limited: we know A,I,E are absent, so only O,U (and Y) are left? And sometimes W, etc.).

But we have U and O? We know O is absent, so we cannot use O. So we are left with U and Y (as vowel).

So for the word with R at position 2: S R U _ _ ? But we need a 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S R U C B -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S R U H B -> H, B new. Valid.
- ""SHRUG"": S R U H G -> H, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"" and ""SHRUG"" are similar.

With R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need a vowel? We have U? But we can try.

Possible words:
- ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> H, U, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S H R U B -> H, U, B new. Valid.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
We need a vowel? U is available.

Possible words:
- ""SUNNY"": S U N N Y -> U, N, Y new. But note: we have two N's? And we don't know if N is in the word. Also, Y is a vowel? But we can try. But we have U and N.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests C, U, B.

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? That might be less common.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We can try to put R at position 2 and then test common letters.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

But let me check: the secret word has S at position 1 and R somewhere else. In ""SCRUB"", we put R at position 2 and U at 4, B at 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for R. So maybe we should test R at position 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SHRUG"" has R at position 3? Let me see: S H R U G -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:U, 5:G. So R is at position 3.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" has R at position 3.

So both are valid.

But ""SHRUG"" tests H, U, G.

We can also consider ""SHRUB"" for the same.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are safe.

I think ""SHRUB"" is a good choice because it tests H, U, B.

But let's see: we have S at 1, then H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We know R is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we know R is not at position 3.

Similarly, we test H, U, B.

So let's go with ""SHRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 2? Then ""SHRUB"" or ""SHRUG"" would test R at position 3? But we are not testing position 2? Actually, in ""SHRUB"", R is at position 3, so we are not testing position 2.

We need to test position 2? We can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 2? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SCRUB"" has R at 2.

So let's choose ""SCRUB"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

So the third guess is ""SCRUB"".

But let me double-check: 
- S at 1: we know S is at 1, so it will be ✓.
- R at 2: we are testing if R is at 2.
- C at 3: new letter.
- U at 4: new vowel? We know A,I,E are absent, so U is okay.
- B at 5: new letter.

So we'll get feedback on all these.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what if the word has R at position 5? Then ""SCRUB"" would have R at 2? That might be wrong. But we are testing R at 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SUNNY"" has R at 5? But it has U and N? And N is common.

But ""SUNNY"" has U and N? And avoids forbidden letters? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5). But we have two N's? That might be confusing? But the feedback will mark each letter separately.

But we are testing: U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. Also, we are testing if N is in the word and if U is in the word.

But we don't know if the word has U or N.

But we can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two S's? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that S is present but wrong position? But we already know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, and if the word has only one S, then we'll get a '-' for S at 5? But if the word has two S's, then we might get a check for S at 5? But we don't know.

But to avoid complexity, let's stick with ""SCRUB"".

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SCRUB"" has S, R, C, U, B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. Good.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

So <guess>SCRUB</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S is correct at position 1).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- The letters A, I, E, P, O, T are absent.

For the third guess, I need to test the position of R and also test new common letters. I chose ""SCRUB"" because:
- It starts with S (which we know is correct).
- It places R at position 2 (a position we haven't tested for R) to check if R is there.
- It uses new letters (C, U, B) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, I, E, P, O, T).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- S at position 1: should be ✓ (correct).
- R at position 2: if correct, we get a check; if not, we know R is not at position 2.
- C at position 3: if present and correct, we get a check; if present but wrong position, we get '-'; if absent, we get 'x'.
- U at position 4: same.
- B at position 5: same.

This will give us information about the positions of R and the presence of C, U, B.

<guess>SCRUB</guess>",SCRUB,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: absent

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)
- P: absent
- O: absent
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 4)
- T: absent

So, from all this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters R and S (and we know they are not at the positions we guessed).
2. The secret word does not have A, I, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the positions:
- S is fixed at position 1 (because in SPORT, S is at position 1 and it's correct).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we know it's not at position 1 from the first guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _

We know:
- Position 1: must be S (because S is correct at position 1 in the second guess).

So the word starts with S.

- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 5 is available for R? Yes, because we haven't tested R at position 5 yet.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we know S and R are in the word, but we don't know the other two).

We must avoid the letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We can use other common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R (at position 2,3, or 5) and the other R? (we don't know if there are duplicates, but we'll avoid for now).
- Does not contain A,I,E,P,O,T.

Also, we should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- Position 2: then the word is S R _ _ _
- Position 3: then word is S _ R _ _
- Position 5: then word is S _ _ _ R

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these possibilities and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that start with S and have R in one of the positions 2,3,5, but avoiding the forbidden letters.

Common letters to test: L, N, U, D, C, etc.

We also note that the word must have two more letters (since we have S and R, and three more letters total? Actually, we know the word has R and S, and two more letters that are not A,I,E,P,O,T).

But we don't know the other letters. We should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent: A,I,E,P,O,T.

So let's try to form a word that starts with S, has R in position 2,3, or 5, and uses new letters.

Option 1: put R at position 2. Then the word is S R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicates, but in the example, there were no duplicates. However, we should avoid using R and S again in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for S.

But to maximize information, we should try new letters. So for the third and fourth positions, we can use new letters, and for the fifth, we can use R? But we don't know if R is at position 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid R and S in the positions we are testing? But we need to use them elsewhere.

But note: we have only two known letters: S and R. So we should include both? Actually, we can use one of them only if we have to, but we want to test new letters.

But we must include R and S because we know they are in the word? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without R or S? But we know they are in the word, so if we don't include them, we might not get information about their positions. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

We can use a word that includes R and S in positions we haven't ruled out, and then test new letters in the other positions.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, with R at position 2: S R _ _ _
We need to fill with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). Also, the letters must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S(1), R(2), C(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. But we have to check if it's valid. Yes, ""scrub"" is a word.
- ""SERUM"": S(1), R(2), E(3) -> but E is forbidden! We know E is absent. So avoid.
- ""SERUM"" has E -> invalid.
- ""SHRUB"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, B are new. Valid word.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.
- ""SKRIM"": S(1), R(2), K(3), I(4) -> but I is forbidden! We know I is absent. So avoid.
- ""SLURP"": S(1), R(2), L(3), U(4), P(5) -> P is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SWIRL"": S(1), R(2), W(3), I(4) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.

So without I and P, we have:
- ""SCRUB"": S, R, C, U, B -> all new letters? C, U, B are new. And no forbidden letters.
- ""SHRUB"": S, R, H, U, B -> H, U, B new.
- ""SHRUG"": S, R, H, U, G -> H, U, G new.
- ""SKRIM"": invalid because of I.
- ""SLURP"": invalid because of P and I.
- ""SWIRL"": invalid because of I.

Also, with R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need to fill the first two and last positions? Actually, positions 1 and 2 are fixed as S and then a letter, then R at 3.

Possible words:
- ""SNORT"": S(1), N(2), O(3) -> O is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""STERN"": S(1), T(2) -> T is forbidden? T is absent, so we cannot use T. And E is also forbidden. So avoid.
- ""SHIRT"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SCARF"": S(1), C(2), A(3) -> A and I are forbidden? A and I are absent, so avoid.
- ""SCUR"": only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Actually, ""SCUR"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""SHARD"": S(1), H(2), A(3) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHIRE"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
Possible words:
- ""SANDY"": S(1), A(2) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have S at 1 and then U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. But we know S is at 1, so that's fixed. Then R at 5 is a new position. But we have to avoid A,I,E,P,O,T. So ""SUNNY"" is S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have two N's? That's acceptable? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are testing U and N.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we can try without duplicates.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We need to place them in positions that are not ruled out and test new letters.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and then test common consonants and vowels (but vowels are limited: we know A,I,E are absent, so only O,U (and Y) are left? And sometimes W, etc.).

But we have U and O? We know O is absent, so we cannot use O. So we are left with U and Y (as vowel).

So for the word with R at position 2: S R U _ _ ? But we need a 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S R U C B -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S R U H B -> H, B new. Valid.
- ""SHRUG"": S R U H G -> H, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"" and ""SHRUG"" are similar.

With R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need a vowel? We have U? But we can try.

Possible words:
- ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> H, U, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S H R U B -> H, U, B new. Valid.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
We need a vowel? U is available.

Possible words:
- ""SUNNY"": S U N N Y -> U, N, Y new. But note: we have two N's? And we don't know if N is in the word. Also, Y is a vowel? But we can try. But we have U and N.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests C, U, B.

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? That might be less common.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We can try to put R at position 2 and then test common letters.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

But let me check: the secret word has S at position 1 and R somewhere else. In ""SCRUB"", we put R at position 2 and U at 4, B at 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for R. So maybe we should test R at position 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SHRUG"" has R at position 3? Let me see: S H R U G -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:U, 5:G. So R is at position 3.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" has R at position 3.

So both are valid.

But ""SHRUG"" tests H, U, G.

We can also consider ""SHRUB"" for the same.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are safe.

I think ""SHRUB"" is a good choice because it tests H, U, B.

But let's see: we have S at 1, then H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We know R is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we know R is not at position 3.

Similarly, we test H, U, B.

So let's go with ""SHRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 2? Then ""SHRUB"" or ""SHRUG"" would test R at position 3? But we are not testing position 2? Actually, in ""SHRUB"", R is at position 3, so we are not testing position 2.

We need to test position 2? We can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 2? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SCRUB"" has R at 2.

So let's choose ""SCRUB"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

So the third guess is ""SCRUB"".

But let me double-check: 
- S at 1: we know S is at 1, so it will be ✓.
- R at 2: we are testing if R is at 2.
- C at 3: new letter.
- U at 4: new vowel? We know A,I,E are absent, so U is okay.
- B at 5: new letter.

So we'll get feedback on all these.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what if the word has R at position 5? Then ""SCRUB"" would have R at 2? That might be wrong. But we are testing R at 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SUNNY"" has R at 5? But it has U and N? And N is common.

But ""SUNNY"" has U and N? And avoids forbidden letters? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5). But we have two N's? That might be confusing? But the feedback will mark each letter separately.

But we are testing: U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. Also, we are testing if N is in the word and if U is in the word.

But we don't know if the word has U or N.

But we can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two S's? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that S is present but wrong position? But we already know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, and if the word has only one S, then we'll get a '-' for S at 5? But if the word has two S's, then we might get a check for S at 5? But we don't know.

But to avoid complexity, let's stick with ""SCRUB"".

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SCRUB"" has S, R, C, U, B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. Good.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

So <guess>SCRUB</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S is correct at position 1).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- The letters A, I, E, P, O, T are absent.

For the third guess, I need to test the position of R and also test new common letters. I chose ""SCRUB"" because:
- It starts with S (which we know is correct).
- It places R at position 2 (a position we haven't tested for R) to check if R is there.
- It uses new letters (C, U, B) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, I, E, P, O, T).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- S at position 1: should be ✓ (correct).
- R at position 2: if correct, we get a check; if not, we know R is not at position 2.
- C at position 3: if present and correct, we get a check; if present but wrong position, we get '-'; if absent, we get 'x'.
- U at position 4: same.
- B at position 5: same.

This will give us information about the positions of R and the presence of C, U, B.",Guess 4: SCRUB -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(-) B(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I'll get feedback on these frequent letters.

""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it's acceptable in Wordle.

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.

So, step-by-step thoughts:
- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.

Then, output the guess in the format:

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    - R was in position 1, but it's not in position 1 in the secret word.
    - S was in position 4, but it's not in position 4 in the secret word.
- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).
- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Since R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.

Possible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.

Let's think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Common letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).

We also want to test new positions for R and S.

For example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.

So in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).

Let's try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Also, we want to cover more common letters. Let's try to include T, N, O, L, etc.

One common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let's check:
- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.

So ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" - but that's not common. Let's think of common words.

How about ""SPORT""? 
- S at position 1: that's a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That's allowed.
- P, O, T are new letters.

But note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let's see:
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 5: T

Yes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).

But we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.

Also, we avoid A,I,E.

So ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.
- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.
- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.

We can also consider other words.

Another common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).
- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let's see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). 
But wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it's wrong and we'll get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.

Therefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) 
- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.

Also, we can test T, U, N.

But is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.

But let me check if there are other options.

We know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.

We can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.

Let me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Possible words:
- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.
- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.
- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.
- CURRY: but has double R? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R's and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R's? But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

But note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R's, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R's, we might get both marked appropriately.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates to get clearer information.

So let's go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship's hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.

""SPORT"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We also test P, O, T.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

For example, we haven't tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.

We can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.

Let me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.

How about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don't know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don't know.

But let's stick to words without duplicates for now.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

A more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, K.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it's common and uses P, O, T which are common.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven't tested and that are more likely? But we don't have much information.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.

Let me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5
For S: 1,2,3,5

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.

For example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.

Similarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.

So we must avoid A,I,E.

Let me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? 
For example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.

How about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).
- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).
- We avoid A,I,E.

Also, we test C, U, B.

But note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.

So ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at 3 (ok).
- S is at 5 (ok).

We test C, U, B.

But we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.

How about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.

""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test P, O, T.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? 
For R: we know it's not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so it's ok.
For S: we know it's not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that's a new position, so ok.

So I'll go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.

Another word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.

""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, U, N.

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

But let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.

So I'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.

Also, we test P, O, T.

So let's go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. So we are testing O.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.

Word: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, N.

But ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.

But I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

I'll choose ""SPORT"".

So the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Excludes A, I, E.
- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.

I considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.

<guess>SPORT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
Model answer is not in the correct format<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: absent

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)
- P: absent
- O: absent
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 4)
- T: absent

So, from all this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters R and S (and we know they are not at the positions we guessed).
2. The secret word does not have A, I, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the positions:
- S is fixed at position 1 (because in SPORT, S is at position 1 and it's correct).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we know it's not at position 1 from the first guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _

We know:
- Position 1: must be S (because S is correct at position 1 in the second guess).

So the word starts with S.

- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 5 is available for R? Yes, because we haven't tested R at position 5 yet.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we know S and R are in the word, but we don't know the other two).

We must avoid the letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We can use other common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R (at position 2,3, or 5) and the other R? (we don't know if there are duplicates, but we'll avoid for now).
- Does not contain A,I,E,P,O,T.

Also, we should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- Position 2: then the word is S R _ _ _
- Position 3: then word is S _ R _ _
- Position 5: then word is S _ _ _ R

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these possibilities and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that start with S and have R in one of the positions 2,3,5, but avoiding the forbidden letters.

Common letters to test: L, N, U, D, C, etc.

We also note that the word must have two more letters (since we have S and R, and three more letters total? Actually, we know the word has R and S, and two more letters that are not A,I,E,P,O,T).

But we don't know the other letters. We should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent: A,I,E,P,O,T.

So let's try to form a word that starts with S, has R in position 2,3, or 5, and uses new letters.

Option 1: put R at position 2. Then the word is S R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicates, but in the example, there were no duplicates. However, we should avoid using R and S again in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for S.

But to maximize information, we should try new letters. So for the third and fourth positions, we can use new letters, and for the fifth, we can use R? But we don't know if R is at position 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid R and S in the positions we are testing? But we need to use them elsewhere.

But note: we have only two known letters: S and R. So we should include both? Actually, we can use one of them only if we have to, but we want to test new letters.

But we must include R and S because we know they are in the word? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without R or S? But we know they are in the word, so if we don't include them, we might not get information about their positions. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

We can use a word that includes R and S in positions we haven't ruled out, and then test new letters in the other positions.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, with R at position 2: S R _ _ _
We need to fill with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). Also, the letters must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S(1), R(2), C(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. But we have to check if it's valid. Yes, ""scrub"" is a word.
- ""SERUM"": S(1), R(2), E(3) -> but E is forbidden! We know E is absent. So avoid.
- ""SERUM"" has E -> invalid.
- ""SHRUB"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, B are new. Valid word.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.
- ""SKRIM"": S(1), R(2), K(3), I(4) -> but I is forbidden! We know I is absent. So avoid.
- ""SLURP"": S(1), R(2), L(3), U(4), P(5) -> P is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SWIRL"": S(1), R(2), W(3), I(4) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.

So without I and P, we have:
- ""SCRUB"": S, R, C, U, B -> all new letters? C, U, B are new. And no forbidden letters.
- ""SHRUB"": S, R, H, U, B -> H, U, B new.
- ""SHRUG"": S, R, H, U, G -> H, U, G new.
- ""SKRIM"": invalid because of I.
- ""SLURP"": invalid because of P and I.
- ""SWIRL"": invalid because of I.

Also, with R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need to fill the first two and last positions? Actually, positions 1 and 2 are fixed as S and then a letter, then R at 3.

Possible words:
- ""SNORT"": S(1), N(2), O(3) -> O is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""STERN"": S(1), T(2) -> T is forbidden? T is absent, so we cannot use T. And E is also forbidden. So avoid.
- ""SHIRT"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SCARF"": S(1), C(2), A(3) -> A and I are forbidden? A and I are absent, so avoid.
- ""SCUR"": only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Actually, ""SCUR"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""SHARD"": S(1), H(2), A(3) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHIRE"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
Possible words:
- ""SANDY"": S(1), A(2) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have S at 1 and then U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. But we know S is at 1, so that's fixed. Then R at 5 is a new position. But we have to avoid A,I,E,P,O,T. So ""SUNNY"" is S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have two N's? That's acceptable? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are testing U and N.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we can try without duplicates.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We need to place them in positions that are not ruled out and test new letters.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and then test common consonants and vowels (but vowels are limited: we know A,I,E are absent, so only O,U (and Y) are left? And sometimes W, etc.).

But we have U and O? We know O is absent, so we cannot use O. So we are left with U and Y (as vowel).

So for the word with R at position 2: S R U _ _ ? But we need a 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S R U C B -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S R U H B -> H, B new. Valid.
- ""SHRUG"": S R U H G -> H, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"" and ""SHRUG"" are similar.

With R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need a vowel? We have U? But we can try.

Possible words:
- ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> H, U, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S H R U B -> H, U, B new. Valid.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
We need a vowel? U is available.

Possible words:
- ""SUNNY"": S U N N Y -> U, N, Y new. But note: we have two N's? And we don't know if N is in the word. Also, Y is a vowel? But we can try. But we have U and N.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests C, U, B.

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? That might be less common.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We can try to put R at position 2 and then test common letters.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

But let me check: the secret word has S at position 1 and R somewhere else. In ""SCRUB"", we put R at position 2 and U at 4, B at 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for R. So maybe we should test R at position 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SHRUG"" has R at position 3? Let me see: S H R U G -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:U, 5:G. So R is at position 3.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" has R at position 3.

So both are valid.

But ""SHRUG"" tests H, U, G.

We can also consider ""SHRUB"" for the same.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are safe.

I think ""SHRUB"" is a good choice because it tests H, U, B.

But let's see: we have S at 1, then H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We know R is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we know R is not at position 3.

Similarly, we test H, U, B.

So let's go with ""SHRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 2? Then ""SHRUB"" or ""SHRUG"" would test R at position 3? But we are not testing position 2? Actually, in ""SHRUB"", R is at position 3, so we are not testing position 2.

We need to test position 2? We can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 2? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SCRUB"" has R at 2.

So let's choose ""SCRUB"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

So the third guess is ""SCRUB"".

But let me double-check: 
- S at 1: we know S is at 1, so it will be ✓.
- R at 2: we are testing if R is at 2.
- C at 3: new letter.
- U at 4: new vowel? We know A,I,E are absent, so U is okay.
- B at 5: new letter.

So we'll get feedback on all these.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what if the word has R at position 5? Then ""SCRUB"" would have R at 2? That might be wrong. But we are testing R at 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SUNNY"" has R at 5? But it has U and N? And N is common.

But ""SUNNY"" has U and N? And avoids forbidden letters? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5). But we have two N's? That might be confusing? But the feedback will mark each letter separately.

But we are testing: U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. Also, we are testing if N is in the word and if U is in the word.

But we don't know if the word has U or N.

But we can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two S's? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that S is present but wrong position? But we already know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, and if the word has only one S, then we'll get a '-' for S at 5? But if the word has two S's, then we might get a check for S at 5? But we don't know.

But to avoid complexity, let's stick with ""SCRUB"".

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SCRUB"" has S, R, C, U, B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. Good.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

So <guess>SCRUB</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S is correct at position 1).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- The letters A, I, E, P, O, T are absent.

For the third guess, I need to test the position of R and also test new common letters. I chose ""SCRUB"" because:
- It starts with S (which we know is correct).
- It places R at position 2 (a position we haven't tested for R) to check if R is there.
- It uses new letters (C, U, B) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, I, E, P, O, T).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- S at position 1: should be ✓ (correct).
- R at position 2: if correct, we get a check; if not, we know R is not at position 2.
- C at position 3: if present and correct, we get a check; if present but wrong position, we get '-'; if absent, we get 'x'.
- U at position 4: same.
- B at position 5: same.

This will give us information about the positions of R and the presence of C, U, B.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.\n\nIn Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.\n\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.\n\nA popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.\n\nI need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I\'ll get feedback on these frequent letters.\n\n""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it\'s acceptable in Wordle.\n\nNow, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.\n\nSo, step-by-step thoughts:\n- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.\n- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.\n\nThen, output the guess in the format:\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.\n- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.\n- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:\n    - R was in position 1, but it\'s not in position 1 in the secret word.\n    - S was in position 4, but it\'s not in position 4 in the secret word.\n- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters long.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).\n- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).\n- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.\n\nSince R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.\n\nCommon letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).\n\nWe also want to test new positions for R and S.\n\nFor example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nAlso, we want to cover more common letters. Let\'s try to include T, N, O, L, etc.\n\nOne common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let\'s check:\n- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.\n\nSo ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" - but that\'s not common. Let\'s think of common words.\n\nHow about ""SPORT""? \n- S at position 1: that\'s a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That\'s allowed.\n- P, O, T are new letters.\n\nBut note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let\'s see:\nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: P\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: T\n\nYes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).\n\nBut we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.\n\nAlso, we avoid A,I,E.\n\nSo ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if it meets the criteria:\n- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.\n- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.\n- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).\n- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let\'s see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). \nBut wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it\'s in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it\'s wrong and we\'ll get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) \n- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.\n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we can test T, U, N.\n\nBut is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me check if there are other options.\n\nWe know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.\n- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.\n- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.\n- CURRY: but has double R? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R\'s and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don\'t know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R\'s, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R\'s, we might get both marked appropriately.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to get clearer information.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship\'s hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.\n\n""SPORT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe also test P, O, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and also includes other common letters.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.\n\nWe can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.\n\nLet me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nHow about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don\'t know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nA more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, K.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it\'s common and uses P, O, T which are common.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and that are more likely? But we don\'t have much information.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.\n\nLet me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5\nFor S: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.\n\nFor example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.\n\nSo we must avoid A,I,E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? \nFor example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.\n\nHow about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).\n- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).\n- We avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we test C, U, B.\n\nBut note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.\n\nSo ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at 3 (ok).\n- S is at 5 (ok).\n\nWe test C, U, B.\n\nBut we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence for that.\n\nI think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.\n\nHow about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.\n\n""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test P, O, T.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? \nFor R: we know it\'s not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so it\'s ok.\nFor S: we know it\'s not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that\'s a new position, so ok.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. But we are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.\n\n""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, U, N.\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""SPORT"".\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.\n\nAlso, we test P, O, T.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. So we are testing O.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.\n\nWord: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, N.\n\nBut ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.\n\nBut I think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SPORT"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the word but not at position 1.\n- S is in the word but not at position 4.\n- A, I, E are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.\n- Excludes A, I, E.\n- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.\n\nI considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)\n- A: absent\n- I: absent\n- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 4)\n- E: absent\n\nGuess 2: SPORT\n- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)\n- P: absent\n- O: absent\n- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 4)\n- T: absent\n\nSo, from all this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letters R and S (and we know they are not at the positions we guessed).\n2. The secret word does not have A, I, E, P, O, T.\n\nAlso, from the positions:\n- S is fixed at position 1 (because in SPORT, S is at position 1 and it\'s correct).\n- R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we know it\'s not at position 1 from the first guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T.\n\nWe have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: must be S (because S is correct at position 1 in the second guess).\n\nSo the word starts with S.\n\n- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: position 5 is available for R? Yes, because we haven\'t tested R at position 5 yet.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we know S and R are in the word, but we don\'t know the other two).\n\nWe must avoid the letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.\n\nWe can use other common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n- Starts with S.\n- Contains R (at position 2,3, or 5) and the other R? (we don\'t know if there are duplicates, but we\'ll avoid for now).\n- Does not contain A,I,E,P,O,T.\n\nAlso, we should try to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for R:\n- Position 2: then the word is S R _ _ _\n- Position 3: then word is S _ R _ _\n- Position 5: then word is S _ _ _ R\n\nWe need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these possibilities and also test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with S and have R in one of the positions 2,3,5, but avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\nCommon letters to test: L, N, U, D, C, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must have two more letters (since we have S and R, and three more letters total? Actually, we know the word has R and S, and two more letters that are not A,I,E,P,O,T).\n\nBut we don\'t know the other letters. We should try to include letters that are common and that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should avoid using letters we know are absent: A,I,E,P,O,T.\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word that starts with S, has R in position 2,3, or 5, and uses new letters.\n\nOption 1: put R at position 2. Then the word is S R _ _ _\nWe need to fill the last three positions with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence). But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t forbid duplicates, but in the example, there were no duplicates. However, we should avoid using R and S again in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. Similarly for S.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should try new letters. So for the third and fourth positions, we can use new letters, and for the fifth, we can use R? But we don\'t know if R is at position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid R and S in the positions we are testing? But we need to use them elsewhere.\n\nBut note: we have only two known letters: S and R. So we should include both? Actually, we can use one of them only if we have to, but we want to test new letters.\n\nBut we must include R and S because we know they are in the word? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without R or S? But we know they are in the word, so if we don\'t include them, we might not get information about their positions. However, the rules don\'t require that we use known letters, but it\'s efficient to do so.\n\nWe can use a word that includes R and S in positions we haven\'t ruled out, and then test new letters in the other positions.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words.\n\nFirst, with R at position 2: S R _ _ _\nWe need to fill with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence). Also, the letters must be in the word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SCRUB"": S(1), R(2), C(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. But we have to check if it\'s valid. Yes, ""scrub"" is a word.\n- ""SERUM"": S(1), R(2), E(3) -> but E is forbidden! We know E is absent. So avoid.\n- ""SERUM"" has E -> invalid.\n- ""SHRUB"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, B are new. Valid word.\n- ""SHRUG"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.\n- ""SKRIM"": S(1), R(2), K(3), I(4) -> but I is forbidden! We know I is absent. So avoid.\n- ""SLURP"": S(1), R(2), L(3), U(4), P(5) -> P is forbidden! Avoid.\n- ""SWIRL"": S(1), R(2), W(3), I(4) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.\n\nSo without I and P, we have:\n- ""SCRUB"": S, R, C, U, B -> all new letters? C, U, B are new. And no forbidden letters.\n- ""SHRUB"": S, R, H, U, B -> H, U, B new.\n- ""SHRUG"": S, R, H, U, G -> H, U, G new.\n- ""SKRIM"": invalid because of I.\n- ""SLURP"": invalid because of P and I.\n- ""SWIRL"": invalid because of I.\n\nAlso, with R at position 3: S _ R _ _\nWe need to fill the first two and last positions? Actually, positions 1 and 2 are fixed as S and then a letter, then R at 3.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SNORT"": S(1), N(2), O(3) -> O is forbidden! Avoid.\n- ""STERN"": S(1), T(2) -> T is forbidden? T is absent, so we cannot use T. And E is also forbidden. So avoid.\n- ""SHIRT"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.\n- ""SCARF"": S(1), C(2), A(3) -> A and I are forbidden?

U, N are new. But note: we have S at 1 and then U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. But we know S is at 1, so that\'s fixed. Then R at 5 is a new position. But we have to avoid A,I,E,P,O,T. So ""SUNNY"" is S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have two N\'s? That\'s acceptable? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are testing U and N.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we can try without duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two known letters: S and R. We need to place them in positions that are not ruled out and test new letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 and then test common consonants and vowels (but vowels are limited: we know A,I,E are absent, so only O,U (and Y) are left? And sometimes W, etc.).\n\nBut we have U and O? We know O is absent, so we cannot use O. So we are left with U and Y (as vowel).\n\nSo for the word with R at position 2: S R U _ _ ? But we need a 5-letter word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SCRUB"": S R U C B -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUB"": S R U H B -> H, B new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUG"": S R U H G -> H, G new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUB"" and ""SHRUG"" are similar.\n\nWith R at position 3: S _ R _ _\nWe need a vowel? We have U? But we can try.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> H, U, G new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUB"": S H R U B -> H, U, B new. Valid.\n\nWith R at position 5: S _ _ _ R\nWe need a vowel? U is available.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SUNNY"": S U N N Y -> U, N, Y new. But note: we have two N\'s? And we don\'t know if N is in the word. Also, Y is a vowel? But we can try. But we have U and N.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters.\n\nI think ""SCRUB"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests C, U, B.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? That might be less common.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two known letters: S and R. We can try to put R at position 2 and then test common letters.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid.\n\nI think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: the secret word has S at position 1 and R somewhere else. In ""SCRUB"", we put R at position 2 and U at 4, B at 5.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3 for R. So maybe we should test R at position 3? But we can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 3? But we don\'t have a good candidate without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example, ""SHRUG"" has R at position 3? Let me see: S H R U G -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:U, 5:G. So R is at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHRUB"" has R at position 3.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut ""SHRUG"" tests H, U, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHRUB"" for the same.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are safe.\n\nI think ""SHRUB"" is a good choice because it tests H, U, B.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have S at 1, then H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.\n\nWe know R is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3. If it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we know R is not at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we test H, U, B.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SHRUB"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 2? Then ""SHRUB"" or ""SHRUG"" would test R at position 3? But we are not testing position 2? Actually, in ""SHRUB"", R is at position 3, so we are not testing position 2.\n\nWe need to test position 2? We can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 2? But we don\'t have a good candidate without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example, ""SCRUB"" has R at 2.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid.\n\nI think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.\n\nSo the third guess is ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- S at 1: we know S is at 1, so it will be ✓.\n- R at 2: we are testing if R is at 2.\n- C at 3: new letter.\n- U at 4: new vowel? We know A,I,E are absent, so U is okay.\n- B at 5: new letter.\n\nSo we\'ll get feedback on all these.\n\nSo the guess is ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word has R at position 5? Then ""SCRUB"" would have R at 2? That might be wrong. But we are testing R at 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5? But we don\'t have a good candidate without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example, ""SUNNY"" has R at 5? But it has U and N? And N is common.\n\nBut ""SUNNY"" has U and N? And avoids forbidden letters? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5). But we have two N\'s? That might be confusing? But the feedback will mark each letter separately.\n\nBut we are testing: U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. Also, we are testing if N is in the word and if U is in the word.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has U or N.\n\nBut we can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two S\'s? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that S is present but wrong position? But we already know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, and if the word has only one S, then we\'ll get a \'-\' for S at 5? But if the word has two S\'s, then we might get a check for S at 5? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, let\'s stick with ""SCRUB"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SCRUB"" has S, R, C, U, B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. Good.\n\nSo the guess is ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.\n\nSo <guess>SCRUB</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S is correct at position 1).\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n- The letters A, I, E, P, O, T are absent.\n\nFor the third guess, I need to test the position of R and also test new common letters. I chose ""SCRUB"" because:\n- It starts with S (which we know is correct).\n- It places R at position 2 (a position we haven\'t tested for R) to check if R is there.\n- It uses new letters (C, U, B) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, I, E, P, O, T).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on:\n- S at position 1: should be ✓ (correct).\n- R at position 2: if correct, we get a check; if not, we know R is not at position 2.\n- C at position 3: if present and correct, we get a check; if present but wrong position, we get \'-\'; if absent, we get \'x\'.\n- U at position 4: same.\n- B at position 5: same.\n\nThis will give us information about the positions of R and the presence of C, U, B.\n\n<guess>SCRUB</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 4: SCRUB -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(-) B(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, not at position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, not at position 4)
- E: absent

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: correct position (so S is at position 1)
- P: absent
- O: absent
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, not at position 4)
- T: absent

Guess 3: SCRUB
- S: correct position (as expected)
- C: absent
- R: correct position (so R is at position 3)
- U: present but wrong position (so U is in the word, not at position 4)
- B: absent

So, from all feedback:

- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- U is in the word but not at position 4 (and not at position 1 or 3 because those are fixed to S and R). So U must be at position 2 or 5.
- Letters absent: A, I, E, P, O, T, C, B.

We know the word is S _ R _ _

And U is in the word, but not at position 4. So U must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to find the remaining two letters.

The word has 5 letters: positions 2, 4, and 5 are unknown (but position 4 cannot be U, and we know U is at 2 or 5).

We have eliminated: A, I, E, P, O, T, C, B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S and U are already in the word, and we know their positions are not 1 and 4 respectively? Actually, S is at 1 and fixed, U is at 4 but we know it's not at 4 in the secret word? Wait, no: in the feedback for SCRUB, U was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position. So U is in the word but not at position 4. But position 4 is the fourth letter, so U must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, we have R at position 3, so the word is S _ R _ _.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: S _ R _ _ with U in either position 2 or 5, and the other two letters from the available set.

But note: we don't know if U is at position 2 or 5. So we can try to test both possibilities? Or we can test one.

We can try a word that has U at position 2 and then test common letters for the other positions.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

We need to choose a word that starts with S, has R at position 3, and includes U in either position 2 or 5.

But we don't know which position U is in, so we can try to put U at position 2 and see.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me list possible words:

- If U is at position 2: S U R _ _
  - Then the last two positions must be filled with letters not in the forbidden set and not R, S, U (unless duplicate, but we don't know).

  Possible words:
  - ""SURLY"" -> S U R L Y -> L and Y are new. But Y is less common.
  - ""SURLY"" is valid? Yes, meaning talkative or garrulous.

  But we don't know if L or Y are in the word.

- If U is at position 5: S _ R _ U
  - Then the word ends with U.

  Possible words:
  - ""STERN"" -> but T is absent, so invalid.
  - ""SCORN"" -> C absent, invalid.
  - ""SHURN"" -> not a word.
  - ""SNORT"" -> T absent, invalid.
  - ""SHRUB"" -> S H R U B -> but we have U at position 4? But in this case, U is at position 5? Wait, no: in S _ R _ U, U is at position 5.

  Actually, for S _ R _ U, the positions are:
    1: S
    2: ? 
    3: R
    4: ?
    5: U

  So the word is S, ?, R, ?, U.

  Examples:
  - ""SUGAR"" -> but A is absent? A is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""SUGAR"" has A -> invalid.
  - ""SUGAR"" is invalid because of A.

  ""SUGAR"" has A -> invalid.

  ""SHIRU"" -> not a common word? And U is at position 5? But ""SHIRU"" is not standard.

  ""SHIRU"" might not be accepted. Let's think of common words.

  ""SHRUB"" is S H R U B -> but U is at position 4? In S _ R _ U, U is at position 5? I think I confused.

  Actually, for S _ R _ U, the positions are:
    1: S
    2: ?
    3: R
    4: ?
    5: U

  So the word is S, X, R, Y, U, where X and Y are letters.

  Examples:
  - ""SIRUP"" -> but I is absent -> invalid.
  - ""SHIRU"" -> not common, and U is at position 5? Actually, ""SHIRU"" is S H I R U -> but I is absent -> invalid.

  It's hard to find common words ending with U. Let me think.

  ""STERN"" is S T E R N -> but T and E are absent -> invalid.

  ""SCORN"" is S C O R N -> C and O absent -> invalid.

  ""SHURN"" not a word.

  ""SNOUT"" -> S N O U T -> O and T absent -> invalid.

  ""SHRUB"" is S H R U B -> but U is at position 4? In ""SHRUB"", the positions are:
    1: S
    2: H
    3: R
    4: U
    5: B

  But we know U is not at position 4? From the feedback of SCRUB, U was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position. So U cannot be at position 4. Therefore, ""SHRUB"" would have U at position 4, which is invalid.

  So we need a word where U is at position 2 or 5, and not at position 4.

  For position 2: S U R _ _
  - Examples: ""SURLY"", ""SURLY"" is valid.

  For position 5: S _ R _ U
  - Examples: ""SUGAR"" invalid (A), ""SHIRU"" invalid (I), ""SHARU"" not common, ""SHORU"" not common.

  Another word: ""SHORU"" is not common.

  ""SHRUB"" has U at position 4, which is invalid.

  So the only common word I can think of with U at position 2 is ""SURLY"".

  But let's check: ""SURLY"" is S U R L Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y.

  This avoids forbidden letters? U is at position 2, which is allowed. And L and Y are new.

  But we also have the possibility that U is at position 5.

  Another word for U at position 5: ""SABRU"" -> but A is absent -> invalid.

  ""SABRU"" has A -> invalid.

  ""SABURU"" -> not common.

  ""SUGAR"" has A -> invalid.

  ""SHIRU"" has I -> invalid.

  ""SHORU"" not common.

  So perhaps U at position 2 is more likely? But we don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has U at position 5 and tests other common letters.

  For example, we can try ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> but U is at position 4? In ""SHRUG"", the positions are:
    1: S
    2: H
    3: R
    4: U
    5: G

  But we know U is not at position 4? So if we guess ""SHRUG"", we will get U at position 4 marked as wrong position? But we already know U is not at position 4, so it would be a waste? But we can use it to test H and G.

  However, we are trying to find the word, so we should try to get as much information as possible.

  But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

  We know the word has S at 1, R at 3, and U somewhere (at 2 or 5). And two more letters.

  We can try a word that has U at position 2 and then tests common letters for the other positions.

  But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

  Let me think of words that start with S, have R at position 3, and include U at position 2.

  ""SURLY"" is one.

  Another: ""SURLY"" is valid.

  ""SURLY"" uses L and Y.

  But we don't know if L or Y are in the word.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has U at position 5 and tests common letters for the other positions.

  For example, ""SUGAR"" is invalid because of A.

  ""SHRUB"" has U at position 4, which is invalid.

  ""SHRUG"" has U at position 4? S H R U G -> U at 4 -> invalid.

  ""SHRUB"" is S H R U B -> U at 4 -> invalid.

  ""SHRUG"" is S H R U G -> U at 4 -> invalid.

  ""SHRUB"" is S H R U B -> U at 4 -> invalid.

  ""SHRUG"" is S H R U G -> U at 4 -> invalid.

  ""SHRUB"" is S H R U B -> U at 4 -> invalid.

  ""SHRUB"" is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

In Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I'll get feedback on these frequent letters.

""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it's acceptable in Wordle.

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.

So, step-by-step thoughts:
- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.

Then, output the guess in the format:

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    - R was in position 1, but it's not in position 1 in the secret word.
    - S was in position 4, but it's not in position 4 in the secret word.
- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).
- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Since R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.

Possible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.

Let's think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Common letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).

We also want to test new positions for R and S.

For example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.

So in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).

Let's try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Also, we want to cover more common letters. Let's try to include T, N, O, L, etc.

One common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let's check:
- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.

So ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" - but that's not common. Let's think of common words.

How about ""SPORT""? 
- S at position 1: that's a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That's allowed.
- P, O, T are new letters.

But note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let's see:
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 5: T

Yes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).

But we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.

Also, we avoid A,I,E.

So ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.
- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.
- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.

We can also consider other words.

Another common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).
- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let's see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). 
But wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it's wrong and we'll get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.

Therefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) 
- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.

Also, we can test T, U, N.

But is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.

But let me check if there are other options.

We know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.

We can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.

Let me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.

Possible words:
- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.
- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.
- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.
- CURRY: but has double R? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R's and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R's? But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

But note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R's, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R's, we might get both marked appropriately.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates to get clearer information.

So let's go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship's hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.

""SPORT"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We also test P, O, T.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

For example, we haven't tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.

We can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.

Let me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.

How about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don't know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don't know.

But let's stick to words without duplicates for now.

Another word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R is at position 4 (ok).
- S is at position 1 (ok).

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

A more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, K.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it's common and uses P, O, T which are common.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven't tested and that are more likely? But we don't have much information.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.

Let me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5
For S: 1,2,3,5

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.

For example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.

Similarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.

So we must avoid A,I,E.

Let me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? 
For example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.

How about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).
- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).
- We avoid A,I,E.

Also, we test C, U, B.

But note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.

So ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). 
- R is at 3 (ok).
- S is at 5 (ok).

We test C, U, B.

But we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.

We might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that.

I think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.

How about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.

""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test P, O, T.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? 
For R: we know it's not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so it's ok.
For S: we know it's not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that's a new position, so ok.

So I'll go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.

Another word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.

""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, U, N.

But ""STURN"" might be less common.

I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

But let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.

So I'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.

We might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.

Also, we test P, O, T.

So let's go with ""SPORT"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don't know. So we are testing O.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.

Word: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
- R at 4 (ok).
- S at 1 (ok).

We test T, O, N.

But ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.

But I think ""SPORT"" is fine.

I'll choose ""SPORT"".

So the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- S is in the word but not at position 4.
- A, I, E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Excludes A, I, E.
- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.

I considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
Model answer is not in the correct format<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: absent

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)
- P: absent
- O: absent
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 4)
- T: absent

So, from all this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters R and S (and we know they are not at the positions we guessed).
2. The secret word does not have A, I, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the positions:
- S is fixed at position 1 (because in SPORT, S is at position 1 and it's correct).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we know it's not at position 1 from the first guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _

We know:
- Position 1: must be S (because S is correct at position 1 in the second guess).

So the word starts with S.

- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 5 is available for R? Yes, because we haven't tested R at position 5 yet.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we know S and R are in the word, but we don't know the other two).

We must avoid the letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.

We can use other common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R (at position 2,3, or 5) and the other R? (we don't know if there are duplicates, but we'll avoid for now).
- Does not contain A,I,E,P,O,T.

Also, we should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- Position 2: then the word is S R _ _ _
- Position 3: then word is S _ R _ _
- Position 5: then word is S _ _ _ R

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these possibilities and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that start with S and have R in one of the positions 2,3,5, but avoiding the forbidden letters.

Common letters to test: L, N, U, D, C, etc.

We also note that the word must have two more letters (since we have S and R, and three more letters total? Actually, we know the word has R and S, and two more letters that are not A,I,E,P,O,T).

But we don't know the other letters. We should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent: A,I,E,P,O,T.

So let's try to form a word that starts with S, has R in position 2,3, or 5, and uses new letters.

Option 1: put R at position 2. Then the word is S R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicates, but in the example, there were no duplicates. However, we should avoid using R and S again in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for S.

But to maximize information, we should try new letters. So for the third and fourth positions, we can use new letters, and for the fifth, we can use R? But we don't know if R is at position 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid R and S in the positions we are testing? But we need to use them elsewhere.

But note: we have only two known letters: S and R. So we should include both? Actually, we can use one of them only if we have to, but we want to test new letters.

But we must include R and S because we know they are in the word? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without R or S? But we know they are in the word, so if we don't include them, we might not get information about their positions. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

We can use a word that includes R and S in positions we haven't ruled out, and then test new letters in the other positions.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, with R at position 2: S R _ _ _
We need to fill with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence). Also, the letters must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S(1), R(2), C(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. But we have to check if it's valid. Yes, ""scrub"" is a word.
- ""SERUM"": S(1), R(2), E(3) -> but E is forbidden! We know E is absent. So avoid.
- ""SERUM"" has E -> invalid.
- ""SHRUB"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, B are new. Valid word.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.
- ""SKRIM"": S(1), R(2), K(3), I(4) -> but I is forbidden! We know I is absent. So avoid.
- ""SLURP"": S(1), R(2), L(3), U(4), P(5) -> P is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SWIRL"": S(1), R(2), W(3), I(4) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.

So without I and P, we have:
- ""SCRUB"": S, R, C, U, B -> all new letters? C, U, B are new. And no forbidden letters.
- ""SHRUB"": S, R, H, U, B -> H, U, B new.
- ""SHRUG"": S, R, H, U, G -> H, U, G new.
- ""SKRIM"": invalid because of I.
- ""SLURP"": invalid because of P and I.
- ""SWIRL"": invalid because of I.

Also, with R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need to fill the first two and last positions? Actually, positions 1 and 2 are fixed as S and then a letter, then R at 3.

Possible words:
- ""SNORT"": S(1), N(2), O(3) -> O is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""STERN"": S(1), T(2) -> T is forbidden? T is absent, so we cannot use T. And E is also forbidden. So avoid.
- ""SHIRT"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.
- ""SCARF"": S(1), C(2), A(3) -> A and I are forbidden? A and I are absent, so avoid.
- ""SCUR"": only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Actually, ""SCUR"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""SHARD"": S(1), H(2), A(3) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHIRE"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SHRUG"": S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
Possible words:
- ""SANDY"": S(1), A(2) -> A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have S at 1 and then U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. But we know S is at 1, so that's fixed. Then R at 5 is a new position. But we have to avoid A,I,E,P,O,T. So ""SUNNY"" is S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have two N's? That's acceptable? But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are testing U and N.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we can try without duplicates.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We need to place them in positions that are not ruled out and test new letters.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 and then test common consonants and vowels (but vowels are limited: we know A,I,E are absent, so only O,U (and Y) are left? And sometimes W, etc.).

But we have U and O? We know O is absent, so we cannot use O. So we are left with U and Y (as vowel).

So for the word with R at position 2: S R U _ _ ? But we need a 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- ""SCRUB"": S R U C B -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S R U H B -> H, B new. Valid.
- ""SHRUG"": S R U H G -> H, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"" and ""SHRUG"" are similar.

With R at position 3: S _ R _ _
We need a vowel? We have U? But we can try.

Possible words:
- ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> H, U, G new. Valid.
- ""SHRUB"": S H R U B -> H, U, B new. Valid.

With R at position 5: S _ _ _ R
We need a vowel? U is available.

Possible words:
- ""SUNNY"": S U N N Y -> U, N, Y new. But note: we have two N's? And we don't know if N is in the word. Also, Y is a vowel? But we can try. But we have U and N.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests C, U, B.

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? That might be less common.

But let's see: we have two known letters: S and R. We can try to put R at position 2 and then test common letters.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

But let me check: the secret word has S at position 1 and R somewhere else. In ""SCRUB"", we put R at position 2 and U at 4, B at 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for R. So maybe we should test R at position 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SHRUG"" has R at position 3? Let me see: S H R U G -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:U, 5:G. So R is at position 3.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" has R at position 3.

So both are valid.

But ""SHRUG"" tests H, U, G.

We can also consider ""SHRUB"" for the same.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are safe.

I think ""SHRUB"" is a good choice because it tests H, U, B.

But let's see: we have S at 1, then H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We know R is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we know R is not at position 3.

Similarly, we test H, U, B.

So let's go with ""SHRUB"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 2? Then ""SHRUB"" or ""SHRUG"" would test R at position 3? But we are not testing position 2? Actually, in ""SHRUB"", R is at position 3, so we are not testing position 2.

We need to test position 2? We can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 2? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SCRUB"" has R at 2.

So let's choose ""SCRUB"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid.

I think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.

So the third guess is ""SCRUB"".

But let me double-check: 
- S at 1: we know S is at 1, so it will be ✓.
- R at 2: we are testing if R is at 2.
- C at 3: new letter.
- U at 4: new vowel? We know A,I,E are absent, so U is okay.
- B at 5: new letter.

So we'll get feedback on all these.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But wait: what if the word has R at position 5? Then ""SCRUB"" would have R at 2? That might be wrong. But we are testing R at 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5? But we don't have a good candidate without forbidden letters.

For example, ""SUNNY"" has R at 5? But it has U and N? And N is common.

But ""SUNNY"" has U and N? And avoids forbidden letters? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5). But we have two N's? That might be confusing? But the feedback will mark each letter separately.

But we are testing: U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. Also, we are testing if N is in the word and if U is in the word.

But we don't know if the word has U or N.

But we can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two S's? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that S is present but wrong position? But we already know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, and if the word has only one S, then we'll get a '-' for S at 5? But if the word has two S's, then we might get a check for S at 5? But we don't know.

But to avoid complexity, let's stick with ""SCRUB"".

So I'll go with ""SCRUB"".

But let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SCRUB"" has S, R, C, U, B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. Good.

So the guess is ""SCRUB"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.

So <guess>SCRUB</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S is correct at position 1).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- The letters A, I, E, P, O, T are absent.

For the third guess, I need to test the position of R and also test new common letters. I chose ""SCRUB"" because:
- It starts with S (which we know is correct).
- It places R at position 2 (a position we haven't tested for R) to check if R is there.
- It uses new letters (C, U, B) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, I, E, P, O, T).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- S at position 1: should be ✓ (correct).
- R at position 2: if correct, we get a check; if not, we know R is not at position 2.
- C at position 3: if present and correct, we get a check; if present but wrong position, we get '-'; if absent, we get 'x'.
- U at position 4: same.
- B at position 5: same.

This will give us information about the positions of R and the presence of C, U, B.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.\n\nIn Wordle, a good starting word often uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels are important because most words have vowels, and some consonants can be frequent too. I should aim for a word with letters that appear often in English words.\n\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc.\n\nA popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include several common letters. But I can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"", which have high-frequency letters.\n\nI need to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me pick ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). That way, I\'ll get feedback on these frequent letters.\n\n""RAISE"" is a valid word. It means to lift up or increase something. Yes, it\'s acceptable in Wordle.\n\nNow, for the response format, I need to think step by step withintags, and then output the guess in the specified format.\n\nSo, step-by-step thoughts:\n- I have no prior information, so I choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information.\n- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters that can help identify vowels and common consonants in the secret word.\n\nThen, output the guess in the format:\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.\n- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.\n- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:\n    - R was in position 1, but it\'s not in position 1 in the secret word.\n    - S was in position 4, but it\'s not in position 4 in the secret word.\n- The letters A, I, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must include R and S, and exclude A, I, E.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters long.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).\n- Contains R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in RAISE, R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they cannot be at those positions in the secret word).\n- Also, we might want to include other common letters to test for their presence.\n\nSince R and S are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions. Also, we should avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it was not at position 1, it could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, S could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain A, I, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.\n\nCommon letters we might try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (that are not A, I, E).\n\nWe also want to test new positions for R and S.\n\nFor example, we know R is not at position 1. So if we put R at position 1 in our next guess, that would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we know S is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should try R in a different position (2,3,4,5) and S in a different position (1,2,3,5).\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nAlso, we want to cover more common letters. Let\'s try to include T, N, O, L, etc.\n\nOne common word that comes to mind is ""ROUST"", but let\'s check:\n- R is at position 1: but we know R is not at position 1 (from the first guess). So if we put R at position 1, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid position 1 for R.\n\nSo ""ROUST"" has R at 1 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" - but that\'s not common. Let\'s think of common words.\n\nHow about ""SPORT""? \n- S at position 1: that\'s a new position for S (previously it was at 4, now at 1). That\'s allowed.\n- P, O, T are new letters.\n\nBut note: we have R in the word, so we must include R. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4? Let\'s see:\nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: P\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: T\n\nYes, R is at position 4, which is allowed (since previously it was at 1 and now 4 is different).\n\nBut we also know that S is in the word and not at position 4, but in ""SPORT"" S is at position 1, which is okay.\n\nAlso, we avoid A,I,E.\n\nSo ""SPORT"" seems like a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if it meets the criteria:\n- Contains R and S (which we know are in the word) and three new letters: P, O, T.\n- R is at position 4 (not 1) -> good.\n- S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother common word: ""CURST"" (meaning to allow something to happen for a longer period).\n- C, U, R, S, T -> avoids A,I,E, and R is at 3? Let\'s see: C(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). \nBut wait: in the first guess, S was at position 4 and we were told it\'s in the word but not at 4. So if we put S at position 4 again, we know it\'s wrong and we\'ll get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t help. So we should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""CURST"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird, past tense of ""sturn"" meaning to turn or a verb meaning to disturb) \n- S at 1, T at 2, U at 3, R at 4, N at 5.\n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut note: we have R and S, and we avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we can test T, U, N.\n\nBut is ""STURN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me check if there are other options.\n\nWe know R is in the word and not at position 1. We can try R at position 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, S is not at position 4, so we can try S at position 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has R and S and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as T, N, O, L.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and S, and avoid A,I,E, and with R not at 1 and S not at 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- SPORT: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) -> R at 4, S at 1. Tests P, O, T.\n- STERN: S(1), T(2), E(3) -> but E is not allowed! We know E is absent. So avoid E.\n- STORK: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5) -> avoids A,I,E, and tests T, O, K.\n- CURRY: but has double R? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? Also, C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) -> duplicate R and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we know E is absent, but this word has R and S? Actually, CURRY has R and S? Let me check: C,U,R,R,Y -> has R and S? No, CURRY has one R and one S? Wait, CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y, so it has two R\'s and one S? Actually, CURRY has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback for RAISE had R and S, but we don\'t know if the word has more than one of a letter? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. For example, if the word has two R\'s, then if we guess a word with one R and the secret word has two, we might get one R marked as present but wrong position and the other as absent? Or if we guess a word with two R\'s, we might get both marked appropriately.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to get clearer information.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"" or ""STORK"" or ""PORTS"" (meaning: the lower part of a ship\'s hull) but ""PORTS"" is not very common.\n\n""SPORT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we have R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe also test P, O, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and also includes other common letters.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested position 2,3,5 for R and position 1,2,3,5 for S.\n\nWe can try a word that has S at position 2 and R at position 3? Or something.\n\nLet me try to think of a word with S at position 2 and R at position 3: e.g., ""CURST"" but has S at 4? No, CURST is C-U-R-S-T -> S is at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nHow about ""DURUM""? But D,U,R,U,M -> duplicate U and we don\'t know. Also, we avoid A,I,E, but D,U,R,U,M -> has U and M? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""STURN"" (a bird) -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R is at position 4 (ok).\n- S is at position 1 (ok).\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nA more common word: ""STORK"" (a person who works in a store) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, K.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it\'s common and uses P, O, T which are common.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know are in the word: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and S in positions that we haven\'t tested and that are more likely? But we don\'t have much information.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the first guess, R was at 1 and S at 4. Now we can try R at 2 and S at 3? Or R at 3 and S at 2? etc.\n\nLet me try to list positions for R: 2,3,4,5\nFor S: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 and S at position 3? Or R at position 3 and S at position 1? etc.\n\nFor example, ""STARS"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A is absent! We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, ""STIRS"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3) -> I is absent, so avoid I.\n\nSo we must avoid A,I,E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at position 2 and S at position 3? \nFor example, ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> but A is absent! So avoid A.\n\nHow about ""CURBS""? C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at position 3 (ok, because previously R was at 1 and now 3 is new).\n- S is at position 5 (ok, because previously S was at 4 and now 5 is new).\n- We avoid A,I,E.\n\nAlso, we test C, U, B.\n\nBut note: we have R at 3 and S at 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": R(1) -> avoid! Because we know R is not at position 1.\n\nSo ""CURBS"" is a candidate: C(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), S(5). \n- R is at 3 (ok).\n- S is at 5 (ok).\n\nWe test C, U, B.\n\nBut we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""CURBS"", R is at 3 and S at 5.\n\nWe might get feedback on whether R is at 3 and S at 5? Or if they are elsewhere.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence for that.\n\nI think ""CURBS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. T is a very common letter. So is N.\n\nHow about ""SPORT"" with T? Or ""STERN"" but E is absent -> avoid.\n\n""SPORT"" is S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test P, O, T.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and S? \nFor R: we know it\'s not at position 1. In ""SPORT"", R is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so it\'s ok.\nFor S: we know it\'s not at position 4. In ""SPORT"", S is at position 1 -> that\'s a new position, so ok.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. But we are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes T and N? But we have only 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""STERN"" -> but E is absent, so avoid.\n\n""STURN"" -> S(1), T(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, U, N.\n\nBut ""STURN"" might be less common.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: is ""SPORT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a type of sport or a competition.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""SPORT"".\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and S. In ""SPORT"", we are putting R at position 4 and S at position 1.\n\nWe might get feedback that tells us if R is at 4 and S at 1? Or if not, then we know they are elsewhere.\n\nAlso, we test P, O, T.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SPORT"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has the letter O? We don\'t know. So we are testing O.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and S and also includes N and T? But we have to avoid A,I,E.\n\nWord: ""STORN"" (a verb meaning to disturb) -> S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). \n- R at 4 (ok).\n- S at 1 (ok).\n\nWe test T, O, N.\n\nBut ""STORN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to disturb.\n\nBut I think ""SPORT"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SPORT"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the word but not at position 1.\n- S is in the word but not at position 4.\n- A, I, E are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes R and S (since they are in the word) but avoids placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.\n- Excludes A, I, E.\n- Tests new common letters like P, O, T to gather more information.\n\nI considered words such as ""CURBS"" (R at position 3, S at position 5) and ""STORK"" (R at position 4, S at position 1), but settled on ""SPORT"" because it places R and S in positions that are not yet ruled out and tests three new common letters: P, O, T.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)\n- A: absent\n- I: absent\n- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 4)\n- E: absent\n\nGuess 2: SPORT\n- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)\n- P: absent\n- O: absent\n- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 4)\n- T: absent\n\nSo, from all this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letters R and S (and we know they are not at the positions we guessed).\n2. The secret word does not have A, I, E, P, O, T.\n\nAlso, from the positions:\n- S is fixed at position 1 (because in SPORT, S is at position 1 and it\'s correct).\n- R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we know it\'s not at position 1 from the first guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T.\n\nWe have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: must be S (because S is correct at position 1 in the second guess).\n\nSo the word starts with S.\n\n- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: position 5 is available for R? Yes, because we haven\'t tested R at position 5 yet.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we know S and R are in the word, but we don\'t know the other two).\n\nWe must avoid the letters: A, I, E, P, O, T.\n\nWe can use other common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n- Starts with S.\n- Contains R (at position 2,3, or 5) and the other R? (we don\'t know if there are duplicates, but we\'ll avoid for now).\n- Does not contain A,I,E,P,O,T.\n\nAlso, we should try to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for R:\n- Position 2: then the word is S R _ _ _\n- Position 3: then word is S _ R _ _\n- Position 5: then word is S _ _ _ R\n\nWe need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these possibilities and also test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with S and have R in one of the positions 2,3,5, but avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\nCommon letters to test: L, N, U, D, C, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must have two more letters (since we have S and R, and three more letters total? Actually, we know the word has R and S, and two more letters that are not A,I,E,P,O,T).\n\nBut we don\'t know the other letters. We should try to include letters that are common and that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should avoid using letters we know are absent: A,I,E,P,O,T.\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word that starts with S, has R in position 2,3, or 5, and uses new letters.\n\nOption 1: put R at position 2. Then the word is S R _ _ _\nWe need to fill the last three positions with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence). But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t forbid duplicates, but in the example, there were no duplicates. However, we should avoid using R and S again in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. Similarly for S.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should try new letters. So for the third and fourth positions, we can use new letters, and for the fifth, we can use R? But we don\'t know if R is at position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid R and S in the positions we are testing? But we need to use them elsewhere.\n\nBut note: we have only two known letters: S and R. So we should include both? Actually, we can use one of them only if we have to, but we want to test new letters.\n\nBut we must include R and S because we know they are in the word? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without R or S? But we know they are in the word, so if we don\'t include them, we might not get information about their positions. However, the rules don\'t require that we use known letters, but it\'s efficient to do so.\n\nWe can use a word that includes R and S in positions we haven\'t ruled out, and then test new letters in the other positions.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words.\n\nFirst, with R at position 2: S R _ _ _\nWe need to fill with letters not in {A,I,E,P,O,T} and not R or S (unless we suspect duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence). Also, the letters must be in the word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SCRUB"": S(1), R(2), C(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. But we have to check if it\'s valid. Yes, ""scrub"" is a word.\n- ""SERUM"": S(1), R(2), E(3) -> but E is forbidden! We know E is absent. So avoid.\n- ""SERUM"" has E -> invalid.\n- ""SHRUB"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), B(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, B are new. Valid word.\n- ""SHRUG"": S(1), R(2), H(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.\n- ""SKRIM"": S(1), R(2), K(3), I(4) -> but I is forbidden! We know I is absent. So avoid.\n- ""SLURP"": S(1), R(2), L(3), U(4), P(5) -> P is forbidden! Avoid.\n- ""SWIRL"": S(1), R(2), W(3), I(4) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.\n\nSo without I and P, we have:\n- ""SCRUB"": S, R, C, U, B -> all new letters? C, U, B are new. And no forbidden letters.\n- ""SHRUB"": S, R, H, U, B -> H, U, B new.\n- ""SHRUG"": S, R, H, U, G -> H, U, G new.\n- ""SKRIM"": invalid because of I.\n- ""SLURP"": invalid because of P and I.\n- ""SWIRL"": invalid because of I.\n\nAlso, with R at position 3: S _ R _ _\nWe need to fill the first two and last positions? Actually, positions 1 and 2 are fixed as S and then a letter, then R at 3.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SNORT"": S(1), N(2), O(3) -> O is forbidden! Avoid.\n- ""STERN"": S(1), T(2) -> T is forbidden? T is absent, so we cannot use T. And E is also forbidden. So avoid.\n- ""SHIRT"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I is forbidden! Avoid.\n- ""SCARF"": S(1), C(2), A(3) -> A and I are forbidden? A and I are absent, so avoid.\n- ""SCUR"": only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\nActually, ""SCUR"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n- ""SHARD"": S(1), H(2), A(3) -> A forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""SHIRE"": S(1), H(2), I(3) -> I forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""SHRUG"": S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? H, U, G are new. Valid word.\n\nWith R at position 5: S _ _ _ R\nPossible words:\n- ""SANDY"": S(1), A(2) -> A forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have S at 1 and then U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. But we know S is at 1, so that\'s fixed. Then R at 5 is a new position. But we have to avoid A,I,E,P,O,T. So ""SUNNY"" is S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? U, N are new. But note: we have two N\'s? That\'s acceptable? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are testing U and N.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we can try without duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two known letters: S and R. We need to place them in positions that are not ruled out and test new letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 and then test common consonants and vowels (but vowels are limited: we know A,I,E are absent, so only O,U (and Y) are left? And sometimes W, etc.).\n\nBut we have U and O? We know O is absent, so we cannot use O. So we are left with U and Y (as vowel).\n\nSo for the word with R at position 2: S R U _ _ ? But we need a 5-letter word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SCRUB"": S R U C B -> avoids forbidden letters? C, U, B are new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUB"": S R U H B -> H, B new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUG"": S R U H G -> H, G new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUB"" and ""SHRUG"" are similar.\n\nWith R at position 3: S _ R _ _\nWe need a vowel? We have U? But we can try.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> H, U, G new. Valid.\n- ""SHRUB"": S H R U B -> H, U, B new. Valid.\n\nWith R at position 5: S _ _ _ R\nWe need a vowel? U is available.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SUNNY"": S U N N Y -> U, N, Y new. But note: we have two N\'s? And we don\'t know if N is in the word. Also, Y is a vowel? But we can try. But we have U and N.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters.\n\nI think ""SCRUB"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests C, U, B.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? That might be less common.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two known letters: S and R. We can try to put R at position 2 and then test common letters.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid.\n\nI think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: the secret word has S at position 1 and R somewhere else. In ""SCRUB"", we put R at position 2 and U at 4, B at 5.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3 for R. So maybe we should test R at position 3? But we can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 3? But we don\'t have a good candidate without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example, ""SHRUG"" has R at position 3? Let me see: S H R U G -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:U, 5:G. So R is at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHRUB"" has R at position 3.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut ""SHRUG"" tests H, U, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHRUB"" for the same.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are safe.\n\nI think ""SHRUB"" is a good choice because it tests H, U, B.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have S at 1, then H at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.\n\nWe know R is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3. If it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we know R is not at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we test H, U, B.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SHRUB"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has R at position 2? Then ""SHRUB"" or ""SHRUG"" would test R at position 3? But we are not testing position 2? Actually, in ""SHRUB"", R is at position 3, so we are not testing position 2.\n\nWe need to test position 2? We can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 2? But we don\'t have a good candidate without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example, ""SCRUB"" has R at 2.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid.\n\nI think ""SCRUB"" is a good choice.\n\nSo the third guess is ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- S at 1: we know S is at 1, so it will be ✓.\n- R at 2: we are testing if R is at 2.\n- C at 3: new letter.\n- U at 4: new vowel? We know A,I,E are absent, so U is okay.\n- B at 5: new letter.\n\nSo we\'ll get feedback on all these.\n\nSo the guess is ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word has R at position 5? Then ""SCRUB"" would have R at 2? That might be wrong. But we are testing R at 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5? But we don\'t have a good candidate without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example, ""SUNNY"" has R at 5? But it has U and N? And N is common.\n\nBut ""SUNNY"" has U and N? And avoids forbidden letters? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), R(5). But we have two N\'s? That might be confusing? But the feedback will mark each letter separately.\n\nBut we are testing: U at 2, N at 3, and R at 5. Also, we are testing if N is in the word and if U is in the word.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has U or N.\n\nBut we can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two S\'s? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that S is present but wrong position? But we already know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, and if the word has only one S, then we\'ll get a \'-\' for S at 5? But if the word has two S\'s, then we might get a check for S at 5? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, let\'s stick with ""SCRUB"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut let me think: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SCRUB"" has S, R, C, U, B -> no A,I,E,P,O,T. Good.\n\nSo the guess is ""SCRUB"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has C, U, B. We are testing them.\n\nSo <guess>SCRUB</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S is correct at position 1).\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2). So R must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n- The letters A, I, E, P, O, T are absent.\n\nFor the third guess, I need to test the position of R and also test new common letters. I chose ""SCRUB"" because:\n- It starts with S (which we know is correct).\n- It places R at position 2 (a position we haven\'t tested for R) to check if R is there.\n- It uses new letters (C, U, B) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (A, I, E, P, O, T).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on:\n- S at position 1: should be ✓ (correct).\n- R at position 2: if correct, we get a check; if not, we know R is not at position 2.\n- C at position 3: if present and correct, we get a check; if present but wrong position, we get \'-\'; if absent, we get \'x\'.\n- U at position 4: same.\n- B at position 5: same.\n\nThis will give us information about the positions of R and the presence of C, U, B.\n\n<guess>SCRUB</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 4: SCRUB -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(-) B(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 4: SCRUB -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(-) B(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, not at position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (so S is in the word, not at position 4)
- E: absent

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: correct position (so S is at position 1 in the secret word)
- P: absent
- O: absent
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, not at position 4)
- T: absent

Guess 3: SCRUB
- S: correct position (as expected)
- C: absent
- R: correct position (so R is at position 3)
- U: present but wrong position (so U is in the word, but not at position 4)
- B: absent

So, from all feedback:

- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- U is in the word, but not at position 4. So U must be at position 2 or 5? (since position 1 is S and position 3 is R, and position 4 is not U)
- Letters absent: A, I, E, P, O, T, C, B.

We know the word is S _ R _ _

And U is present, but not at position 4. So U must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to find the remaining two letters.

The word has 5 letters: positions 2, 4, and 5 are unknown (but position 4 cannot be U, and we know U is at either 2 or 5).

We also know that the word does not contain: A, I, E, P, O, T, C, B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S and U are already known to be in the word, and we have R fixed at position 3.

So the word is: S _ R _ _

With U in the word, but not at position 4, so U must be at position 2 or 5.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent.

We also want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible positions for U:
- Position 2: then the word is S U R _ _
- Position 5: then the word is S _ R _ U

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between these and also test new letters.

We can try to put U at position 2 in our next guess? Or at position 5?

But we don't know which one is correct, so we might choose a word that tests one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has U at position 5? But we also want to test other letters.

We have two unknown positions: 2 and 4 (if U is at 5, then position 4 is unknown).

But we know U is not at position 4, so if we put U at position 5, we can test if it's correct.

Similarly, if we put U at position 2, we can test that.

But we also need to test the remaining letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, if U is at position 2: S U R _ _

We need to fill position 4 and 5 with letters not in the forbidden set and not R, S, U (unless duplicate, but we don't have evidence).

Forbidden: A,I,E,P,O,T,C,B.

So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But S and U are already used, but they might be duplicated? But we don't know.

We should avoid using S and U again in positions we already know are wrong? But we don't have information about other positions.

But note: in position 4 and 5, we can use any letter except the forbidden ones.

Possible words with U at position 2:
- ""SURLY"": S U R L Y -> L and Y are new. Valid.
- ""SURFS"": S U R F S -> S is repeated? But we know S is at position 1, and if we put S at position 5, it might be correct? But we don't know if S is at position 5. Also, we have two S's? The feedback might be ambiguous? But let's see: if the word has two S's, then we can test it.

But we should avoid using S at position 5 because we already know S is at position 1? Actually, we don't know if S is at position 5. We only know that S is not at position 4 (from first guess) and we have it at 1, so it could be at 5.

But to avoid confusion, we might avoid using S again? But we need to test.

Alternatively, we can avoid S at position 5 and use a new letter.

But let's think of words without duplicate S.

- ""SURLY"": S U R L Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. Tests L and Y.

- ""SURLY"" is a valid word.

- ""SURLY"" might be good.

- ""SURFS"": S U R F S -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:R, 4:F, 5:S. But we have S at position 5? We don't know if S is at position 5. Also, we are testing F and the second S? But we know S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, we might get feedback that it's present but wrong position? But if the word has two S's, it could be correct.

But we are trying to find the word, so we can use it.

However, let's avoid using S at position 5 because we already know S is at position 1, and we want to test new letters.

So ""SURLY"" is better because it tests L and Y without S at 5.

Similarly, we can try U at position 5.

So let's consider both.

First, U at position 2: S U R _ _

Possible words:
- ""SURLY"" (S U R L Y)
- ""SURLY"" is valid.
- ""SURLY"" is good.
