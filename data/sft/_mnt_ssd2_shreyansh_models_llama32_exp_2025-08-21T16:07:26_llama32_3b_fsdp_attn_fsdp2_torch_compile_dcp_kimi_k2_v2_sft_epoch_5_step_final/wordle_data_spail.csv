### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, wrong position)
- I: - (in the word, wrong position)
- S: - (in the word, wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So the secret word contains A, I, and S, but they are not in the positions they occupied in RAISE (A-2nd, I-3rd, S-4th). R and E are not present.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A, I, and S
2. Does not include R or E
3. Has A, I, and S in different positions than 2, 3, 4 respectively

Possible positions for A, I, S:
- A cannot be 2nd
- I cannot be 3rd
- S cannot be 4th

Let me think of words with A, I, and S but no R or E. Some candidates:
- A and I could be in other vowels/consonants, and S could join them or go alone.
- Examples: ""ADIOS"" (but O is new, S at end), ""SALTY"" (but T,Y are new), ""PAINT"" (but N,T are new), ""SAINT"" (but N,T are new).

Looking at these:
- ADIOS: A(1), D(2), I(3), O(4), S(5) - S is 5th (was 4th in RAISE, so ok)
- SALTY: S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) - A is 2nd (was 2nd in RAISE, so this is same position - not good)
- PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) - same issue as SALTY, A is 2nd
- SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) - again A is 2nd

Better candidates:
- ADIOS: A(1), D(2), I(3), O(4), S(5) - A, I are in new positions (1,3), S is in new position (5)
- SIGHT: S(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) - S is 1st, I is 2nd (was 3rd in RAISE, so ok)
- TISUE: T(1), I(2), S(3), U(4), E(5) - but E is not in word (from feedback)

""SIGHT"" seems good:
- S is 1st (was 4th in RAISE, so new position)
- I is 2nd (was 3rd in RAISE, so new position)
- G and H are new letters, but we need to test other consonants/vowels

1. Word starts with S.
2. Contains A and I (but A is not in 2nd position, I is not in 2nd position).
3. Does NOT contain R, E, G, H, T.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have S _ _ _ _ so far. We need to place A and I in positions 2-5, avoiding their previous wrong spots (A not 2nd, I not 2nd).

Possible positions for A and I:
- A could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- I could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 2nd)

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and I and no R/E/G/H/T:

- SAIL_ – but need 5 letters, and T is out.
- SAINT – T is out.
- SAVIN – T is out.
- SABIN – T is out.
- SADLY – T is out.
- SALAD – D is ok, but second A is 4th, first A is 2nd (no, A cannot be 2nd).
- SIALS – S is already used in 1st, and S cannot appear again (no info yet on duplicates).
- SAPPY – P, Y are new, but A is 2nd (invalid).
- SAUCY – C, U, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SING_ – G is out.
- SINK_ – K is new, but T is out.
- SNAKY – N, K, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SWAMI – W, M are new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: this could work. Let’s check:
   - S W A M I: A is 3rd (allowed), I is 5th (allowed), no R/E/G/H/T. This seems valid.

Another candidate: S P A I N – but N is new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: SPAIN. However, this doesn’t seem as common.

Possible positions for A and I:
- A could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- I could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 2nd)

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and I and no R/E/G/H/T:

- SAIL_ – but need 5 letters, and T is out.
- SAINT – T is out.
- SAVIN – T is out.
- SABIN – T is out.
- SADLY – T is out.
- SALAD – D is ok, but second A is 4th, first A is 2nd (no, A cannot be 2nd).
- SIALS – S is already used in 1st, and S cannot appear again (no info yet on duplicates).
- SAPPY – P, Y are new, but A is 2nd (invalid).
- SAUCY – C, U, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SING_ – G is out.
- SINK_ – K is new, but T is out.
- SNAKY – N, K, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SWAMI – W, M are new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: this could work. Let’s check:
   - S W A M I: A is 3rd (allowed), I is 5th (allowed), no R/E/G/H/T. This seems valid.

Another candidate: S P A I N – but N is new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: SPAIN. However, this doesn’t seem as common.

""SWAMI"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, wrong position)
- I: - (in the word, wrong position)
- S: - (in the word, wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So the secret word contains A, I, and S, but they are not in the positions they occupied in RAISE (A-2nd, I-3rd, S-4th). R and E are not present.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A, I, and S
2. Does not include R or E
3. Has A, I, and S in different positions than 2, 3, 4 respectively

Possible positions for A, I, S:
- A cannot be 2nd
- I cannot be 3rd
- S cannot be 4th

Let me think of words with A, I, and S but no R or E. Some candidates:
- A and I could be in other vowels/consonants, and S could join them or go alone.
- Examples: ""ADIOS"" (but O is new, S at end), ""SALTY"" (but T,Y are new), ""PAINT"" (but N,T are new), ""SAINT"" (but N,T are new).

Looking at these:
- ADIOS: A(1), D(2), I(3), O(4), S(5) - S is 5th (was 4th in RAISE, so ok)
- SALTY: S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) - A is 2nd (was 2nd in RAISE, so this is same position - not good)
- PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) - same issue as SALTY, A is 2nd
- SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) - again A is 2nd

Better candidates:
- ADIOS: A(1), D(2), I(3), O(4), S(5) - A, I are in new positions (1,3), S is in new position (5)
- SIGHT: S(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) - S is 1st, I is 2nd (was 3rd in RAISE, so ok)
- TISUE: T(1), I(2), S(3), U(4), E(5) - but E is not in word (from feedback)

""SIGHT"" seems good:
- S is 1st (was 4th in RAISE, so new position)
- I is 2nd (was 3rd in RAISE, so new position)
- G and H are new letters, but we need to test other consonants/vowels

<guess>SIGHT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (RAISE):
- R, E are NOT in the word.
- A, I, S ARE in the word but in wrong positions.

Round 2 (SIGHT):
- S is in the word AND in the correct 1st position.
- I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- G, H, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S.
2. Contains A and I (but A is not in 2nd position, I is not in 2nd position).
3. Does NOT contain R, E, G, H, T.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have S _ _ _ _ so far. We need to place A and I in positions 2-5, avoiding their previous wrong spots (A not 2nd, I not 2nd).

Possible positions for A and I:
- A could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- I could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 2nd)

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and I and no R/E/G/H/T:

- SAIL_ – but need 5 letters, and T is out.
- SAINT – T is out.
- SAVIN – T is out.
- SABIN – T is out.
- SADLY – T is out.
- SALAD – D is ok, but second A is 4th, first A is 2nd (no, A cannot be 2nd).
- SIALS – S is already used in 1st, and S cannot appear again (no info yet on duplicates).
- SAPPY – P, Y are new, but A is 2nd (invalid).
- SAUCY – C, U, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SING_ – G is out.
- SINK_ – K is new, but T is out.
- SNAKY – N, K, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SWAMI – W, M are new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: this could work. Let’s check:
   - S W A M I: A is 3rd (allowed), I is 5th (allowed), no R/E/G/H/T. This seems valid.

Another candidate: S P A I N – but N is new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: SPAIN. However, this doesn’t seem as common.

""SWAMI"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with SWAMI.

<guess>SIGHT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (RAISE):
- R, E are NOT in the word.
- A, I, S ARE in the word but in wrong positions.

Round 2 (SIGHT):
- S is in the word AND in the correct 1st position.
- I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- G, H, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S.
2. Contains A and I (but A is not in 2nd position, I is not in 2nd position).
3. Does NOT contain R, E, G, H, T.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have S _ _ _ _ so far. We need to place A and I in positions 2-5, avoiding their previous wrong spots (A not 2nd, I not 2nd).

Possible positions for A and I:
- A could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- I could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 2nd)

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and I and no R/E/G/H/T:

- SAIL_ – but need 5 letters, and T is out.
- SAINT – T is out.
- SAVIN – T is out.
- SABIN – T is out.
- SADLY – T is out.
- SALAD – D is ok, but second A is 4th, first A is 2nd (no, A cannot be 2nd).
- SIALS – S is already used in 1st, and S cannot appear again (no info yet on duplicates).
- SAPPY – P, Y are new, but A is 2nd (invalid).
- SAUCY – C, U, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SING_ – G is out.
- SINK_ – K is new, but T is out.
- SNAKY – N, K, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SWAMI – W, M are new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: this could work. Let’s check:
   - S W A M I: A is 3rd (allowed), I is 5th (allowed), no R/E/G/H/T. This seems valid.

Another candidate: S P A I N – but N is new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: SPAIN. However, this doesn’t seem as common.

""SWAMI"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with SWAMI.

<guess>SWAMI</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SWAMI -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) A(✓) M(x) I(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)  
   - A, I, S are in the word but misplaced.

2. SIGHT → S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
   - S is correctly placed in 1st position.  
   - I is in the word but not 2nd.  
   - G, H, T are not in the word.

3. SWAMI → S(✓) W(x) A(✓) M(x) I(-)  
   - S is still correct in 1st.  
   - A is now correctly placed in 3rd.  
   - I is in the word but not 5th.  
   - W, M are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Must contain I (not in 2nd or 5th).

So I must be in 4th position.
- Remaining letters: must be from allowed set (no R, E, G, H, T, W, M).
- Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
- Allowed vowels: only U is left (A is used, I is used, E is out).

So the word is S _ A I _ .
We need a 5-letter word fitting S _ A I _ .

Possible letters for 2nd and 5th positions: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- S B A I L – not a word.
- S C A I L – not a word.
- S D A I L – not a word.
- S F A I D – not a word.
- S P A I N – SPAIN is a valid word, but I is 4th, A is 3rd, fits S _ A I _ .
- S L A I N – SLAIN is a valid word (archaic for ""slain in battle""), but less common.
- S C A I F – not a word.
- S N A I L – not a word.

SPAIN is the most common word fitting the pattern.

Let’s check:
S P A I N:
- S: 1st ✓
- P: new letter, allowed
- A: 3rd ✓
- I: 4th (allowed, since I cannot be 2nd or 5th)
- N: new letter, allowed

No forbidden letters, and all constraints satisfied.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, wrong position)
- I: - (in the word, wrong position)
- S: - (in the word, wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So the secret word contains A, I, and S, but they are not in the positions they occupied in RAISE (A-2nd, I-3rd, S-4th). R and E are not present.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A, I, and S
2. Does not include R or E
3. Has A, I, and S in different positions than 2, 3, 4 respectively

Possible positions for A, I, S:
- A cannot be 2nd
- I cannot be 3rd
- S cannot be 4th

Let me think of words with A, I, and S but no R or E. Some candidates:
- A and I could be in other vowels/consonants, and S could join them or go alone.
- Examples: ""ADIOS"" (but O is new, S at end), ""SALTY"" (but T,Y are new), ""PAINT"" (but N,T are new), ""SAINT"" (but N,T are new).

Looking at these:
- ADIOS: A(1), D(2), I(3), O(4), S(5) - S is 5th (was 4th in RAISE, so ok)
- SALTY: S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) - A is 2nd (was 2nd in RAISE, so this is same position - not good)
- PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) - same issue as SALTY, A is 2nd
- SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) - again A is 2nd

Better candidates:
- ADIOS: A(1), D(2), I(3), O(4), S(5) - A, I are in new positions (1,3), S is in new position (5)
- SIGHT: S(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) - S is 1st, I is 2nd (was 3rd in RAISE, so ok)
- TISUE: T(1), I(2), S(3), U(4), E(5) - but E is not in word (from feedback)

""SIGHT"" seems good:
- S is 1st (was 4th in RAISE, so new position)
- I is 2nd (was 3rd in RAISE, so new position)
- G and H are new letters, but we need to test other consonants/vowels

<guess>SIGHT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (RAISE):
- R, E are NOT in the word.
- A, I, S ARE in the word but in wrong positions.

Round 2 (SIGHT):
- S is in the word AND in the correct 1st position.
- I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- G, H, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S.
2. Contains A and I (but A is not in 2nd position, I is not in 2nd position).
3. Does NOT contain R, E, G, H, T.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have S _ _ _ _ so far. We need to place A and I in positions 2-5, avoiding their previous wrong spots (A not 2nd, I not 2nd).

Possible positions for A and I:
- A could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- I could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 2nd)

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and I and no R/E/G/H/T:

- SAIL_ – but need 5 letters, and T is out.
- SAINT – T is out.
- SAVIN – T is out.
- SABIN – T is out.
- SADLY – T is out.
- SALAD – D is ok, but second A is 4th, first A is 2nd (no, A cannot be 2nd).
- SIALS – S is already used in 1st, and S cannot appear again (no info yet on duplicates).
- SAPPY – P, Y are new, but A is 2nd (invalid).
- SAUCY – C, U, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SING_ – G is out.
- SINK_ – K is new, but T is out.
- SNAKY – N, K, Y are new, A is 2nd (invalid).
- SWAMI – W, M are new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: this could work. Let’s check:
   - S W A M I: A is 3rd (allowed), I is 5th (allowed), no R/E/G/H/T. This seems valid.

Another candidate: S P A I N – but N is new, but A is 3rd, I is 4th: SPAIN. However, this doesn’t seem as common.

""SWAMI"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with SWAMI.

<guess>SWAMI</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SWAMI -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) A(✓) M(x) I(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)  
   - A, I, S are in the word but misplaced.

2. SIGHT → S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
   - S is correctly placed in 1st position.  
   - I is in the word but not 2nd.  
   - G, H, T are not in the word.

3. SWAMI → S(✓) W(x) A(✓) M(x) I(-)  
   - S is still correct in 1st.  
   - A is now correctly placed in 3rd.  
   - I is in the word but not 5th.  
   - W, M are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Must contain I (not in 2nd or 5th).

So I must be in 4th position.
- Remaining letters: must be from allowed set (no R, E, G, H, T, W, M).
- Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
- Allowed vowels: only U is left (A is used, I is used, E is out).

So the word is S _ A I _ .
We need a 5-letter word fitting S _ A I _ .

Possible letters for 2nd and 5th positions: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- S B A I L – not a word.
- S C A I L – not a word.
- S D A I L – not a word.
- S F A I D – not a word.
- S P A I N – SPAIN is a valid word, but I is 4th, A is 3rd, fits S _ A I _ .
- S L A I N – SLAIN is a valid word (archaic for ""slain in battle""), but less common.
- S C A I F – not a word.
- S N A I L – not a word.

SPAIN is the most common word fitting the pattern.

Let’s check:
S P A I N:
- S: 1st ✓
- P: new letter, allowed
- A: 3rd ✓
- I: 4th (allowed, since I cannot be 2nd or 5th)
- N: new letter, allowed

No forbidden letters, and all constraints satisfied.

<guess>SPAIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)

Guess 4: SPAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback (SPAIN → S✓ P✓ A✓ I✓ Nx):

We now know the exact pattern: S P A I _  
Only the last letter is unknown.

All letters used so far (S, P, A, I, N) except the one in 5th position have been confirmed.  
Since N was marked x (not in the word), the 5th letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S P A I _ :

- SPAID – not a word  
- SPAIL – not a word  
- SPAIK – not a word  
- SPAIB – not a word  
- SPAIC – not a word  
- SPAID – not a word  
- SPAIK – not a word  
- SPAIB – not a word  
- SPAIC – not a word  

The only valid English word that fits S P A I _ and uses an allowed letter is:

SPAID – but “spa id” is not a valid word.  
SPAIC – not valid.  
SPAIB – not valid.  
SPAIE – E is out.  
SPAIG – G is out.  
SPAID – still not valid.

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words starting with SPAI:

- SPADE – but E is out.  
- SPAWN – W is out.  
- SPADES – E is out.  
- SPAIR – R is out.  
- SPAKE – K is allowed, and “SPAKE” is a valid word.

Let’s verify:  
S P A I K  
- S: 1st ✓  
- P: 2nd ✓  
- A: 3rd ✓  
- I: 4th ✓  
- K: new letter, allowed.

No conflicts.
