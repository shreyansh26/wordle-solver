For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:

- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

""BUSTY"" seems like a strong choice because B and U are common and unused so far, and it fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Letters: B, U, S, T, Y.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- T is in position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- No banned letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G) are used.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- S (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, or 4)
- T (must appear and is correctly placed in position 4)

Letters whose status is still unknown (never played or only played in wrong spot):
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (played in BUSTY but position unknown)

From BUSTY:
- U was played (but not in position 2)
- S was played (not in position 3)
- T was confirmed in position 4

So the word looks like: _ _ _ T _

Required letters: S and T (with T locked in position 4).

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Remaining usable letters: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (whose exact position is still unknown but not 2).

We need a 5-letter word ending in T_, containing S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 1,3,4 are ruled out for S), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ S _ T _  (S in position 2)
- _ _ S T _  (S in position 3) — but feedback says S is not in position 3 (from BUSTY: S was (-) in position 3), so this is invalid.
- _ _ _ T S  (S in position 5)

So only two viable patterns remain:
1. _ S _ T _
2. _ _ _ T S

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns, using the remaining letters.

Pattern 1 (_ S _ T _):
- Need a consonant in position 1 and 2, and a consonant in position 3.
- Possible: D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Examples:
- DUSTY – but Y is banned.
- FUSTY – Y banned.
- MUSTY – Y banned.
- LUSTY – Y banned.
- PUSTY – Y banned.

None seem valid.

Pattern 2 (_ _ _ T S):
- Need letters in positions 1, 2, 3 from the allowed set.
- Possible: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U.

Let’s try common combinations:
- D U _ T S → need a letter in position 3.
  - D U L T S – not a word.
  - D U C T S – not a word.
  - D U M T S – not a word.

- C U _ T S:
  - C U B T S – B is banned.
  - C U D T S – not a word.
  - C U L T S – not a word.
  - C U M T S – not a word.

- F U _ T S:
  - F U D T S – not a word.
  - F U L T S – not a word.
  - F U M T S – not a word.

- H U _ T S:
  - H U D T S – not a word.
  - H U L T S – not a word.
  - H U M T S – not a word.

- L U _ T S:
  - L U D T S – not a word.
  - L U M T S – not a word.

- M U _ T S:
  - M U D T S – not a word.
  - M U L T S – not a word.
  - M U C T S – not a word.

- P U _ T S:
  - P U D T S – not a word.
  - P U L T S – not a word.
  - P U C T S – not a word.

- V U _ T S:
  - V U D T S – not a word.
  - V U L T S – not a word.

- W U _ T S:
  - W U D T S – not a word.
  - W U L T S – not a word.

- X U _ T S:
  - X U D T S – not a word.
  - X U L T S – not a word.

- Z U _ T S:
  - Z U D T S – not a word.
  - Z U L T S – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words fitting _ _ _ T S with S in position 5.

Common words ending in T S:
- DUSTS – but S is in position 5, and D, U, S are allowed. However, ""DUSTS"" is a valid word (plural of dust).
  - Letters: D, U, S, T, S – but it has S in both positions 4 and 5, but T is already in position 4, so the second S would be in position 5. This fits our constraints: T is in 4, S is in 5 (allowed), and all letters are allowed.

But we already know T is in position 4, so the word is _ _ _ T S.

""DUSTS"" would be D U S T S, which fits: T in 4, S in 5, and all letters allowed.

Another possibility: ""FUSTS"" – but F, U, S, T, S – but F is allowed, U is allowed, S is in 5 (allowed), T in 4. This also fits.

Between DUSTS and FUSTS, both are valid, but let me pick the more common one: DUSTS.

But wait, in DUSTS, S appears twice. That's okay since the feedback only tells us about the position of S, not how many times it appears.

However, let me check if there's a word with unique letters. The pattern _ _ _ T S with S not in 1,3,4 gives us nothing common.

So DUSTS seems the best available option.

But let me double-check: is D, U, S, T, S valid? Yes, plural of dust.

But since T is already in position 4, and we have S in position 5, this fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is DUSTS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""STING"" or ""SLUMP"" or ""SPUNK"". These use S in different positions and incorporate other common letters.

Let me choose ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE)
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not yet tested
- Uses common letters T, I, N, G

<guess>STING</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1.
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, G are not in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, G.

Letters we know ARE in the word: S and T.

Positions we know:
- S is not in position 1 or 4.
- T is not in position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and T.
- Does not contain any of A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Places T somewhere other than position 2.

Let me think of words that fit:
Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the banned ones).

Good candidates:
- MUST contain S and T.
- CANNOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N, G.

Looking at common words:
- ""DUSTY"" – but Y is uncommon and D, U, S, T, Y are allowed. However, S is in position 4 here, which is banned.
- ""CUSTY"" – C, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3 (allowed), T in position 4 (allowed). This seems valid.
- ""MUSTY"" – M, U, S, T, Y. S in 3, T in 4. Allowed.
- ""BUSTY"" – B, U, S, T, Y. S in 3, T in 4. Allowed.

""BUSTY"" seems like a strong choice because B and U are common and unused so far, and it fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Letters: B, U, S, T, Y.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- T is in position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- No banned letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G) are used.

<guess>BUSTY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Remaining usable letters: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (whose exact position is still unknown but not 2).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words fitting _ _ _ T S with S in position 5.

Common words ending in T S:
- DUSTS – but S is in position 5, and D, U, S are allowed. However, ""DUSTS"" is a valid word (plural of dust).
  - Letters: D, U, S, T, S – but it has S in both positions 4 and 5, but T is already in position 4, so the second S would be in position 5. This fits our constraints: T is in 4, S is in 5 (allowed), and all letters are allowed.

But we already know T is in position 4, so the word is _ _ _ T S.

""DUSTS"" would be D U S T S, which fits: T in 4, S in 5, and all letters allowed.

Another possibility: ""FUSTS"" – but F, U, S, T, S – but F is allowed, U is allowed, S is in 5 (allowed), T in 4. This also fits.

Between DUSTS and FUSTS, both are valid, but let me pick the more common one: DUSTS.

But wait, in DUSTS, S appears twice. That's okay since the feedback only tells us about the position of S, not how many times it appears.

However, let me check if there's a word with unique letters. The pattern _ _ _ T S with S not in 1,3,4 gives us nothing common.

So DUSTS seems the best available option.

But let me double-check: is D, U, S, T, S valid? Yes, plural of dust.

But since T is already in position 4, and we have S in position 5, this fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is DUSTS.

Let’s update what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y, D

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from BUSTY and DUSTS feedback: S(-) in positions 3 and 5 respectively). So S must be in position 2.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from BUSTY: U(-)), so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 4 is T, so possible positions for U: 1, 3, or 5.

Current pattern:
- Position 4: T
- Position 2: S
- Position 5: unknown, but U could be here
- Positions 1 or 3: U could be here

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U and S (already placed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in _ S _ T _ with T in position 4, S in position 2, and U somewhere in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:
- U S _ T _ → need a letter in position 3.
  - U S C T _ – no valid word.
  - U S L T _ – no valid word.
  - U S M T _ – no valid word.

- _ S U T _ → need letters in positions 1 and 5.
  - C S U T _ – no valid word.
  - F S U T _ – no valid word.
  - H S U T _ – no valid word.
  - L S U T _ – no valid word.
  - M S U T _ – no valid word.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be _ S _ T _ with S in 2, T in 4, and U somewhere in 1 or 3.

Possible valid words:
- MUST contain S (position 2), T (position 4), U (position 1 or 3), and no banned letters.

Looking at common words:
- ""FUSTS"" – but S appears twice, and F, U, S, T, S – S is in 2 and 5, but S is already in 2, so the second S in 5 would be extra. But we don't know if S appears twice. Not ideal.

- ""HUSTS"" – same issue.

- ""MUSTS"" – same.

- ""LUSTS"" – same.

- ""CUSTS"" – but C, U, S, T, S – again S twice.

- ""PUSTS"" – not a word.

- ""FUSTS"" – not a standard word.

- ""WUSTS"" – not a word.

- ""FUSTS"" is not valid.

Let me re-examine: we have _ S _ T _ with S in 2, T in 4, and U must be in 1 or 3.

Valid dictionary words fitting this:
- ""FUSTS"" – invalid
- ""HUSTS"" – invalid
- ""LUSTS"" – invalid
- ""MUSTS"" – invalid
- ""PUSTS"" – invalid
- ""WUSTS"" – invalid

This suggests we might need to accept that S could appear twice, but since the feedback never indicated duplicate letters, and we have only one S confirmed, we should avoid double S.

Re-evaluate: maybe I missed a word where U is in position 3.

_ S U T _:
- Need a letter in position 1 and 5, with no banned letters.

Possible:
- C S U T _ – no
- F S U T _ – no
- H S U T _ – no
- L S U T _ – no
- M S U T _ – no

This is problematic. Let me try U in position 1.

U S _ T _:
- Need a letter in position 3 and 5, but 5 is already T, so position 3.

U S _ T _:
- U S C T _ – no
- U S L T _ – no
- U S M T _ – no

Hmm, none seem valid.

Wait, let me think of ""FUSTS"" as a possible valid word (though uncommon), or perhaps I missed a word.

Actually, the word ""FUSTS"" is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling of ""musty"" but with S in position 2 and 5. But we have T in 4, so position 5 would be T, but our pattern is _ S _ T _.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5 (which we already knew from BUSTY: S not in 3)
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S in position 5

But this creates a contradiction: earlier feedback says S is not in position 3 (from BUSTY), and now we have S in position 5 confirmed. This implies S must appear twice, which seems unlikely.

Wait, let me carefully re-examine the feedback:

From BUSTY:
- B(x) – B not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- Y(x) – Y not in word

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S in position 5

This is impossible because S cannot be in position 5 according to BUSTY feedback (S(-) in position 3 implies S is not in 3, but no restriction on 5 is provided, so S could be in 5). But the feedback S(✓) in DUSTS implies S is in position 5. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me carefully parse the feedback:

From BUSTY:
- B(x) – B not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- Y(x) – Y not in word

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S is in position 5

This is consistent: S is in position 5 (confirmed by S(✓)), and T is in position 4 (confirmed by T(✓)). The fact that U is in the word but not in position 2 is separate.

So the word is: _ S _ T S

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with allowed letters: C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (since U must be in the word, and positions 2 and 4 are taken).

Possible words:
- C S U T S – ""CUSTS"" – not a valid word
- F S U T S – ""FUSTS"" – valid (though rare)
- H S U T S – ""HUSTS"" – not valid
- L S U T S – ""LUSTS"" – not valid
- M S U T S – ""MUSTS"" – not valid
- P S U T S – ""PUSTS"" – not valid

The only valid word fitting _ S _ T S is ""FUSTS"".

But let me check if there's another word: ""WUSTS"" – invalid.

""WUSTS"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word is ""FUSTS"".

However, ""FUSTS"" is a obscure variant, but it's listed in some dictionaries.

Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word.

But wait, let me double-check: are there other valid words?

Another approach: maybe position 1 is U, position 3 is another letter.

_ S U T S:
- Need position 1 and 3 letters from allowed set.

Possible:
- C S U T S – invalid
- F S U T S – invalid
- H S U T S – invalid
- L S U T S – invalid
- M S U T S – invalid

No valid words.

Thus, the only possible word is ""FUSTS"".

But let me think: perhaps I missed a word where U is in position 1.

U S _ T _:
- U S C T _ – invalid
- U S L T _ – invalid
- U S M T _ – invalid

No valid words.

This suggests the word must be ""FUSTS"".

Therefore, the next guess is FUSTS.

But wait, let me check if ""FUSTS"" is the correct word: is it in common use?

""FUSTS"" is a valid word (as in musty odor), though rare.

Given the constraints, this seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is FUSTS.
</think>

Based on the updated constraints, the only possible word fitting the pattern _ S _ T S with S in position 2, T in 4, and U somewhere (but not in position 2), is ""FUSTS"".

Let me re-examine: we have _ S _ T _ with S in 2, T in 4, and U must be in 1 or 3.

Valid dictionary words fitting this:

- T(✓) – T in position 4
- Y(x) – Y not in word

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S in position 5

This is impossible because S cannot be in position 5 according to BUSTY feedback (S(-) in position 3 implies S is not in 3, but no restriction on 5 is provided, so S could be in 5). But the feedback S(✓) in DUSTS implies S is in position 5. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me carefully parse the feedback:

From BUSTY:
- B(x) – B not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- Y(x) – Y not in word

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S is in position 5

This is consistent: S is in position 5 (confirmed by S(✓)), and T is in position 4 (confirmed by T(✓)). The fact that U is in the word but not in position 2 is separate.

So the word is: _ S _ T S

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with allowed letters: C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (since U must be in the word, and positions 2 and 4 are taken).

Possible words:
- C S U T S – ""CUSTS"" – not a valid word
- F S U T S – ""FUSTS"" – valid (though rare)
- H S U T S – ""HUSTS"" – not valid
- L S U T S – ""LUSTS"" – not valid
- M S U T S – ""MUSTS"" – not valid
- P S U T S – ""PUSTS"" – not valid

The only valid word fitting _ S _ T S is ""FUSTS"".

But let me check if there's another word: ""WUSTS"" – invalid.

""WUSTS"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word is ""FUSTS"".

However, ""FUSTS"" is a obscure variant, but it's listed in some dictionaries.

Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word.

But wait, let me double-check: are there other valid words?

Another approach: maybe position 1 is U, position 3 is another letter.

_ S U T S:
- Need position 1 and 3 letters from allowed set.

Possible:
- C S U T S – invalid
- F S U T S – invalid
- H S U T S – invalid
- L S U T S – invalid
- M S U T S – invalid

No valid words.

Thus, the only possible word is ""FUSTS"".

But let me think: perhaps I missed a word where U is in position 1.

U S _ T _:
- U S C T _ – invalid
- U S L T _ – invalid
- U S M T _ – invalid

No valid words.

This suggests the word must be ""FUSTS"".

Therefore, the next guess is FUSTS.

But wait, let me check if ""FUSTS"" is the correct word: is it in common use?

""FUSTS"" is a valid word (as in musty odor), though rare.

Given the constraints, this seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is FUSTS.Based on the updated constraints, the only possible word fitting the pattern _ S _ T S with S in position 2, T in 4, and U somewhere (but not in position 2), is ""FUSTS"".",Guess 5: FUSTS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""STING"" or ""SLUMP"" or ""SPUNK"". These use S in different positions and incorporate other common letters.

Let me choose ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE)
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not yet tested
- Uses common letters T, I, N, G

<guess>STING</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1.
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, G are not in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, G.

Letters we know ARE in the word: S and T.

Positions we know:
- S is not in position 1 or 4.
- T is not in position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and T.
- Does not contain any of A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Places T somewhere other than position 2.

Let me think of words that fit:
Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the banned ones).

Good candidates:
- MUST contain S and T.
- CANNOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N, G.

Looking at common words:
- ""DUSTY"" – but Y is uncommon and D, U, S, T, Y are allowed. However, S is in position 4 here, which is banned.
- ""CUSTY"" – C, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3 (allowed), T in position 4 (allowed). This seems valid.
- ""MUSTY"" – M, U, S, T, Y. S in 3, T in 4. Allowed.
- ""BUSTY"" – B, U, S, T, Y. S in 3, T in 4. Allowed.

""BUSTY"" seems like a strong choice because B and U are common and unused so far, and it fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Letters: B, U, S, T, Y.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- T is in position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- No banned letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G) are used.

<guess>BUSTY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: BUSTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- S (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, or 4)
- T (must appear and is correctly placed in position 4)

Letters whose status is still unknown (never played or only played in wrong spot):
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (played in BUSTY but position unknown)

From BUSTY:
- U was played (but not in position 2)
- S was played (not in position 3)
- T was confirmed in position 4

So the word looks like: _ _ _ T _

Required letters: S and T (with T locked in position 4).

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Remaining usable letters: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (whose exact position is still unknown but not 2).

We need a 5-letter word ending in T_, containing S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 1,3,4 are ruled out for S), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ S _ T _  (S in position 2)
- _ _ S T _  (S in position 3) — but feedback says S is not in position 3 (from BUSTY: S was (-) in position 3), so this is invalid.
- _ _ _ T S  (S in position 5)

So only two viable patterns remain:
1. _ S _ T _
2. _ _ _ T S

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns, using the remaining letters.

Pattern 1 (_ S _ T _):
- Need a consonant in position 1 and 2, and a consonant in position 3.
- Possible: D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Examples:
- DUSTY – but Y is banned.
- FUSTY – Y banned.
- MUSTY – Y banned.
- LUSTY – Y banned.
- PUSTY – Y banned.

None seem valid.

Pattern 2 (_ _ _ T S):
- Need letters in positions 1, 2, 3 from the allowed set.
- Possible: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U.

Let’s try common combinations:
- D U _ T S → need a letter in position 3.
  - D U L T S – not a word.
  - D U C T S – not a word.
  - D U M T S – not a word.

- C U _ T S:
  - C U B T S – B is banned.
  - C U D T S – not a word.
  - C U L T S – not a word.
  - C U M T S – not a word.

- F U _ T S:
  - F U D T S – not a word.
  - F U L T S – not a word.
  - F U M T S – not a word.

- H U _ T S:
  - H U D T S – not a word.
  - H U L T S – not a word.
  - H U M T S – not a word.

- L U _ T S:
  - L U D T S – not a word.
  - L U M T S – not a word.

- M U _ T S:
  - M U D T S – not a word.
  - M U L T S – not a word.
  - M U C T S – not a word.

- P U _ T S:
  - P U D T S – not a word.
  - P U L T S – not a word.
  - P U C T S – not a word.

- V U _ T S:
  - V U D T S – not a word.
  - V U L T S – not a word.

- W U _ T S:
  - W U D T S – not a word.
  - W U L T S – not a word.

- X U _ T S:
  - X U D T S – not a word.
  - X U L T S – not a word.

- Z U _ T S:
  - Z U D T S – not a word.
  - Z U L T S – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words fitting _ _ _ T S with S in position 5.

Common words ending in T S:
- DUSTS – but S is in position 5, and D, U, S are allowed. However, ""DUSTS"" is a valid word (plural of dust).
  - Letters: D, U, S, T, S – but it has S in both positions 4 and 5, but T is already in position 4, so the second S would be in position 5. This fits our constraints: T is in 4, S is in 5 (allowed), and all letters are allowed.

But we already know T is in position 4, so the word is _ _ _ T S.

""DUSTS"" would be D U S T S, which fits: T in 4, S in 5, and all letters allowed.

Another possibility: ""FUSTS"" – but F, U, S, T, S – but F is allowed, U is allowed, S is in 5 (allowed), T in 4. This also fits.

Between DUSTS and FUSTS, both are valid, but let me pick the more common one: DUSTS.

But wait, in DUSTS, S appears twice. That's okay since the feedback only tells us about the position of S, not how many times it appears.

However, let me check if there's a word with unique letters. The pattern _ _ _ T S with S not in 1,3,4 gives us nothing common.

So DUSTS seems the best available option.

But let me double-check: is D, U, S, T, S valid? Yes, plural of dust.

But since T is already in position 4, and we have S in position 5, this fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is DUSTS.

<guess>DUSTS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: BUSTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)
Guess 4: DUSTS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y, D

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from BUSTY and DUSTS feedback: S(-) in positions 3 and 5 respectively). So S must be in position 2.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from BUSTY: U(-)), so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 4 is T, so possible positions for U: 1, 3, or 5.

Current pattern:
- Position 4: T
- Position 2: S
- Position 5: unknown, but U could be here
- Positions 1 or 3: U could be here

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U and S (already placed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in _ S _ T _ with T in position 4, S in position 2, and U somewhere in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:
- U S _ T _ → need a letter in position 3.
  - U S C T _ – no valid word.
  - U S L T _ – no valid word.
  - U S M T _ – no valid word.

- _ S U T _ → need letters in positions 1 and 5.
  - C S U T _ – no valid word.
  - F S U T _ – no valid word.
  - H S U T _ – no valid word.
  - L S U T _ – no valid word.
  - M S U T _ – no valid word.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be _ S _ T _ with S in 2, T in 4, and U somewhere in 1 or 3.

Possible valid words:
- MUST contain S (position 2), T (position 4), U (position 1 or 3), and no banned letters.

Looking at common words:
- ""FUSTS"" – but S appears twice, and F, U, S, T, S – S is in 2 and 5, but S is already in 2, so the second S in 5 would be extra. But we don't know if S appears twice. Not ideal.

- ""HUSTS"" – same issue.

- ""MUSTS"" – same.

- ""LUSTS"" – same.

- ""CUSTS"" – but C, U, S, T, S – again S twice.

- ""PUSTS"" – not a word.

- ""FUSTS"" – not a standard word.

- ""WUSTS"" – not a word.

- ""FUSTS"" is not valid.

Let me re-examine: we have _ S _ T _ with S in 2, T in 4, and U must be in 1 or 3.

Valid dictionary words fitting this:
- ""FUSTS"" – invalid
- ""HUSTS"" – invalid
- ""LUSTS"" – invalid
- ""MUSTS"" – invalid
- ""PUSTS"" – invalid
- ""WUSTS"" – invalid

This suggests we might need to accept that S could appear twice, but since the feedback never indicated duplicate letters, and we have only one S confirmed, we should avoid double S.

Re-evaluate: maybe I missed a word where U is in position 3.

_ S U T _:
- Need a letter in position 1 and 5, with no banned letters.

Possible:
- C S U T _ – no
- F S U T _ – no
- H S U T _ – no
- L S U T _ – no
- M S U T _ – no

This is problematic. Let me try U in position 1.

U S _ T _:
- Need a letter in position 3 and 5, but 5 is already T, so position 3.

U S _ T _:
- U S C T _ – no
- U S L T _ – no
- U S M T _ – no

Hmm, none seem valid.

Wait, let me think of ""FUSTS"" as a possible valid word (though uncommon), or perhaps I missed a word.

Actually, the word ""FUSTS"" is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling of ""musty"" but with S in position 2 and 5. But we have T in 4, so position 5 would be T, but our pattern is _ S _ T _.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5 (which we already knew from BUSTY: S not in 3)
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S in position 5

But this creates a contradiction: earlier feedback says S is not in position 3 (from BUSTY), and now we have S in position 5 confirmed. This implies S must appear twice, which seems unlikely.

Wait, let me carefully re-examine the feedback:

From BUSTY:
- B(x) – B not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- Y(x) – Y not in word

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S in position 5

This is impossible because S cannot be in position 5 according to BUSTY feedback (S(-) in position 3 implies S is not in 3, but no restriction on 5 is provided, so S could be in 5). But the feedback S(✓) in DUSTS implies S is in position 5. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me carefully parse the feedback:

From BUSTY:
- B(x) – B not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- Y(x) – Y not in word

From DUSTS:
- D(x) – D not in word
- U(-) – U is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5
- T(✓) – T in position 4
- S(✓) – S is in position 5

This is consistent: S is in position 5 (confirmed by S(✓)), and T is in position 4 (confirmed by T(✓)). The fact that U is in the word but not in position 2 is separate.

So the word is: _ S _ T S

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with allowed letters: C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U (since U must be in the word, and positions 2 and 4 are taken).

Possible words:
- C S U T S – ""CUSTS"" – not a valid word
- F S U T S – ""FUSTS"" – valid (though rare)
- H S U T S – ""HUSTS"" – not valid
- L S U T S – ""LUSTS"" – not valid
- M S U T S – ""MUSTS"" – not valid
- P S U T S – ""PUSTS"" – not valid

The only valid word fitting _ S _ T S is ""FUSTS"".

But let me check if there's another word: ""WUSTS"" – invalid.

""WUSTS"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word is ""FUSTS"".

However, ""FUSTS"" is a obscure variant, but it's listed in some dictionaries.

Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word.

But wait, let me double-check: are there other valid words?

Another approach: maybe position 1 is U, position 3 is another letter.

_ S U T S:
- Need position 1 and 3 letters from allowed set.

Possible:
- C S U T S – invalid
- F S U T S – invalid
- H S U T S – invalid
- L S U T S – invalid
- M S U T S – invalid

No valid words.

Thus, the only possible word is ""FUSTS"".

But let me think: perhaps I missed a word where U is in position 1.

U S _ T _:
- U S C T _ – invalid
- U S L T _ – invalid
- U S M T _ – invalid

No valid words.

This suggests the word must be ""FUSTS"".

Therefore, the next guess is FUSTS.

But wait, let me check if ""FUSTS"" is the correct word: is it in common use?

""FUSTS"" is a valid word (as in musty odor), though rare.

Given the constraints, this seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is FUSTS.Based on the updated constraints, the only possible word fitting the pattern _ S _ T S with S in position 2, T in 4, and U somewhere (but not in position 2), is ""FUSTS"".

- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from BUSTY and DUSTS/S feedback).  
  - BUSTY: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3  
  - DUSTS: S(✓) in position 5 → S is in 5  
  - But wait, the same feedback from DUSTS says S(✓) in position 5, which contradicts the earlier BUSTY feedback that S(-) in position 3 implies S is not in 3, but no restriction was ever stated about S in position 5.  
    Re-reading the feedback carefully:

   - BUSTY: B(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)

   - DUSTS: D(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)

   Remaining letters to try: C, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U.

   We need:
   - Position 1 and 3 letters from the allowed set.
   - The word must be _ S _ T S.

   Possible valid words:

   - M S U T S → “MUSTS” – invalid
   - P S U T S → “PUSTS” – invalid
   - W S U T S → “WUSTS” – invalid

   Realization: there are no common English 5-letter words ending in “S T _ S” with the remaining letters.  
   The only plausible candidate is “FUSTS”, but F was already ruled out (x in FUSTS feedback).

   Therefore, I must have missed a valid word. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible combinations.

   Actually, the word “LUSTS” is invalid (as above).  
   The correct realization is that the pattern is extremely restrictive. The only valid word fitting _ S _ T S with allowed letters is “CUSTS” – but it’s not a word. 

   After careful reconsideration, the only possible valid word is **CUSTS** – but it’s not in standard dictionaries. The correct valid word is **LUSTS** – but it was already ruled out.

   Realizing the mistake: the word must be **CUSTS** even though it’s listed as “obscure” or the dictionary may not have it, because standard Scrabble/Wordle dictionaries do include “CUSTS”.

   Therefore, the correct next guess is CUSTS.
