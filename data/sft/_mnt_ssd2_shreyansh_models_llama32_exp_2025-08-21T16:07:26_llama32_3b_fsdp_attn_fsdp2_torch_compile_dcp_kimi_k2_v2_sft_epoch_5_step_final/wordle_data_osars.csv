### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
2. It contains an S but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

I need a 5-letter word with A in the middle and an S somewhere after the first letter. I should also avoid L, T, and E.

Possible candidates:
- CHASM (but has an S in the 5th position - might be good)
- CRASH (but has an S in the 4th position, which might be good since S can't be 1st)
- BASIN (but has an S in the 4th position)
- DASH (but only 4 letters)
- GASP (but only 4 letters)

Looking at 5-letter words with _ _ A _ _ pattern and no L/T/E:
- CHASM: C H A S M - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- CRASH: C R A S H - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- VASAL (but has L-like structure)
- PANSY (but has S in 4th and Y may not be ideal)
- GASPY (but has S in 4th and Y)

CRASH seems good - uses common letters C, R, A, S, H, none of which are excluded.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E do not exist.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - C and H do not exist.

Known facts:
- Word must have A in position 3.
- Word must contain S (positions 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is taken by A, so 2 or 5).
- Word must contain R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, H, L, T, E.

Possible positions for S and R:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We also need to place R somewhere allowed.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words fitting these constraints:

1. _ S A _ _:
   - RSAB_ – but need valid word.
   - R S A _ _ – hard to form common word.
   - MS A _ _ – but M is allowed, N is allowed, etc.

2. _ _ A _ S:
   - This seems harder to form common words.
   - Need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and R in 4 (since R can’t be 2).

Possible candidate: “B R A N S” – but N is allowed, B and N not forbidden.
Check: B R A N S → A is 3rd ✓, S is 5th ✓, R is 2nd (but feedback said R is in word but wrong position in CRASH, where R was 2nd – so R cannot be 2nd). Thus BRANS fails because R is 2nd.

Next: “D R A N S” – R is 2nd again, fails.

Next: “G R A N S” – same issue.

Next: “F R A N S” – same.

Next: “P R A N S” – same.

Next: “B R A V S” – no.

Next: “B A R S” – too short.

Wait, we need 5 letters with A in 3rd, S somewhere, R somewhere, and no C/H/L/T/E.

Let’s try “BRAND” – but ends with D, not S.

Wait, we need S in 2nd or 5th, and R in 1st, 4th, or 5th, and A is fixed at 3rd.

  - “BSA…” – hard.
  - “MSA…” – no.
  - “NSA…” – no.
  - “PSA…” – no.
  - “RSA…” – no.
  - “WSA…” – no.

- _ _ A _ S:

  - “D R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “F R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “G R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “P R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “B R A I N S” – too long.
  - “B R A V S” – no.
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd.

Hmm, seems hard. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A in 3rd, containing S and R, no C/H/L/T/E.

Using a word list filter:
- “BRAND” – no, ends with D.
- “BRAUN” – no, ends with N.
- “GRAINS” – too long.
- “FRANK” – ends with K.
- “GRASP” – has P, S, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 4th (forbidden in CRASH), so no.
- “SNARL” – has L and N.
- “SNARE” – has E and N.
- “SPARK” – has K.
- “STARE” – has T and E.
- “SWARM” – has W and M, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 1st (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), no forbidden letters. This seems possible.

SWARM:
- S in 1st position (allowed, since S can be 1st, 2nd, or 5th, and 1st is not forbidden).
- W is allowed.
- A is 3rd ✓.
- R is 4th (allowed, since R can be 1st, 4th, or 5th, and 4th is not forbidden).

- W is allowed.
- A is 3rd ✓.
- R is 4th (allowed, since R can be 1st, 4th, or 5th, and 4th is not forbidden).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
2. It contains an S but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

I need a 5-letter word with A in the middle and an S somewhere after the first letter. I should also avoid L, T, and E.

Possible candidates:
- CHASM (but has an S in the 5th position - might be good)
- CRASH (but has an S in the 4th position, which might be good since S can't be 1st)
- BASIN (but has an S in the 4th position)
- DASH (but only 4 letters)
- GASP (but only 4 letters)

Looking at 5-letter words with _ _ A _ _ pattern and no L/T/E:
- CHASM: C H A S M - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- CRASH: C R A S H - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- VASAL (but has L-like structure)
- PANSY (but has S in 4th and Y may not be ideal)
- GASPY (but has S in 4th and Y)

CRASH seems good - uses common letters C, R, A, S, H, none of which are excluded.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E do not exist.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - C and H do not exist.

Known facts:
- Word must have A in position 3.
- Word must contain S (positions 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is taken by A, so 2 or 5).
- Word must contain R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, H, L, T, E.

Possible positions for S and R:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We also need to place R somewhere allowed.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words fitting these constraints:

1. _ S A _ _:
   - RSAB_ – but need valid word.
   - R S A _ _ – hard to form common word.
   - MS A _ _ – but M is allowed, N is allowed, etc.

2. _ _ A _ S:
   - This seems harder to form common words.
   - Need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and R in 4 (since R can’t be 2).

Possible candidate: “B R A N S” – but N is allowed, B and N not forbidden.
Check: B R A N S → A is 3rd ✓, S is 5th ✓, R is 2nd (but feedback said R is in word but wrong position in CRASH, where R was 2nd – so R cannot be 2nd). Thus BRANS fails because R is 2nd.

Next: “D R A N S” – R is 2nd again, fails.

Next: “G R A N S” – same issue.

Next: “F R A N S” – same.

Next: “P R A N S” – same.

Next: “B R A V S” – no.

Next: “B A R S” – too short.

Wait, we need 5 letters with A in 3rd, S somewhere, R somewhere, and no C/H/L/T/E.

Let’s try “BRAND” – but ends with D, not S.

Wait, we need S in 2nd or 5th, and R in 1st, 4th, or 5th, and A is fixed at 3rd.

Let’s list valid words:

- _ S A _ _:
  - “BSA…” – hard.
  - “MSA…” – no.
  - “NSA…” – no.
  - “PSA…” – no.
  - “RSA…” – no.
  - “WSA…” – no.

- _ _ A _ S:
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “D R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “F R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “G R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “P R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “B R A I N S” – too long.
  - “B R A V S” – no.
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd.

Hmm, seems hard. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A in 3rd, containing S and R, no C/H/L/T/E.

Using a word list filter:
- “BRAND” – no, ends with D.
- “BRAUN” – no, ends with N.
- “GRAINS” – too long.
- “FRANK” – ends with K.
- “GRASP” – has P, S, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 4th (forbidden in CRASH), so no.
- “SNARL” – has L and N.
- “SNARE” – has E and N.
- “SPARK” – has K.
- “STARE” – has T and E.
- “SWARM” – has W and M, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 1st (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), no forbidden letters. This seems possible.

SWARM:
- S in 1st position (allowed, since S can be 1st, 2nd, or 5th, and 1st is not forbidden).
- W is allowed.
- A is 3rd ✓.
- R is 4th (allowed, since R can be 1st, 4th, or 5th, and 4th is not forbidden).
- M is allowed.

No forbidden letters (C, H, L, T, E).

Thus, SWARM fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
2. It contains an S but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

I need a 5-letter word with A in the middle and an S somewhere after the first letter. I should also avoid L, T, and E.

Possible candidates:
- CHASM (but has an S in the 5th position - might be good)
- CRASH (but has an S in the 4th position, which might be good since S can't be 1st)
- BASIN (but has an S in the 4th position)
- DASH (but only 4 letters)
- GASP (but only 4 letters)

Looking at 5-letter words with _ _ A _ _ pattern and no L/T/E:
- CHASM: C H A S M - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- CRASH: C R A S H - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- VASAL (but has L-like structure)
- PANSY (but has S in 4th and Y may not be ideal)
- GASPY (but has S in 4th and Y)

CRASH seems good - uses common letters C, R, A, S, H, none of which are excluded.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E do not exist.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - C and H do not exist.

Known facts:
- Word must have A in position 3.
- Word must contain S (positions 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is taken by A, so 2 or 5).
- Word must contain R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, H, L, T, E.

Possible positions for S and R:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We also need to place R somewhere allowed.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words fitting these constraints:

1. _ S A _ _:
   - RSAB_ – but need valid word.
   - R S A _ _ – hard to form common word.
   - MS A _ _ – but M is allowed, N is allowed, etc.

2. _ _ A _ S:
   - This seems harder to form common words.
   - Need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and R in 4 (since R can’t be 2).

Possible candidate: “B R A N S” – but N is allowed, B and N not forbidden.
Check: B R A N S → A is 3rd ✓, S is 5th ✓, R is 2nd (but feedback said R is in word but wrong position in CRASH, where R was 2nd – so R cannot be 2nd). Thus BRANS fails because R is 2nd.

Next: “D R A N S” – R is 2nd again, fails.

Next: “G R A N S” – same issue.

Next: “F R A N S” – same.

Next: “P R A N S” – same.

Next: “B R A V S” – no.

Next: “B A R S” – too short.

Wait, we need 5 letters with A in 3rd, S somewhere, R somewhere, and no C/H/L/T/E.

Let’s try “BRAND” – but ends with D, not S.

Wait, we need S in 2nd or 5th, and R in 1st, 4th, or 5th, and A is fixed at 3rd.

Let’s list valid words:

- _ S A _ _:
  - “BSA…” – hard.
  - “MSA…” – no.
  - “NSA…” – no.
  - “PSA…” – no.
  - “RSA…” – no.
  - “WSA…” – no.

- _ _ A _ S:
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “D R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “F R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “G R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “P R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “B R A I N S” – too long.
  - “B R A V S” – no.
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd.

Hmm, seems hard. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A in 3rd, containing S and R, no C/H/L/T/E.

Using a word list filter:
- “BRAND” – no, ends with D.
- “BRAUN” – no, ends with N.
- “GRAINS” – too long.
- “FRANK” – ends with K.
- “GRASP” – has P, S, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 4th (forbidden in CRASH), so no.
- “SNARL” – has L and N.
- “SNARE” – has E and N.
- “SPARK” – has K.
- “STARE” – has T and E.
- “SWARM” – has W and M, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 1st (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), no forbidden letters. This seems possible.

SWARM:
- S in 1st position (allowed, since S can be 1st, 2nd, or 5th, and 1st is not forbidden).
- W is allowed.
- A is 3rd ✓.
- R is 4th (allowed, since R can be 1st, 4th, or 5th, and 4th is not forbidden).
- M is allowed.

No forbidden letters (C, H, L, T, E).

Thus, SWARM fits all constraints.

<guess>SWARM</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
Guess 3: SWARM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ _ A _ _
   - S exists, but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E do not exist.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Pattern: _ _ A _ _
   - R exists, but not in position 2.
   - S exists, but not in position 4.
   - C, H do not exist.

3. SWARM → S(-) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(x)
   - Pattern: _ _ A R _
   - S exists, but not in position 1.
   - W, M do not exist.
   - R is now fixed in position 4.

So we know:
- Exact pattern: _ _ A R _
- S exists somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 4 (since A is 3rd and R is 4th).
- Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters forbidden so far: C, H, L, M, T, W, E.
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (plus S in 2nd or 5th).

Case 1: S in position 2 → _ S A R _
   - Examples: BSAR_, DSAR_, FSAR_, etc. Need valid word.
   - ""BSARS"" – not a word.
   - ""DSARS"" – not a word.
   - ""FSARS"" – not a word.

Case 2: S in position 5 → _ _ A R S
   - Examples: B N A R S, D N A R S, F N A R S, G N A R S, P N A R S, etc.
   - ""BRANS"" – not a word.
   - ""DNARS"" – not a word.
   - ""FNARS"" – not a word.
   - ""GNARS"" – not a word.
   - ""PNARS"" – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words.

For _ _ A R S:
- ""FAROS"" – no, O is allowed but S is 5th ✓.
- ""BARDS"" – D is allowed, B is allowed, A is 3rd ✓, R is 4th ✓, S is 5th ✓.
  - Check letters: B, A, R, D, S – none are forbidden.
  - Check positions: A is 3rd ✓ (ok), R is 4th ✓ (ok), S is 5th ✓ (ok).
  - Also, B and D are allowed.

""BARDS"" fits perfectly.

For _ S A R S:
- ""BSARS"" – not a word.
- ""DSARS"" – not a word.
- ""FSARS"" – not a word.

Thus, the only valid candidate seems to be ""BARDS"".

Let me verify:
- B A R D S → A is 3rd ✓, R is 4th ✓, S is 5th ✓.
- Letters used: B, A, R, D, S – none are forbidden.
- S is in 5th position (allowed), R is in 4th (fixed), A is 3rd (fixed).

Therefore, ""BARDS"" is the logical next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Forbidden letters (x in any feedback): C, H, L, M, T, W, B, D  
Forbidden positions:
- A cannot be 1st (SLATE) or 2nd (BARDS) – so A must be 3rd.
- R cannot be 2nd (CRASH) or 4th (SWARM) – so R must be 1st or 5th.
- S cannot be 1st (SLATE) or 4th (CRASH) – so S must be 2nd or 5th.

Current pattern:
- 3rd letter = A
- 4th letter = R (or 5th, whichever is allowed)
- 2nd letter = S (or 5th, whichever is allowed)
- Remaining letters must come from {F, G, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z}

We need a 5-letter word with:

   “P R A N S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).  
   “G R A N S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).  
   “F R A N S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).

Case 3: R in 5th and S in 2nd → _ S A _ R

   “NSARS” – invalid.  
   “PSARS” – invalid.

Case 4: R in 5th and S in 5th → impossible (can’t have two S’s).

Case 5: R in 5th and S in 1st → S _ A _ R  
   Need 2nd and 4th letters.  
   Possible word: S P A R _ – needs 5th.  
   “SPAR_” – “SPARE” has E (forbidden).  
   “SPARS” – plural of spar, but 5-letter dictionary word is “SPARS” (rare).  
   Better: “SPRAY” – has Y (allowed).  
   Check letters: S, P, R, A, Y – none forbidden.  
   Check positions:  
   - A is 3rd ✓  
   - R is 4th (allowed 1st or 5th, here 4th)  
   - S is 1st (allowed 1st, 2nd, or 5th, here 1st)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
2. It contains an S but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

I need a 5-letter word with A in the middle and an S somewhere after the first letter. I should also avoid L, T, and E.

Possible candidates:
- CHASM (but has an S in the 5th position - might be good)
- CRASH (but has an S in the 4th position, which might be good since S can't be 1st)
- BASIN (but has an S in the 4th position)
- DASH (but only 4 letters)
- GASP (but only 4 letters)

Looking at 5-letter words with _ _ A _ _ pattern and no L/T/E:
- CHASM: C H A S M - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- CRASH: C R A S H - S in 4th position, no L/T/E
- VASAL (but has L-like structure)
- PANSY (but has S in 4th and Y may not be ideal)
- GASPY (but has S in 4th and Y)

CRASH seems good - uses common letters C, R, A, S, H, none of which are excluded.

<guess>CRASH</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E do not exist.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _
   - R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.
   - S exists somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - C and H do not exist.

Known facts:
- Word must have A in position 3.
- Word must contain S (positions 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is taken by A, so 2 or 5).
- Word must contain R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, H, L, T, E.

Possible positions for S and R:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We also need to place R somewhere allowed.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words fitting these constraints:

1. _ S A _ _:
   - RSAB_ – but need valid word.
   - R S A _ _ – hard to form common word.
   - MS A _ _ – but M is allowed, N is allowed, etc.

2. _ _ A _ S:
   - This seems harder to form common words.
   - Need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and R in 4 (since R can’t be 2).

Possible candidate: “B R A N S” – but N is allowed, B and N not forbidden.
Check: B R A N S → A is 3rd ✓, S is 5th ✓, R is 2nd (but feedback said R is in word but wrong position in CRASH, where R was 2nd – so R cannot be 2nd). Thus BRANS fails because R is 2nd.

Next: “D R A N S” – R is 2nd again, fails.

Next: “G R A N S” – same issue.

Next: “F R A N S” – same.

Next: “P R A N S” – same.

Next: “B R A V S” – no.

Next: “B A R S” – too short.

Wait, we need 5 letters with A in 3rd, S somewhere, R somewhere, and no C/H/L/T/E.

Let’s try “BRAND” – but ends with D, not S.

Wait, we need S in 2nd or 5th, and R in 1st, 4th, or 5th, and A is fixed at 3rd.

Let’s list valid words:

- _ S A _ _:
  - “BSA…” – hard.
  - “MSA…” – no.
  - “NSA…” – no.
  - “PSA…” – no.
  - “RSA…” – no.
  - “WSA…” – no.

- _ _ A _ S:
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “D R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “F R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “G R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “P R A N S” – R is 2nd, fails.
  - “B R A I N S” – too long.
  - “B R A V S” – no.
  - “B R A N S” – R is 2nd.

Hmm, seems hard. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A in 3rd, containing S and R, no C/H/L/T/E.

Using a word list filter:
- “BRAND” – no, ends with D.
- “BRAUN” – no, ends with N.
- “GRAINS” – too long.
- “FRANK” – ends with K.
- “GRASP” – has P, S, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 4th (forbidden in CRASH), so no.
- “SNARL” – has L and N.
- “SNARE” – has E and N.
- “SPARK” – has K.
- “STARE” – has T and E.
- “SWARM” – has W and M, but A is 3rd ✓, S is 1st (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), no forbidden letters. This seems possible.

SWARM:
- S in 1st position (allowed, since S can be 1st, 2nd, or 5th, and 1st is not forbidden).
- W is allowed.
- A is 3rd ✓.
- R is 4th (allowed, since R can be 1st, 4th, or 5th, and 4th is not forbidden).
- M is allowed.

No forbidden letters (C, H, L, T, E).

Thus, SWARM fits all constraints.

<guess>SWARM</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
Guess 3: SWARM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ _ A _ _
   - S exists, but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E do not exist.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Pattern: _ _ A _ _
   - R exists, but not in position 2.
   - S exists, but not in position 4.
   - C, H do not exist.

3. SWARM → S(-) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(x)
   - Pattern: _ _ A R _
   - S exists, but not in position 1.
   - W, M do not exist.
   - R is now fixed in position 4.

So we know:
- Exact pattern: _ _ A R _
- S exists somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 4 (since A is 3rd and R is 4th).
- Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters forbidden so far: C, H, L, M, T, W, E.
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (plus S in 2nd or 5th).

Case 1: S in position 2 → _ S A R _
   - Examples: BSAR_, DSAR_, FSAR_, etc. Need valid word.
   - ""BSARS"" – not a word.
   - ""DSARS"" – not a word.
   - ""FSARS"" – not a word.

Case 2: S in position 5 → _ _ A R S
   - Examples: B N A R S, D N A R S, F N A R S, G N A R S, P N A R S, etc.
   - ""BRANS"" – not a word.
   - ""DNARS"" – not a word.
   - ""FNARS"" – not a word.
   - ""GNARS"" – not a word.
   - ""PNARS"" – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words.

For _ _ A R S:
- ""FAROS"" – no, O is allowed but S is 5th ✓.
- ""BARDS"" – D is allowed, B is allowed, A is 3rd ✓, R is 4th ✓, S is 5th ✓.
  - Check letters: B, A, R, D, S – none are forbidden.
  - Check positions: A is 3rd ✓ (ok), R is 4th ✓ (ok), S is 5th ✓ (ok).
  - Also, B and D are allowed.

""BARDS"" fits perfectly.

For _ S A R S:
- ""BSARS"" – not a word.
- ""DSARS"" – not a word.
- ""FSARS"" – not a word.

Thus, the only valid candidate seems to be ""BARDS"".

Let me verify:
- B A R D S → A is 3rd ✓, R is 4th ✓, S is 5th ✓.
- Letters used: B, A, R, D, S – none are forbidden.
- S is in 5th position (allowed), R is in 4th (fixed), A is 3rd (fixed).

Therefore, ""BARDS"" is the logical next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
Guess 3: SWARM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(x)
Guess 4: BARDS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) R(-) D(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Forbidden letters (x in any feedback): C, H, L, M, T, W, B, D  
Forbidden positions:
- A cannot be 1st (SLATE) or 2nd (BARDS) – so A must be 3rd.
- R cannot be 2nd (CRASH) or 4th (SWARM) – so R must be 1st or 5th.
- S cannot be 1st (SLATE) or 4th (CRASH) – so S must be 2nd or 5th.

Current pattern:
- 3rd letter = A
- 4th letter = R (or 5th, whichever is allowed)
- 2nd letter = S (or 5th, whichever is allowed)
- Remaining letters must come from {F, G, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z}

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3
- R in position 1 or 5
- S in position 2 or 5
- No forbidden letters

Case 1: R in 1st and S in 2nd → R S A R _  
   Need a 5th letter not forbidden and not already used.  
   Possible word: R S A R F → “RARSF” – invalid.  
   “RARSN” – not a word.  
   Hard to form common word.

Case 2: R in 1st and S in 5th → R _ A _ S  
   Need 2nd and 4th letters from allowed set.  
   Possible word: R N A I S → “RN AIS” – invalid.  
   “R A I N S” – A is 2nd (forbidden).  
   “F R A I S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).  
   “P R A N S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).  
   “G R A N S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).  
   “F R A N S” – R is 2nd (forbidden).

Case 3: R in 5th and S in 2nd → _ S A _ R  
   Need 1st and 4th letters.  
   Possible word: F S A R _ – needs 5th letter.  
   “FSARR” – invalid.  
   “NSARS” – invalid.  
   “PSARS” – invalid.

Case 4: R in 5th and S in 5th → impossible (can’t have two S’s).

Case 5: R in 5th and S in 1st → S _ A _ R  
   Need 2nd and 4th letters.  
   Possible word: S P A R _ – needs 5th.  
   “SPAR_” – “SPARE” has E (forbidden).  
   “SPARS” – plural of spar, but 5-letter dictionary word is “SPARS” (rare).  
   Better: “SPRAY” – has Y (allowed).  
   Check letters: S, P, R, A, Y – none forbidden.  
   Check positions:  
   - A is 3rd ✓  
   - R is 4th (allowed 1st or 5th, here 4th)  
   - S is 1st (allowed 1st, 2nd, or 5th, here 1st)  
   - Y is allowed.  
   - No forbidden letters.

“SPRAY” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s update our working facts after the five guesses.

Forbidden letters (x in any feedback):
C, H, L, M, T, W, B, D, P, Y

Forbidden positions (from all feedbacks):
- A: cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 4th (because in SLATE it was 3rd, in CRASH 3rd, in SWARM 4th, in BARDS 2nd, in SPRAY 4th)  
  → A must be 3rd (original) or 5th (new).  
  But in CRASH, A was 3rd and in SWARM A was 3rd, so A is 3rd.  
  In BARDS A was 2nd (marked -), but that was a mistake – A was 3rd in SLATE, CRASH, SWARM.  
  In SPRAY A was 4th (marked -), but A is 3rd.  
  Therefore A is 3rd.

- R: cannot be 2nd (CRASH), 4th (SWARM), 2nd (SPRAY) – so R must be 1st or 5th.

- S: cannot be 1st (SLATE), 4th (CRASH), 1st (SWARM), 1st (SPRAY) – so S must be 2nd or 5th.

- Other letters: we can use F, G, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, X, Z (and S, A, R already placed).

Current pattern:
- 3rd letter = A
- 4th letter = R (or 5th, whichever is allowed)
- 2nd letter = S (or 5th, whichever is allowed)
- Remaining letters from {F, G, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, X, Z}

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in 3rd
- R in 1st or 5th
- S in 2nd or 5th
- No forbidden letters

Case 1: R in 1st and S in 2nd → R S A R _  
   Need 5th letter. Valid word? “R S A R _” – hard.

Case 2: R in 1st and S in 5th → R _ A _ S  
   Need 2nd and 4th letters.  
   Possible: R N A I S – invalid. “RN A I S” – no.

Case 3: R in 5th and S in 2nd → _ S A _ R  
   Need 1st and 4th letters.  
   Possible: F S A R _ – needs 5th. “FSARS” invalid.

Case 4: R in 5th and S in 5th → impossible (can’t have two S’s).

Case 5: R in 5th and S in 1st → S _ A _ R  
   Need 2nd and 4th letters.  
   Possible: S N A K R – “SNARK” – valid English word.

Check SNARK:
- S: 1st – allowed (only forbidden: 1st in SLATE, CRASH, SWARM, SPRAY)  
- N: allowed  
- A: 3rd ✓  
- R: 5th (allowed 1st or 5th)  
- K: allowed  

No forbidden letters. Perfect.

Therefore, the only remaining logical word is SNARK.
