For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in position 1.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRK"":
- S in position 2 (not position 1, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses common letters H, I, R, K that weren't ruled out.
- No L, A, T, E.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (it was “-” in all those places).  
  Therefore S must be in position 4 or 5.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was “-” when it appeared in position 4 of SOUND).
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was “-” when it appeared in position 5 of SOUND).

So the word looks like one of these two patterns:
- _ O _ S _
- _ O _ _ S

Remaining available letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: C, F, G, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (only O is confirmed and used, A, E, I, U are out)

We need to pick a word that fits one of the patterns above, uses only the allowed consonants, and introduces new consonants to narrow the search space.

Let’s try the first pattern: _ O _ S _
A good candidate is “FOGSY” but Y is uncommon and F, G, S, Y are allowed. However, “FOGSY” isn’t a common word and might be less likely.

A more common word fitting the pattern is “MOSSY” but again Y is questionable.

Another common word is “WOMPS” but P, W are allowed, and it fits _ O _ S _. However, “WOMPS” isn’t a standard word.

Looking for standard words:
- “WOMBS” – B is allowed, fits _ O _ S _. But B is allowed.
- “COMPS” – C, P, S allowed, fits _ O _ S _.
- “GONYS” – G, N, Y, S allowed, but N is already known not to be in position 4 (it was “-” in position 4 of SOUND), so N in position 3 is okay. But “GONYS” isn’t a common word.

The best common word I can see is “COMPS” which fits _ O _ S _ and uses new letters C and P.

But wait, in SOUND the N was in position 4 and was “-”, so N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. In “COMPS” N is in position 4 again, which would automatically be wrong. So “COMPS” is invalid because N would again be in position 4.

Therefore I must try _ O _ S _ with N and D somewhere else.

Let’s try “DONGS”:
- D in position 1 (new spot, not ruled out)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (allowed, since N was only ruled out of position 4)
- G in position 4 (new letter)
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of positions 1,2,3)

But is “DONGS” a valid word? No, it doesn’t seem to be.

Let’s try “DONGS” isn’t valid, but “DONG” is a valid word. Wait, “DONG” is 4 letters. Need 5.

Another valid word fitting _ O _ S _ with N and D: “DONUTS” – but T and U are out.

Next idea: “PONDS” – but P, O, N, D, S fit the pattern _ O _ S _ with N and D. But “PONDS” isn’t a common word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O _ S _:
- “FOGSY” – F, O, G, S, Y. But Y is uncommon.
- “MOSSY” – M, O, S, S, Y. Again Y is questionable.
- “WOMPS” – not standard.
- “GONYS” – not standard.
- “PONDS” – not standard.
- “BONGS” – B, O, N, G, S. This looks promising: B, O, N, G, S. All letters are allowed (B, O, N, G, S), and it fits _ O _ S _ with N in position 3 (allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed).

“BONGS” is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- B: new letter, allowed
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N was only ruled out of position 4)
- G: new letter, allowed
- S: in position 5 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of positions 1,2,3)

This seems perfect.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in position 1.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRK"":
- S in position 2 (not position 1, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses common letters H, I, R, K that weren't ruled out.
- No L, A, T, E.

<guess>SHIRK</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHIRK → S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Neither L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K is in the word at all.
2. The letter S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (since it was marked “-” in both places).
3. Therefore S must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
4. We need a new 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Uses none of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K).
   - Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):
Vowels: O, U
Consonants: C, D, G, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S is in position 3 (satisfying the “-” feedback from both guesses).
- Uses O, U, N, D — none of which have been eliminated.
- Common letters that will help narrow the search space quickly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in position 1.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRK"":
- S in position 2 (not position 1, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses common letters H, I, R, K that weren't ruled out.
- No L, A, T, E.

<guess>SHIRK</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHIRK → S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Neither L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K is in the word at all.
2. The letter S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (since it was marked “-” in both places).
3. Therefore S must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
4. We need a new 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Uses none of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K).
   - Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):
Vowels: O, U
Consonants: C, D, G, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S is in position 3 (satisfying the “-” feedback from both guesses).
- Uses O, U, N, D — none of which have been eliminated.
- Common letters that will help narrow the search space quickly.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)
Guess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (it was “-” in all those places).  
  Therefore S must be in position 4 or 5.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was “-” when it appeared in position 4 of SOUND).
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was “-” when it appeared in position 5 of SOUND).

So the word looks like one of these two patterns:
- _ O _ S _
- _ O _ _ S

Remaining available letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: C, F, G, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (only O is confirmed and used, A, E, I, U are out)

We need to pick a word that fits one of the patterns above, uses only the allowed consonants, and introduces new consonants to narrow the search space.

Let’s try the first pattern: _ O _ S _
A good candidate is “FOGSY” but Y is uncommon and F, G, S, Y are allowed. However, “FOGSY” isn’t a common word and might be less likely.

A more common word fitting the pattern is “MOSSY” but again Y is questionable.

Another common word is “WOMPS” but P, W are allowed, and it fits _ O _ S _. However, “WOMPS” isn’t a standard word.

Looking for standard words:
- “WOMBS” – B is allowed, fits _ O _ S _. But B is allowed.
- “COMPS” – C, P, S allowed, fits _ O _ S _.
- “GONYS” – G, N, Y, S allowed, but N is already known not to be in position 4 (it was “-” in position 4 of SOUND), so N in position 3 is okay. But “GONYS” isn’t a common word.

The best common word I can see is “COMPS” which fits _ O _ S _ and uses new letters C and P.

But wait, in SOUND the N was in position 4 and was “-”, so N can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. In “COMPS” N is in position 4 again, which would automatically be wrong. So “COMPS” is invalid because N would again be in position 4.

Therefore I must try _ O _ S _ with N and D somewhere else.

Let’s try “DONGS”:
- D in position 1 (new spot, not ruled out)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (allowed, since N was only ruled out of position 4)
- G in position 4 (new letter)
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of positions 1,2,3)

But is “DONGS” a valid word? No, it doesn’t seem to be.

Let’s try “DONGS” isn’t valid, but “DONG” is a valid word. Wait, “DONG” is 4 letters. Need 5.

Another valid word fitting _ O _ S _ with N and D: “DONUTS” – but T and U are out.

Next idea: “PONDS” – but P, O, N, D, S fit the pattern _ O _ S _ with N and D. But “PONDS” isn’t a common word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O _ S _:
- “FOGSY” – F, O, G, S, Y. But Y is uncommon.
- “MOSSY” – M, O, S, S, Y. Again Y is questionable.
- “WOMPS” – not standard.
- “GONYS” – not standard.
- “PONDS” – not standard.
- “BONGS” – B, O, N, G, S. This looks promising: B, O, N, G, S. All letters are allowed (B, O, N, G, S), and it fits _ O _ S _ with N in position 3 (allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed).

“BONGS” is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- B: new letter, allowed
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N was only ruled out of position 4)
- G: new letter, allowed
- S: in position 5 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of positions 1,2,3)

This seems perfect.

- G is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).

So the word pattern is: _ O N G S

Need 5.\n\nAnother valid word fitting _ O _ S _ with N and D: “DONUTS” – but T and U are out.\n\nNext idea: “PONDS” – but P, O, N, D, S fit the pattern _ O _ S _ with N and D. But “PONDS” isn’t a common word.\n\nWait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O _ S _:\n- “FOGSY” – F, O, G, S, Y. But Y is uncommon.\n- “MOSSY” – M, O, S, S, Y. Again Y is questionable.\n- “WOMPS” – not standard.\n- “GONYS” – not standard.\n- “PONDS” – not standard.\n- “BONGS” – B, O, N, G, S. This looks promising: B, O, N, G, S. All letters are allowed (B, O, N, G, S), and it fits _ O _ S _ with N in position 3 (allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed).\n\n“BONGS” is a valid word and fits all constraints.\n\nLet me verify:\n- B: new letter, allowed\n- O: in position 2 (✓)\n- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N was only ruled out of position 4)\n- G: new letter, allowed\n- S: in position 5 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of positions 1,2,3)\n\nThis seems perfect.\n\n<guess>BONGS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(-)\nGuess 4: BONGS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on BONGS we now know:\n\n- O is in position 2 (already confirmed).\n- N is in position 3 (✓).\n- G is in position 4 (✓).\n- S is in position 5 (✓).\n\nSo the word pattern is: _ O N G S\n\nThe only missing letter is the first one.  \nLetters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, B.\n\nRemaining first-letter candidates (common consonants): C, F, M, P, V, W, Y.\n\nValid 5-letter words that fit _ O N G S:\n- CONGS – C is allowed and not yet ruled out.\n- FONGS – not a standard word.\n- MONGS – not standard.\n- PONGS – not standard.\n- VONGS – not standard.\n- WONGS – not standard.\n- YONGS – not standard.\n\nThe only standard word left is CONGS.\n\nLet’s verify:\n- C: new letter, allowed.\n- O, N, G, S: already confirmed and fit exactly.\n\nTherefore the secret word must be CONGS.\n\n<guess>CONGS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(-)\nGuess 4: BONGS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 5: CONGS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the feedback on CONGS we just received:

- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2.
- N(✓) – N is in position 3.
- G(✓) – G is in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5.

So the word is exactly _ O N G S.

Letters already ruled out (from all feedback) include C, and no others have been placed in the first position yet.  
Remaining first-letter candidates (common consonants) that have not been eliminated: F, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking at standard English 5-letter words that end in “ONGS”, the only common one left is:

F O N G S  →  FONGS (though this isn’t a standard dictionary word)  
M O N G S  →  MONGS (not standard)  
P O N G S  →  PONGS (not standard)  
V O N G S  →  VONGS (not standard)  
W O N G S  →  WONGS (not standard)  
Y O N G S  →  YONGS (not standard)  

The only legitimate English word ending in “ONGS” is “ONG” itself, but that’s only 4 letters.  
Wait—actually the standard dictionary word list shows:

- FONGS – not valid
- MONGS – not valid
- PONGS – not valid
- VONGS – not valid
- WONGS – not valid
- YONGS – not valid

But there is a valid word: “ONG” + a letter, yet we need five letters.  
Rechecking the elimination list: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, B, C are out.  
The only remaining common consonant for the first position is “F”, “M”, “P”, “V”, “W”, or “Y”, but none form a standard 5-letter word ending in “ONGS”.

However, there is a real 5-letter word: “DONGS” – but D was already ruled out in SOUND (feedback D(-)).

Wait—let me list the exact dictionary words ending in “ONGS”:

- FONGS – not a standard word
- MONGS – not standard
- PONGS – not standard
- VONGS – not standard
- WONGS – not standard
- YONGS – not standard
- DONGS – D is out (from SOUND feedback)

Realizing now the only actual valid 5-letter word that ends with “ONGS” is **DONGS**, but D was marked “-” in position 1 of SOUND, meaning D is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore D could still be in position 1, but we didn’t know that.

Going back to the first time D appeared in SOUND (position 1), the feedback was D(-), meaning D is in the word but not in position 1.  
Therefore D could be in position 1, but we didn’t confirm it.

The word must be **DONGS**.

Let’s verify:
- D: allowed and not yet placed.
- O: position 2 (✓).
- N: position 3 (✓).
- G: position 4 (✓).
- S: position 5 (✓).

And D has not been ruled out yet.

Hence the secret word is DONGS.
