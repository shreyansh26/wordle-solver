### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere other than position 4
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letter pattern: _ A _ _ _
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5
- We should avoid R, I, E

Good consonants to try next include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we might want to try a vowel like O or U to test another position. However, A is already locked in position 2.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (testing if S must be here)
- A is in position 2 (matches what we know)
- T, N, D are common letters we haven't tested yet
- Avoids R, I, E

Another possibility is ""SALAD"" but that repeats A and we've seen no evidence of D yet. ""STOAT"" is also possible but uses T twice which isn't ideal. 

""STAND"" seems like the best balance of testing new letters and respecting the constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.

2. From STAND:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirms position 4 is wrong).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.
   - A is NOT in position 3 (but we already know it’s in position 2).

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _
S must appear in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2,4 are ruled out).
Letters to avoid: R, I, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3 or 5
- No R, I, E, T, N, D

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are out).

Let’s try a word like “BASIC”:
- B (new), A (correct spot), S (must be somewhere), I (invalid – I is out).
Invalidates “BASIC”.

Try “CASSO”:
- C, S (must be here), A, S (duplicate), O.
But S must be in 3 or 5, here it’s in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid (from RAISE feedback).

Try “GASSY”:
- G, A, S (3), S (4), Y.
S is in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “PASSE”:
- P, A, S (3), S (4), E (invalid).

Try “LASSO”:
- L, A, S (3), S (4), O.
Again S in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “MASON”:
- M, A, S (3), O, N (invalid).

Try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, O, P, S (5).
Check constraints:
- A is in 2 – yes.
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 1,2,3,4).
- No R, I, E, T, N, D – yes.

“CLOPS” fits all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another word could be “VASSA” but that’s not a valid English word.
“FASCI” – invalid.
“GASSY” – invalid (E, S in 4).
“PASSE” – invalid (E).
“LASSO” – invalid (O is okay but S in 4 is invalid).

Thus, “CLOPS” is the best candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

Good consonants to try next include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we might want to try a vowel like O or U to test another position. However, A is already locked in position 2.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (testing if S must be here)
- A is in position 2 (matches what we know)
- T, N, D are common letters we haven't tested yet
- Avoids R, I, E

Another possibility is ""SALAD"" but that repeats A and we've seen no evidence of D yet. ""STOAT"" is also possible but uses T twice which isn't ideal. 

""STAND"" seems like the best balance of testing new letters and respecting the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.

2. From STAND:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirms position 4 is wrong).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.
   - A is NOT in position 3 (but we already know it’s in position 2).

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _
S must appear in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2,4 are ruled out).
Letters to avoid: R, I, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3 or 5
- No R, I, E, T, N, D

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are out).

Let’s try a word like “BASIC”:
- B (new), A (correct spot), S (must be somewhere), I (invalid – I is out).
Invalidates “BASIC”.

Try “CASSO”:
- C, S (must be here), A, S (duplicate), O.
But S must be in 3 or 5, here it’s in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid (from RAISE feedback).

Try “GASSY”:
- G, A, S (3), S (4), Y.
S is in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “PASSE”:
- P, A, S (3), S (4), E (invalid).

Try “LASSO”:
- L, A, S (3), S (4), O.
Again S in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “MASON”:
- M, A, S (3), O, N (invalid).

Try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, O, P, S (5).
Check constraints:
- A is in 2 – yes.
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 1,2,3,4).
- No R, I, E, T, N, D – yes.

“CLOPS” fits all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another word could be “VASSA” but that’s not a valid English word.
“FASCI” – invalid.
“GASSY” – invalid (E, S in 4).
“PASSE” – invalid (E).
“LASSO” – invalid (O is okay but S in 4 is invalid).

Thus, “CLOPS” is the best candidate.

Let’s update our knowledge after the three guesses.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are out.
   - A is in position 2.

   - Therefore S must be in position 5.

2. From STAND:

   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (already known S must be in 5).

3. From CLOPS:

Possible candidates:
- BAGGS – invalid (G already unknown, but S is duplicate).
- CABAL – C is out.
- FAMUS – F, A, M, U, S – fits pattern and no forbidden letters.
- GAMUS – G, A, M, U, S – fits.
- HAKKS – invalid (K duplicate and not a word).
- MACHO – O is out.
- VAMPS – P is out.
- WASHY – Y, W, H – fits pattern.

“FAMUS” and “GAMUS” are both valid, but “WASHY” is a common word and uses W, H, Y – all still possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere other than position 4
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letter pattern: _ A _ _ _
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5
- We should avoid R, I, E

Good consonants to try next include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we might want to try a vowel like O or U to test another position. However, A is already locked in position 2.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (testing if S must be here)
- A is in position 2 (matches what we know)
- T, N, D are common letters we haven't tested yet
- Avoids R, I, E

Another possibility is ""SALAD"" but that repeats A and we've seen no evidence of D yet. ""STOAT"" is also possible but uses T twice which isn't ideal. 

""STAND"" seems like the best balance of testing new letters and respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.

2. From STAND:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirms position 4 is wrong).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.
   - A is NOT in position 3 (but we already know it’s in position 2).

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _
S must appear in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2,4 are ruled out).
Letters to avoid: R, I, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3 or 5
- No R, I, E, T, N, D

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are out).

Let’s try a word like “BASIC”:
- B (new), A (correct spot), S (must be somewhere), I (invalid – I is out).
Invalidates “BASIC”.

Try “CASSO”:
- C, S (must be here), A, S (duplicate), O.
But S must be in 3 or 5, here it’s in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid (from RAISE feedback).

Try “GASSY”:
- G, A, S (3), S (4), Y.
S is in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “PASSE”:
- P, A, S (3), S (4), E (invalid).

Try “LASSO”:
- L, A, S (3), S (4), O.
Again S in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “MASON”:
- M, A, S (3), O, N (invalid).

Try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, O, P, S (5).
Check constraints:
- A is in 2 – yes.
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 1,2,3,4).
- No R, I, E, T, N, D – yes.

“CLOPS” fits all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another word could be “VASSA” but that’s not a valid English word.
“FASCI” – invalid.
“GASSY” – invalid (E, S in 4).
“PASSE” – invalid (E).
“LASSO” – invalid (O is okay but S in 4 is invalid).

Thus, “CLOPS” is the best candidate.

Let’s update our knowledge after the three guesses.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are out.
   - A is in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (from STAND and CLOPS).
   - Therefore S must be in position 5.

2. From STAND:
   - T, N, D are out.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (already known S must be in 5).

3. From CLOPS:
   - C, L, O, P are out.

So far the pattern is: _ A _ _ S and the remaining letters we haven’t ruled out include: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits: _ A _ _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BAGGS – invalid (G already unknown, but S is duplicate).
- CABAL – C is out.
- FAMUS – F, A, M, U, S – fits pattern and no forbidden letters.
- GAMUS – G, A, M, U, S – fits.
- HAKKS – invalid (K duplicate and not a word).
- MACHO – O is out.
- VAMPS – P is out.
- WASHY – Y, W, H – fits pattern.

“FAMUS” and “GAMUS” are both valid, but “WASHY” is a common word and uses W, H, Y – all still possible.

Let’s pick “WASHY”.

Check constraints:
- W, A, S (must be in 5), H, Y.
- A is in position 2 – correct.
- S is in position 5 – correct (not 1,2,3,4).
- No R, I, E, T, N, D, C, L, O, P – correct.

Let’s update the constraints after four guesses.

Known facts:
1. A must be the second letter: _ A _ _ _
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (because in WASHY S was in position 3 and got “-”, meaning it’s not in 3 either).
   - Therefore S must be in position 5, but position 5 is already confirmed to be S by the “✓” in CLOPS (position 4) and the “-” in WASHY (position 3) – this is a bit ambiguous; let me re-express:
   - From CLOPS: S is in the word and is **not** in position 4 (✓).  
   - From WASHY: S is in the word and is **not** in position 3 (-).  
   - So S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
   - Position 2 is A, so S must be in position 1 or 5.

3. Letters definitely out: R, I, E, T, N, D, C, L, O, P, W, H, Y.

So the pattern is one of:
- S A _ _ _  (S in position 1)
- _ A _ _ S  (S in position 5)

Remaining usable letters (excluding the banned set): B, F, G, K, M, U, V, X, Z (and any others not yet ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting one of the patterns above.

Possible candidates:
- S A _ _ _ :  
  - SAKES – K, E, S – E is out.
  - SAMBS – B, M, S – fits, but B and M are allowed.
  - SAPPY – P, Y are out.
  - SABOT – T is out.
  - SALSA – L, A (duplicate), S – A is fixed in position 2, but duplicate A is okay; but S is in position 5 here, so pattern _ A _ _ S; SALSA has A in 2 and S in 5 – uses L (out), so no.
- _ A _ _ S :  
  - BAGGS – G is allowed, but double S; also G is allowed.
  - FAMUS – M, U, F are allowed; pattern _ A M _ S → F A M U S? No, that’s 5 letters only if F is first; FAMUS is F-A-M-U-S, which is 5 letters: F A M U S. But we need to check if F, M, U, S are allowed; they are. But is FAMUS a word? Yes, it’s a valid word meaning “must be mustered”.

Check constraints:
- F, A, M, U, S.
- A is in position 2 – correct.
- S is in position 5 – correct.
- No banned letters used.

Therefore, “FAMUS” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere other than position 4
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letter pattern: _ A _ _ _
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5
- We should avoid R, I, E

Good consonants to try next include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we might want to try a vowel like O or U to test another position. However, A is already locked in position 2.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (testing if S must be here)
- A is in position 2 (matches what we know)
- T, N, D are common letters we haven't tested yet
- Avoids R, I, E

Another possibility is ""SALAD"" but that repeats A and we've seen no evidence of D yet. ""STOAT"" is also possible but uses T twice which isn't ideal. 

""STAND"" seems like the best balance of testing new letters and respecting the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.

2. From STAND:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirms position 4 is wrong).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.
   - A is NOT in position 3 (but we already know it’s in position 2).

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _
S must appear in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2,4 are ruled out).
Letters to avoid: R, I, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3 or 5
- No R, I, E, T, N, D

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are out).

Let’s try a word like “BASIC”:
- B (new), A (correct spot), S (must be somewhere), I (invalid – I is out).
Invalidates “BASIC”.

Try “CASSO”:
- C, S (must be here), A, S (duplicate), O.
But S must be in 3 or 5, here it’s in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid (from RAISE feedback).

Try “GASSY”:
- G, A, S (3), S (4), Y.
S is in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “PASSE”:
- P, A, S (3), S (4), E (invalid).

Try “LASSO”:
- L, A, S (3), S (4), O.
Again S in 3 and 4 – 4 is invalid.

Try “MASON”:
- M, A, S (3), O, N (invalid).

Try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, O, P, S (5).
Check constraints:
- A is in 2 – yes.
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 1,2,3,4).
- No R, I, E, T, N, D – yes.

“CLOPS” fits all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another word could be “VASSA” but that’s not a valid English word.
“FASCI” – invalid.
“GASSY” – invalid (E, S in 4).
“PASSE” – invalid (E).
“LASSO” – invalid (O is okay but S in 4 is invalid).

Thus, “CLOPS” is the best candidate.

<guess>CLOPS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: CLOPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(x) P(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update our knowledge after the three guesses.

1. From RAISE:
   - R, I, E are out.
   - A is in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (from STAND and CLOPS).
   - Therefore S must be in position 5.

2. From STAND:
   - T, N, D are out.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (already known S must be in 5).

3. From CLOPS:
   - C, L, O, P are out.

So far the pattern is: _ A _ _ S and the remaining letters we haven’t ruled out include: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits: _ A _ _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BAGGS – invalid (G already unknown, but S is duplicate).
- CABAL – C is out.
- FAMUS – F, A, M, U, S – fits pattern and no forbidden letters.
- GAMUS – G, A, M, U, S – fits.
- HAKKS – invalid (K duplicate and not a word).
- MACHO – O is out.
- VAMPS – P is out.
- WASHY – Y, W, H – fits pattern.

“FAMUS” and “GAMUS” are both valid, but “WASHY” is a common word and uses W, H, Y – all still possible.

Let’s pick “WASHY”.

Check constraints:
- W, A, S (must be in 5), H, Y.
- A is in position 2 – correct.
- S is in position 5 – correct (not 1,2,3,4).
- No R, I, E, T, N, D, C, L, O, P – correct.

Therefore, “WASHY” is a valid next guess.

Guess 4: WASHY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update the constraints after four guesses.

Known facts:
1. A must be the second letter: _ A _ _ _
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (because in WASHY S was in position 3 and got “-”, meaning it’s not in 3 either).
   - Therefore S must be in position 5, but position 5 is already confirmed to be S by the “✓” in CLOPS (position 4) and the “-” in WASHY (position 3) – this is a bit ambiguous; let me re-express:
   - From CLOPS: S is in the word and is **not** in position 4 (✓).  
   - From WASHY: S is in the word and is **not** in position 3 (-).  
   - So S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
   - Position 2 is A, so S must be in position 1 or 5.

3. Letters definitely out: R, I, E, T, N, D, C, L, O, P, W, H, Y.

So the pattern is one of:
- S A _ _ _  (S in position 1)
- _ A _ _ S  (S in position 5)

Remaining usable letters (excluding the banned set): B, F, G, K, M, U, V, X, Z (and any others not yet ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting one of the patterns above.

Possible candidates:
- S A _ _ _ :  
  - SAKES – K, E, S – E is out.
  - SAMBS – B, M, S – fits, but B and M are allowed.
  - SAPPY – P, Y are out.
  - SABOT – T is out.
  - SALSA – L, A (duplicate), S – A is fixed in position 2, but duplicate A is okay; but S is in position 5 here, so pattern _ A _ _ S; SALSA has A in 2 and S in 5 – uses L (out), so no.
- _ A _ _ S :  
  - BAGGS – G is allowed, but double S; also G is allowed.
  - FAMUS – M, U, F are allowed; pattern _ A M _ S → F A M U S? No, that’s 5 letters only if F is first; FAMUS is F-A-M-U-S, which is 5 letters: F A M U S. But we need to check if F, M, U, S are allowed; they are. But is FAMUS a word? Yes, it’s a valid word meaning “must be mustered”.

Check constraints:

Therefore, “FAMUS” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate all constraints after five guesses.

1. Position 2 is A: _ A _ _ _
2. S must be in the word and is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (feedback from WASHY and FAMUS shows S in position 5 got “✓”, but that would imply S is in position 5, yet in CLOPS S was “-” at position 4 and in WASHY S was “-” at position 3, and in FAMUS S got “✓” at position 5).  
   This is a bit ambiguous; let me re-express:

   - From CLOPS: S is in the word and NOT in position 4 (✓).
   - From WASHY: S is in the word and NOT in position 3 (-).
   - From FAMUS: S is in the word and NOT in position 5 (-) because the feedback was “S(✓)” but that would mean S is in position 5, which conflicts with WASHY’s feedback that S is not in position 3 (and we already knew S isn’t in 4 from CLOPS).

   Wait, the feedback must be interpreted per-guess using the guess positions:

   - CLOPS: S at position 4 → S not in 4
   - WASHY: S at position 3 → S not in 3
   - FAMUS: S at position 5 → S not in 5 (so S must be in position 1 or 2)

   But position 2 is A (✓), so S must be in position 1.

   Therefore the pattern is: S A _ _ _

3. Letters definitely out:
   R, I, E, T, N, D, C, L, O, P, W, H, Y, F, M, U

4. Remaining letters: B, G, K, V, X, Z (and others not yet guessed).

We need a 5-letter English word of the form S A _ _ _ using only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
   - S A K _ S → “SAKES” – E is out.
   - S A B _ S → “SABES” – E is out.
   - S A G _ S → “SAGGS” – valid, but G is allowed.
   - S A K _ S → “SAKES” – E out.
   - S A B _ S → “SABES” – E out.
   - S A K _ S → “SAKES” – E out.
   - S A G _ S → “SAGGS” – valid.

   “SAGGS” uses S, A, G, G, S – but we don’t know if G is allowed yet (it hasn’t been ruled out). However, we have no evidence against G.

   Another possibility: “SAPPY” – but P and Y are out.

   “SAVGS” – not a word.

   “SAGGY” – Y is out.

   “SAPPY” – invalid.

   “SACKS” – K is allowed, but C is out.

   “SAGGS” seems the only valid word left that fits S A _ _ S and uses allowed letters.

   Let me verify:
   - S A G G S
   - Letters used: S, A, G, G, S
   - A is in position 2 – correct
   - S is in positions 1 and 5 – positions 1 and 5 are allowed for S (only positions 3 and 4 were disallowed)
   - No banned letters (R,I,E,T,N,D,C,L,O,P,W,H,Y,F,M,U) are used.

   Therefore, “SAGGS” is a valid guess.
