### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (confirmed twice).
2. It contains an S, but S is NOT in position 3 or 4 (from AROSE and ALOUD).
3. It does NOT contain R, O, U, D, L, or E.
4. Remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 must be filled using letters not yet eliminated.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for S are 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is taken by A and 4 is ruled out).

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only allowed letters (none of R, O, U, D, L, E)

Possible candidates:
- ASH (S in 2, but only 4 letters)
- ASSIST (too long)
- AMISS (S in 3, but has S again which might be allowed, but we already know S is in the word)
- AGIST (S in 3, but has T and I which are okay)
- ASKS (S in 2, but 4 letters)
- ABASE (has E which is out)
- ACORN (has O & R which are out)
- ANGST (has G & T & S in 3)
- ANGST fits: A N G S T
  - Starts with A ✓
  - S is in position 4 – but feedback from AROSE says S is NOT in position 4 (because in AROSE S was in position 4 and got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not there). So ANGST is invalid because S would be in position 4.

Next try:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S appears twice, but we don’t know if S is double. Also M, I are new letters.
- AGIST (A G I S T) – S in position 4 again, invalid.
- ANGST (invalid position of S)
- ACUTE (has E which is out)
- ABYSS (S in 2 and 5, but S in 4 is invalid, and E is out, but Y is allowed)

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in positions 2 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses B, Y which are new and allowed.

Another candidate:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S in 3 and 5, but we don’t know if S is double.

Between ABYSS and AMISS, ABYSS seems safer as it only uses one S.

But let’s check:
- ABYSS: A(✓) B(_) Y(_) S(-) S(-)
  - A is correct position.
  - S appears in positions 2 and 5. The feedback from AROSE said S is in the word but not in position 4, and from ALOUD S was in position 3 (also “-”), so S can be in 2, 5. ABYSS covers both.

However, we might want to avoid double letters initially to maximize info. Another option:

- ABASE (invalid, has E)
- ACORN (invalid, has O, R)
- AGIST (invalid, has S in 4)
- ANGST (invalid, S in 4)
- AMISS (valid, S in 3 and 5)

AMISS:
- A M I S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in 3 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses M, I, which are new and allowed.

This seems better as it tests two new letters (M, I) and two possible positions for S.

So my next guess is AMISS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in the 4th position
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or E

I want a word that starts with A, includes S (but not in position 4), and avoids R, O, E. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, etc. A possible structure could be A _ S _ _ or A _ _ S _. 

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with A that fit:
- ASH (but only 4 letters)
- ALOUD (but has O and U, and S is in position 3 which is allowed)
- AVAST (but has E which is out)
- AMISS (has S in position 4 which is invalid)
- AGIST (has S in position 4 which is invalid)

ALOUD seems to fit:
- Starts with A
- Has S in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses L and D which are new letters to test
- Doesn't use R, O, or E

<guess>ALOUD</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (confirmed twice).
2. It contains an S, but S is NOT in position 3 or 4 (from AROSE and ALOUD).
3. It does NOT contain R, O, U, D, L, or E.
4. Remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 must be filled using letters not yet eliminated.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for S are 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is taken by A and 4 is ruled out).

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only allowed letters (none of R, O, U, D, L, E)

Possible candidates:
- ASH (S in 2, but only 4 letters)
- ASSIST (too long)
- AMISS (S in 3, but has S again which might be allowed, but we already know S is in the word)
- AGIST (S in 3, but has T and I which are okay)
- ASKS (S in 2, but 4 letters)
- ABASE (has E which is out)
- ACORN (has O & R which are out)
- ANGST (has G & T & S in 3)
- ANGST fits: A N G S T
  - Starts with A ✓
  - S is in position 4 – but feedback from AROSE says S is NOT in position 4 (because in AROSE S was in position 4 and got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not there). So ANGST is invalid because S would be in position 4.

Next try:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S appears twice, but we don’t know if S is double. Also M, I are new letters.
- AGIST (A G I S T) – S in position 4 again, invalid.
- ANGST (invalid position of S)
- ACUTE (has E which is out)
- ABYSS (S in 2 and 5, but S in 4 is invalid, and E is out, but Y is allowed)

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in positions 2 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses B, Y which are new and allowed.

Another candidate:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S in 3 and 5, but we don’t know if S is double.

Between ABYSS and AMISS, ABYSS seems safer as it only uses one S.

But let’s check:
- ABYSS: A(✓) B(_) Y(_) S(-) S(-)
  - A is correct position.
  - S appears in positions 2 and 5. The feedback from AROSE said S is in the word but not in position 4, and from ALOUD S was in position 3 (also “-”), so S can be in 2, 5. ABYSS covers both.

However, we might want to avoid double letters initially to maximize info. Another option:

- ABASE (invalid, has E)
- ACORN (invalid, has O, R)
- AGIST (invalid, has S in 4)
- ANGST (invalid, S in 4)
- AMISS (valid, S in 3 and 5)

AMISS:
- A M I S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in 3 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses M, I, which are new and allowed.

This seems better as it tests two new letters (M, I) and two possible positions for S.

So my next guess is AMISS.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. The word definitely starts with A (confirmed in all three guesses).
2. It contains S:
   - From AROSE: S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - From ALOUD: S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - From AMISS: S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (again) and S is in position 5 with ✓, so the final S is correct in position 5.
   - Therefore the word ends in ...AS.

3. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, O, U, D, L, E, I (from AMISS feedback: I is out).

4. Letters still allowed (not yet used or ruled out):
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. The second letter A, third letter must be from the allowed set, and so on.

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ AS
with the middle three letters coming from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} and must include S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4.

But we already have S in position 5, so positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled with three distinct letters from the allowed set, none of which are any of the excluded letters.

Possible words fitting A _ _ _ AS:
- A B A S (but A is already in position 1, and we don’t know if A repeats)
- A C A S (possible)
- A F A S (possible)
- A G A S (possible)
- A H A S (possible)
- A N A S (possible)
- A C H A S (but H is allowed, A is allowed)
- A N G A S (but G is allowed, A is allowed)
- A B B A S (but B is allowed, A is allowed)

Among these, the simplest 5-letter word that fits is “ANGAS” (though this is a proper noun). A more common word is “ANGEL” but L is ruled out. “ANGST” is 5 letters, fits the pattern A N G S T, but T is allowed.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with A and ending with AS, without using any excluded letters:

Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible middle letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try:
- A B A S (but A is already in position 1, and we don’t know if A repeats)
- A C A S (possible)
- A F A S (possible)
- A G A S (possible)
- A H A S (possible)
- A N A S (possible)
- A C H A S (but this is 5 letters: A C H A S)
  - A C H A S: uses C, H, A. All allowed.
  - Check if any letters in ACHAS are excluded: no R, O, U, D, L, E, I – all good.

“ACHAS” is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of “a char” or “a chas” in some dialects). It fits the pattern A _ _ _ AS with letters A, C, H, A, S.

But let’s double-check another common word: “ANTAS” (antique spelling of “antass” – not common). “ACORN” has O/R – out. “ABASE” has E – out. “AGAST” has S in 4 – out. “ABYSS” has Y and S, but S is already in 5, and Y is allowed.

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in position 5 ✓
- Uses B and Y which are new and allowed.

This seems more common. Let’s go with ABYSS.

But wait, let’s confirm the letters in ABYSS:
- A: allowed and correct position
- B: new letter, allowed
- Y: new letter, allowed
- S: allowed and correct position 5
- S: allowed and correct position 5 (it could repeat)

ABYSS is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in the 4th position
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or E

I want a word that starts with A, includes S (but not in position 4), and avoids R, O, E. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, etc. A possible structure could be A _ S _ _ or A _ _ S _. 

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with A that fit:
- ASH (but only 4 letters)
- ALOUD (but has O and U, and S is in position 3 which is allowed)
- AVAST (but has E which is out)
- AMISS (has S in position 4 which is invalid)
- AGIST (has S in position 4 which is invalid)

ALOUD seems to fit:
- Starts with A
- Has S in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses L and D which are new letters to test
- Doesn't use R, O, or E

<guess>ALOUD</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (confirmed twice).
2. It contains an S, but S is NOT in position 3 or 4 (from AROSE and ALOUD).
3. It does NOT contain R, O, U, D, L, or E.
4. Remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 must be filled using letters not yet eliminated.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for S are 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is taken by A and 4 is ruled out).

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only allowed letters (none of R, O, U, D, L, E)

Possible candidates:
- ASH (S in 2, but only 4 letters)
- ASSIST (too long)
- AMISS (S in 3, but has S again which might be allowed, but we already know S is in the word)
- AGIST (S in 3, but has T and I which are okay)
- ASKS (S in 2, but 4 letters)
- ABASE (has E which is out)
- ACORN (has O & R which are out)
- ANGST (has G & T & S in 3)
- ANGST fits: A N G S T
  - Starts with A ✓
  - S is in position 4 – but feedback from AROSE says S is NOT in position 4 (because in AROSE S was in position 4 and got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not there). So ANGST is invalid because S would be in position 4.

Next try:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S appears twice, but we don’t know if S is double. Also M, I are new letters.
- AGIST (A G I S T) – S in position 4 again, invalid.
- ANGST (invalid position of S)
- ACUTE (has E which is out)
- ABYSS (S in 2 and 5, but S in 4 is invalid, and E is out, but Y is allowed)

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in positions 2 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses B, Y which are new and allowed.

Another candidate:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S in 3 and 5, but we don’t know if S is double.

Between ABYSS and AMISS, ABYSS seems safer as it only uses one S.

But let’s check:
- ABYSS: A(✓) B(_) Y(_) S(-) S(-)
  - A is correct position.
  - S appears in positions 2 and 5. The feedback from AROSE said S is in the word but not in position 4, and from ALOUD S was in position 3 (also “-”), so S can be in 2, 5. ABYSS covers both.

However, we might want to avoid double letters initially to maximize info. Another option:

- ABASE (invalid, has E)
- ACORN (invalid, has O, R)
- AGIST (invalid, has S in 4)
- ANGST (invalid, S in 4)
- AMISS (valid, S in 3 and 5)

AMISS:
- A M I S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in 3 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses M, I, which are new and allowed.

This seems better as it tests two new letters (M, I) and two possible positions for S.

So my next guess is AMISS.

<guess>AMISS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: AMISS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(-) I(x) S(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. The word definitely starts with A (confirmed in all three guesses).
2. It contains S:
   - From AROSE: S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - From ALOUD: S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - From AMISS: S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (again) and S is in position 5 with ✓, so the final S is correct in position 5.
   - Therefore the word ends in ...AS.

3. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, O, U, D, L, E, I (from AMISS feedback: I is out).

4. Letters still allowed (not yet used or ruled out):
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. The second letter A, third letter must be from the allowed set, and so on.

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ AS
with the middle three letters coming from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} and must include S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4.

But we already have S in position 5, so positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled with three distinct letters from the allowed set, none of which are any of the excluded letters.

Possible words fitting A _ _ _ AS:
- A B A S (but A is already in position 1, and we don’t know if A repeats)
- A C A S (possible)
- A F A S (possible)
- A G A S (possible)
- A H A S (possible)
- A N A S (possible)
- A C H A S (but H is allowed, A is allowed)
- A N G A S (but G is allowed, A is allowed)
- A B B A S (but B is allowed, A is allowed)

Among these, the simplest 5-letter word that fits is “ANGAS” (though this is a proper noun). A more common word is “ANGEL” but L is ruled out. “ANGST” is 5 letters, fits the pattern A N G S T, but T is allowed.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with A and ending with AS, without using any excluded letters:

Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible middle letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try:
- A B A S (but A is already in position 1, and we don’t know if A repeats)
- A C A S (possible)
- A F A S (possible)
- A G A S (possible)
- A H A S (possible)
- A N A S (possible)
- A C H A S (but this is 5 letters: A C H A S)
  - A C H A S: uses C, H, A. All allowed.
  - Check if any letters in ACHAS are excluded: no R, O, U, D, L, E, I – all good.

“ACHAS” is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of “a char” or “a chas” in some dialects). It fits the pattern A _ _ _ AS with letters A, C, H, A, S.

But let’s double-check another common word: “ANTAS” (antique spelling of “antass” – not common). “ACORN” has O/R – out. “ABASE” has E – out. “AGAST” has S in 4 – out. “ABYSS” has Y and S, but S is already in 5, and Y is allowed.

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in position 5 ✓
- Uses B and Y which are new and allowed.

This seems more common. Let’s go with ABYSS.

But wait, let’s confirm the letters in ABYSS:
- A: allowed and correct position
- B: new letter, allowed
- Y: new letter, allowed
- S: allowed and correct position 5
- S: allowed and correct position 5 (it could repeat)

ABYSS is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Current knowledge:

1. Word is A _ _ _ AS (A at 1, S at 5).
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y.
3. From AMISS and ABYSS we learned S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (AMISS: S not in 4; ABYSS: S not in 4) – but we already know S is in position 5, so this reinforces only.  
   The feedback “S(-)” in both AMISS and ABYSS means S is in the word but NOT in the position guessed (position 4 in AMISS, position 4 in ABYSS). Since we already have S in position 5 confirmed, this is consistent and gives no new info.

4. We still need the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters from the remaining allowed set:  
   C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

5. We must avoid any letter that has already been ruled out.

6. A common 5-letter word matching A _ _ _ AS with remaining letters is “ACHAS” (as noted) or “ANTAS” (antique spelling).  
   Another everyday word is “ANSAS” (a river in the United States) – but it has an S in position 3 which we have ruled out for S (from AMISS: S not in 4, and ABYSS: S not in 4) – wait, no: AMISS had S in 4 and got “-”, ABYSS had S in 4 and got “-”.  
   So S is NOT in position 4, but we already know S is in position 5.  
   Therefore the word is A _ _ _ AS, and the letters in positions 2,3,4 must be chosen from the still-allowed set.

7. Checking valid English words:
   - A C H A S – not a common dictionary word.
   - A C N A S – not valid.
   - A F A S – too short.
   - A G A S T – no.
   - A N G A S – not valid.
   - A C H A S – no.
   - A N T A S – no.
   - A C H A S – no.
   - A N G A S – no.

   But “ANGAS” is a valid word (a type of steel).

   - A: allowed and already in position 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in the 4th position
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or E

I want a word that starts with A, includes S (but not in position 4), and avoids R, O, E. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, etc. A possible structure could be A _ S _ _ or A _ _ S _. 

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with A that fit:
- ASH (but only 4 letters)
- ALOUD (but has O and U, and S is in position 3 which is allowed)
- AVAST (but has E which is out)
- AMISS (has S in position 4 which is invalid)
- AGIST (has S in position 4 which is invalid)

ALOUD seems to fit:
- Starts with A
- Has S in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses L and D which are new letters to test
- Doesn't use R, O, or E

<guess>ALOUD</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (confirmed twice).
2. It contains an S, but S is NOT in position 3 or 4 (from AROSE and ALOUD).
3. It does NOT contain R, O, U, D, L, or E.
4. Remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 must be filled using letters not yet eliminated.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for S are 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is taken by A and 4 is ruled out).

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only allowed letters (none of R, O, U, D, L, E)

Possible candidates:
- ASH (S in 2, but only 4 letters)
- ASSIST (too long)
- AMISS (S in 3, but has S again which might be allowed, but we already know S is in the word)
- AGIST (S in 3, but has T and I which are okay)
- ASKS (S in 2, but 4 letters)
- ABASE (has E which is out)
- ACORN (has O & R which are out)
- ANGST (has G & T & S in 3)
- ANGST fits: A N G S T
  - Starts with A ✓
  - S is in position 4 – but feedback from AROSE says S is NOT in position 4 (because in AROSE S was in position 4 and got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not there). So ANGST is invalid because S would be in position 4.

Next try:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S appears twice, but we don’t know if S is double. Also M, I are new letters.
- AGIST (A G I S T) – S in position 4 again, invalid.
- ANGST (invalid position of S)
- ACUTE (has E which is out)
- ABYSS (S in 2 and 5, but S in 4 is invalid, and E is out, but Y is allowed)

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in positions 2 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses B, Y which are new and allowed.

Another candidate:
- AMISS (A M I S S) – S in 3 and 5, but we don’t know if S is double.

Between ABYSS and AMISS, ABYSS seems safer as it only uses one S.

But let’s check:
- ABYSS: A(✓) B(_) Y(_) S(-) S(-)
  - A is correct position.
  - S appears in positions 2 and 5. The feedback from AROSE said S is in the word but not in position 4, and from ALOUD S was in position 3 (also “-”), so S can be in 2, 5. ABYSS covers both.

However, we might want to avoid double letters initially to maximize info. Another option:

- ABASE (invalid, has E)
- ACORN (invalid, has O, R)
- AGIST (invalid, has S in 4)
- ANGST (invalid, S in 4)
- AMISS (valid, S in 3 and 5)

AMISS:
- A M I S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in 3 and 5: one of them must be correct.
- Uses M, I, which are new and allowed.

This seems better as it tests two new letters (M, I) and two possible positions for S.

So my next guess is AMISS.

<guess>AMISS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: AMISS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(-) I(x) S(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. The word definitely starts with A (confirmed in all three guesses).
2. It contains S:
   - From AROSE: S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - From ALOUD: S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - From AMISS: S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (again) and S is in position 5 with ✓, so the final S is correct in position 5.
   - Therefore the word ends in ...AS.

3. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, O, U, D, L, E, I (from AMISS feedback: I is out).

4. Letters still allowed (not yet used or ruled out):
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. The second letter A, third letter must be from the allowed set, and so on.

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ AS
with the middle three letters coming from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} and must include S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4.

But we already have S in position 5, so positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled with three distinct letters from the allowed set, none of which are any of the excluded letters.

Possible words fitting A _ _ _ AS:
- A B A S (but A is already in position 1, and we don’t know if A repeats)
- A C A S (possible)
- A F A S (possible)
- A G A S (possible)
- A H A S (possible)
- A N A S (possible)
- A C H A S (but H is allowed, A is allowed)
- A N G A S (but G is allowed, A is allowed)
- A B B A S (but B is allowed, A is allowed)

Among these, the simplest 5-letter word that fits is “ANGAS” (though this is a proper noun). A more common word is “ANGEL” but L is ruled out. “ANGST” is 5 letters, fits the pattern A N G S T, but T is allowed.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with A and ending with AS, without using any excluded letters:

Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible middle letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try:
- A B A S (but A is already in position 1, and we don’t know if A repeats)
- A C A S (possible)
- A F A S (possible)
- A G A S (possible)
- A H A S (possible)
- A N A S (possible)
- A C H A S (but this is 5 letters: A C H A S)
  - A C H A S: uses C, H, A. All allowed.
  - Check if any letters in ACHAS are excluded: no R, O, U, D, L, E, I – all good.

“ACHAS” is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of “a char” or “a chas” in some dialects). It fits the pattern A _ _ _ AS with letters A, C, H, A, S.

But let’s double-check another common word: “ANTAS” (antique spelling of “antass” – not common). “ACORN” has O/R – out. “ABASE” has E – out. “AGAST” has S in 4 – out. “ABYSS” has Y and S, but S is already in 5, and Y is allowed.

ABYSS:
- A B Y S S
- Starts with A ✓
- S in position 5 ✓
- Uses B and Y which are new and allowed.

This seems more common. Let’s go with ABYSS.

But wait, let’s confirm the letters in ABYSS:
- A: allowed and correct position
- B: new letter, allowed
- Y: new letter, allowed
- S: allowed and correct position 5
- S: allowed and correct position 5 (it could repeat)

ABYSS is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

<guess>ABYSS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: AMISS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(-) I(x) S(-) S(✓)
Guess 4: ABYSS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) Y(x) S(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current knowledge:

1. Word is A _ _ _ AS (A at 1, S at 5).
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y.
3. From AMISS and ABYSS we learned S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (AMISS: S not in 4; ABYSS: S not in 4) – but we already know S is in position 5, so this reinforces only.  
   The feedback “S(-)” in both AMISS and ABYSS means S is in the word but NOT in the position guessed (position 4 in AMISS, position 4 in ABYSS). Since we already have S in position 5 confirmed, this is consistent and gives no new info.

4. We still need the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters from the remaining allowed set:  
   C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

5. We must avoid any letter that has already been ruled out.

6. A common 5-letter word matching A _ _ _ AS with remaining letters is “ACHAS” (as noted) or “ANTAS” (antique spelling).  
   Another everyday word is “ANSAS” (a river in the United States) – but it has an S in position 3 which we have ruled out for S (from AMISS: S not in 4, and ABYSS: S not in 4) – wait, no: AMISS had S in 4 and got “-”, ABYSS had S in 4 and got “-”.  
   So S is NOT in position 4, but we already know S is in position 5.  
   Therefore the word is A _ _ _ AS, and the letters in positions 2,3,4 must be chosen from the still-allowed set.

7. Checking valid English words:
   - A C H A S – not a common dictionary word.
   - A C N A S – not valid.
   - A F A S – too short.
   - A G A S T – no.
   - A N G A S – not valid.
   - A C H A S – no.
   - A N T A S – no.
   - A C H A S – no.
   - A N G A S – no.

   But “ANGAS” is a valid word (a type of steel).  
   Letters in ANGAS: A, N, G, A, S.  
   - A: allowed and already in position 1.  
   - N, G: not yet ruled out.  
   - Second A: allowed (no info against it).  
   - S: allowed and already in position 5.

   Let’s confirm no excluded letters are used:  
   R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y are all absent.  
   Good.

   Therefore, the next logical guess is ANGAS.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Word pattern: A _ _ _ AS  
   (A fixed in position 1, S fixed in position 5)

2. Letters already ruled out:  
   R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y, N

3. From Guess 5 (ANGAS):  
   - N is not in the word (x)  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  
   - Second A is in position 4 (✓)  
   - S is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the word is A _ _ A S, and the letters in positions 2 and 3 must be chosen from the still-allowed set:  
C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z, plus G (which we know is in the word but not in position 3).

G must appear in position 2 or 3, but it cannot be in position 3 (feedback said it’s not in position 3).  
Therefore G must be in position 2.

That fixes position 2 as G, giving:  
A G _ A S

Now position 3 must be filled with one of the remaining allowed letters (cannot be G, A, S, and cannot be any already-excluded letter).

Valid 5-letter words matching A G _ A S:
- AGAST (archaic spelling of “aghast”)
- AGUES (has E, excluded)
- AGUES (invalid)
- AGGAS (invalid)
- AGMAS (invalid)
- AGSAS (invalid)
- AGYAS (invalid)

The only common dictionary word left is AGAST, even though it’s archaic.  
But “agast” is not in standard Scrabble dictionaries.  
Let me double-check the remaining letters.

Wait – the allowed letters are: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z, and G (which we’ve placed as position 2).

Possible 5-letter words of the form A G _ A S:

- AG CAS (too short)
- AGGAS (invalid)
- AGMAS (invalid)
- AGSAS (invalid)
- AGYAS (invalid)

None of these are valid.  
I must have made a mistake.

Re-examine the feedback:

Guess 5: A N G A S  
Feedback: A(✓) N(x) G(-) A(✓) S(✓)

This tells us:
- A is in position 4 (✓) – already known.  
- G is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- Second A is in position 4 (✓).

So the pattern is A G _ A S, and position 3 must be filled with a letter that is:
- Not any of the excluded letters (R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y, N)  
- Not G (already placed)  
- Not A or S (already fixed)

Allowed letters for position 3: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Valid 5-letter words A G _ A S:
- AGCAS (too short)  
- AGGAS (invalid)  
- AGMAS (invalid)  
- AGSAS (invalid)  
- AGYAS (invalid)

None of these are valid.  
This suggests an inconsistency, but looking back: the only valid word fitting all constraints is “AGAST” (archaic), yet standard dictionaries accept “AGAST” as a variant spelling.  

However, if we strictly adhere to standard Scrabble dictionaries, the only valid word left is “AGAST” (which is obsolete).  
But we must provide a valid guess.  

Another candidate: “AGUES” – but E is excluded.  

Realization: the only possible valid word left is “AGAST”, but it’s archaic.  
Perhaps I missed another pattern.  

Recheck the feedback carefully:

From Guess 5: A N G A S  
Feedback: A(✓) N(x) G(-) A(✓) S(✓)

This implies:
- A is in position 4 (✓) – already known.  
- G is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- Second A is in position 4 (✓).

So the word is A G _ A S, and position 3 must be filled with a letter from the allowed set: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

The only valid English word fitting this exact pattern is “AGAST” (archaic).  
But standard Wordle dictionaries accept “AGAST” as a valid guess.

Therefore, the next guess is AGAST.

However, if we want a more common word, the only remaining possibility is “AGUES” but E is excluded.  
This suggests the only possible word left is “AGAST”.

But let me double-check another angle: the feedback said G is in the word but not in position 3.  
So G must be in position 2, and position 3 must be filled with another allowed letter.

Valid 5-letter words A G _ A S:

- AGCAS (too short)
- AGGAS (invalid)
- AGMAS (invalid)
- AGSAS (invalid)
- AGYAS (invalid)

None of these are valid.  
This implies the only possible valid word is “AGAST”.

Thus, the next guess is AGAST.

<guess>AGAST</guess>",AGAST,"Current confirmed facts:

1. Word pattern: A _ _ _ AS  
   (A fixed in position 1, S fixed in position 5)

2. Letters already ruled out:  
   R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y, N

3. From Guess 5 (ANGAS):  
   - N is not in the word (x)  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  
   - Second A is in position 4 (✓)  
   - S is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the word is A _ _ A S, and the letters in positions 2 and 3 must be chosen from the still-allowed set:  
C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z, plus G (which we know is in the word but not in position 3).

G must appear in position 2 or 3, but it cannot be in position 3 (feedback said it’s not in position 3).  
Therefore G must be in position 2.

That fixes position 2 as G, giving:  
A G _ A S

Now position 3 must be filled with one of the remaining allowed letters (cannot be G, A, S, and cannot be any already-excluded letter).

Valid 5-letter words matching A G _ A S:
- AGAST (archaic spelling of “aghast”)
- AGUES (has E, excluded)
- AGUES (invalid)
- AGGAS (invalid)
- AGMAS (invalid)
- AGSAS (invalid)
- AGYAS (invalid)

The only common dictionary word left is AGAST, even though it’s archaic.  
But “agast” is not in standard Scrabble dictionaries.  
Let me double-check the remaining letters.

Wait – the allowed letters are: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z, and G (which we’ve placed as position 2).

Possible 5-letter words of the form A G _ A S:

- AG CAS (too short)
- AGGAS (invalid)
- AGMAS (invalid)
- AGSAS (invalid)
- AGYAS (invalid)

None of these are valid.  
I must have made a mistake.

Re-examine the feedback:

Guess 5: A N G A S  
Feedback: A(✓) N(x) G(-) A(✓) S(✓)

This tells us:
- A is in position 4 (✓) – already known.  
- G is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- Second A is in position 4 (✓).

So the pattern is A G _ A S, and position 3 must be filled with a letter that is:
- Not any of the excluded letters (R, O, U, D, L, E, I, B, Y, N)  
- Not G (already placed)  
- Not A or S (already fixed)

Allowed letters for position 3: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Valid 5-letter words A G _ A S:
- AGCAS (too short)  
- AGGAS (invalid)
