### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. However, I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. Another good option is ""CRANE"". After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives me a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible candidates:
- TRICK (but has C and K, which are decent)
- TROOP (but has O twice, which might waste info)
- TRAIN (but has A, which is excluded)
- TIGER (but has E, which is excluded)
- CHORD (but has D and R, but no T in 1st position)
- BRUIT (but has U and I, but T is in 3rd position)

I'll choose ""TRICK"" because:
- It includes T in 1st position (not 4th, so valid for feedback)
- It uses common letters R, I, C, K
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (S, L, A, E)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. However, I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. Another good option is ""CRANE"". After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives me a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible candidates:
- TRICK (but has C and K, which are decent)
- TROOP (but has O twice, which might waste info)
- TRAIN (but has A, which is excluded)
- TIGER (but has E, which is excluded)
- CHORD (but has D and R, but no T in 1st position)
- BRUIT (but has U and I, but T is in 3rd position)

I'll choose ""TRICK"" because:
- It includes T in 1st position (not 4th, so valid for feedback)
- It uses common letters R, I, C, K
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (S, L, A, E)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. TRICK → T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)
   - T is in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with T.
   - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So R is in positions 2,3,4, or 5.
   - I, C, K are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- First letter is T.
- Second letter is NOT R (since R is in the word but not in position 2).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, I, C, K.
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R (which must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5).

Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).
Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R.

We need a word that:
- Starts with T.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, I, C, K.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- T _ _ R _ (e.g., TOWER, but O and W are allowed)
- T _ R _ _ (e.g., TRAIN, but A is excluded)
- T _ _ _ R (e.g., TUBER, but U and B are allowed)

Let's brainstorm:
- TUBER: T(✓), U(b), B(er), E(x) – but E is excluded.
- TOWER: T(✓), O(w), W(er), E(x) – E is excluded.
- TIGER – I is excluded.
- TUNER – U(n), N(er), E(x) – E is excluded.
- TOWER – E is excluded.
- TUBER – E is excluded.
- TURBO – O and U are allowed, but B and O are allowed. But is TURBO a valid word? Yes.
- TURBO: T(✓), U(r), B(o), O(w) – but O is used twice, which might not help much.
- TUNDR – not a valid word.
- TURNO – not a valid word.
- TURBO seems the best so far.

Another option: TUNER – but E is excluded.
TUNER invalid (E excluded).
TUNIC – I is excluded.
TUNNY – Y is allowed, but double N is possible. TUNNY is valid.

But TUNNY has N and Y, which are allowed.
TURBO has U, B, O – all allowed.

I'll go with TURBO as it uses U, B, O which are all allowed and fits the constraints.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be the fifth letter, since it showed ✓ in position 5)

Additional constraints:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from TRICK and TURBO feedback).
- Therefore R must be in position 4.

So the word structure is:
T _ _ R O

We need two middle letters from the remaining pool:
Allowed letters so far: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  (plus R, T, O which are already placed)

We want common letters to maximize info. The most common remaining consonants are N, D, M, F, G, H, P, V.

Possible candidates:
- T N _ R O → could be T N D R O (but ""TNDRO"" isn't a word)
- T F _ R O → T F N R O (not a word)
- T H _ R O → T H N R O (not a word)
- T M _ R O → T M N R O (not a word)
- T D _ R O → T D N R O (not a word)
- T G _ R O → T G N R O (not a word)
- T P _ R O → T P N R O (not a word)
- T V _ R O → T V N R O (not a word)
- T W _ R O → T W N R O (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. Maybe I'm missing some. Let me think differently.

Actually, the structure is T _ _ R O. The third letter must be R, but R is already placed at position 4. So the third letter can be anything from the remaining pool.

Let me list valid English words fitting T _ _ R O:
- TOWER – but E is excluded (from SLATE feedback)
- TUBRO – not a valid word
- TURRO – not a valid word
- TONRO – not a valid word
- TAVOR – A is excluded
- TIGOR – I and G, but I is excluded
- TONOR – second O is already at position 5, but this would have O in position 3
- TONOR is valid (meaning a person who makes music)
- TONER – E is excluded
- TONOR seems the only valid one.

Wait, let me check:
TONOR:
T(✓) O(✓) N(o) O(r) R(✓) – but O is already confirmed at position 5, and the feedback shows O at position 5 is correct. The word might have O in position 3 as well, but that's allowed (words can have repeated letters).

But is TONOR valid? Yes, it's a recognized word.

Another possibility: TUNOR – but ""tunor"" isn't a standard word.
TAVOR – A is excluded.
TIGOR – I is excluded.
TOKOR – not valid.
TOMOR – not valid.

TONOR seems the only valid candidate.

Let me verify:
- T O N O R: but this would have O in positions 2 and 3, which is allowed (no info against it).
- T O N R O – no, that's not right (R is at 4, O at 5).

Wait, the structure is T _ _ R O. So the third letter is R, but R is already at position 4. This is tricky.

Let me re-express the constraints:
- T is at position 1 (fixed)
- O is at position 5 (fixed)
- R must be in the word, but cannot be at position 4 (from TRICK and TURBO feedback). So R must be at position 3.
- Therefore the word must be T _ R R O – but that's invalid (R would be duplicated and position 4 would have R, but R is already at 4 and can't be duplicated? Actually the feedback didn't prohibit duplicates, so possible.)
- Wait, no: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates. So we can assume no duplicates.

Thus the word must be T _ R O, with R at position 3.

Valid words:
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TOKOR – K excluded
- TUNOR – not valid
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – valid (as in music)

No other obvious valid words. TONOR seems the only candidate.

But wait, let me think of others:
- T D R O – no
- T F R O – no
- T G R O – no
- T H R O – no
- T M R O – no
- T N R O – no
- T P R O – no
- T V R O – no
- T W R O – no

Actually, none of these are valid. This suggests I might have missed a possibility.

Alternative approach: maybe R is at position 3 and we have no evidence against it. The word could be T _ R O.

Valid words:
- TONOR (as noted)
- TROOP – but P is allowed, O is already confirmed at 5, but this would have O in position 2 and 4, which is allowed (no info against it)
- TROOP is valid (meaning a person who trots)

But TROOP has O in position 2 and 4, which is possible.

Between TONOR and TROOP, both fit. But TONOR is more commonly recognized.

I'll choose TONOR.

But wait, let me check if TONOR violates any constraints:
- T O N O R: positions are T(1) O(2) N(3) O(4) R(5)
- O is at 2 and 4 – no feedback against it.
- R is at 5 – but position 4 in TURBO had R at 3, and feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not at 3. So R could be at 5.
- So TONOR is valid.

Thus the guess is TONOR.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. However, I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. Another good option is ""CRANE"". After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives me a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible candidates:
- TRICK (but has C and K, which are decent)
- TROOP (but has O twice, which might waste info)
- TRAIN (but has A, which is excluded)
- TIGER (but has E, which is excluded)
- CHORD (but has D and R, but no T in 1st position)
- BRUIT (but has U and I, but T is in 3rd position)

I'll choose ""TRICK"" because:
- It includes T in 1st position (not 4th, so valid for feedback)
- It uses common letters R, I, C, K
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (S, L, A, E)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. TRICK → T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)
   - T is in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with T.
   - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So R is in positions 2,3,4, or 5.
   - I, C, K are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- First letter is T.
- Second letter is NOT R (since R is in the word but not in position 2).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, I, C, K.
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R (which must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5).

Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).
Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R.

We need a word that:
- Starts with T.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, I, C, K.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- T _ _ R _ (e.g., TOWER, but O and W are allowed)
- T _ R _ _ (e.g., TRAIN, but A is excluded)
- T _ _ _ R (e.g., TUBER, but U and B are allowed)

Let's brainstorm:
- TUBER: T(✓), U(b), B(er), E(x) – but E is excluded.
- TOWER: T(✓), O(w), W(er), E(x) – E is excluded.
- TIGER – I is excluded.
- TUNER – U(n), N(er), E(x) – E is excluded.
- TOWER – E is excluded.
- TUBER – E is excluded.
- TURBO – O and U are allowed, but B and O are allowed. But is TURBO a valid word? Yes.
- TURBO: T(✓), U(r), B(o), O(w) – but O is used twice, which might not help much.
- TUNDR – not a valid word.
- TURNO – not a valid word.
- TURBO seems the best so far.

Another option: TUNER – but E is excluded.
TUNER invalid (E excluded).
TUNIC – I is excluded.
TUNNY – Y is allowed, but double N is possible. TUNNY is valid.

But TUNNY has N and Y, which are allowed.
TURBO has U, B, O – all allowed.

I'll go with TURBO as it uses U, B, O which are all allowed and fits the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: TURBO -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be the fifth letter, since it showed ✓ in position 5)

Additional constraints:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from TRICK and TURBO feedback).
- Therefore R must be in position 4.

So the word structure is:
T _ _ R O

We need two middle letters from the remaining pool:
Allowed letters so far: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  (plus R, T, O which are already placed)

We want common letters to maximize info. The most common remaining consonants are N, D, M, F, G, H, P, V.

Possible candidates:
- T N _ R O → could be T N D R O (but ""TNDRO"" isn't a word)
- T F _ R O → T F N R O (not a word)
- T H _ R O → T H N R O (not a word)
- T M _ R O → T M N R O (not a word)
- T D _ R O → T D N R O (not a word)
- T G _ R O → T G N R O (not a word)
- T P _ R O → T P N R O (not a word)
- T V _ R O → T V N R O (not a word)
- T W _ R O → T W N R O (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. Maybe I'm missing some. Let me think differently.

Actually, the structure is T _ _ R O. The third letter must be R, but R is already placed at position 4. So the third letter can be anything from the remaining pool.

Let me list valid English words fitting T _ _ R O:
- TOWER – but E is excluded (from SLATE feedback)
- TUBRO – not a valid word
- TURRO – not a valid word
- TONRO – not a valid word
- TAVOR – A is excluded
- TIGOR – I and G, but I is excluded
- TONOR – second O is already at position 5, but this would have O in position 3
- TONOR is valid (meaning a person who makes music)
- TONER – E is excluded
- TONOR seems the only valid one.

Wait, let me check:
TONOR:
T(✓) O(✓) N(o) O(r) R(✓) – but O is already confirmed at position 5, and the feedback shows O at position 5 is correct. The word might have O in position 3 as well, but that's allowed (words can have repeated letters).

But is TONOR valid? Yes, it's a recognized word.

Another possibility: TUNOR – but ""tunor"" isn't a standard word.
TAVOR – A is excluded.
TIGOR – I is excluded.
TOKOR – not valid.
TOMOR – not valid.

TONOR seems the only valid candidate.

Let me verify:
- T O N O R: but this would have O in positions 2 and 3, which is allowed (no info against it).
- T O N R O – no, that's not right (R is at 4, O at 5).

Wait, the structure is T _ _ R O. So the third letter is R, but R is already at position 4. This is tricky.

Let me re-express the constraints:
- T is at position 1 (fixed)
- O is at position 5 (fixed)
- R must be in the word, but cannot be at position 4 (from TRICK and TURBO feedback). So R must be at position 3.
- Therefore the word must be T _ R R O – but that's invalid (R would be duplicated and position 4 would have R, but R is already at 4 and can't be duplicated? Actually the feedback didn't prohibit duplicates, so possible.)
- Wait, no: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates. So we can assume no duplicates.

Thus the word must be T _ R O, with R at position 3.

Valid words:
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TOKOR – K excluded
- TUNOR – not valid
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – valid (as in music)

No other obvious valid words. TONOR seems the only candidate.

But wait, let me think of others:
- T D R O – no
- T F R O – no
- T G R O – no
- T H R O – no
- T M R O – no
- T N R O – no
- T P R O – no
- T V R O – no
- T W R O – no

Actually, none of these are valid. This suggests I might have missed a possibility.

Alternative approach: maybe R is at position 3 and we have no evidence against it. The word could be T _ R O.

Valid words:
- TONOR (as noted)
- TROOP – but P is allowed, O is already confirmed at 5, but this would have O in position 2 and 4, which is allowed (no info against it)
- TROOP is valid (meaning a person who trots)

But TROOP has O in position 2 and 4, which is possible.

Between TONOR and TROOP, both fit. But TONOR is more commonly recognized.

I'll choose TONOR.

But wait, let me check if TONOR violates any constraints:
- T O N O R: positions are T(1) O(2) N(3) O(4) R(5)
- O is at 2 and 4 – no feedback against it.
- R is at 5 – but position 4 in TURBO had R at 3, and feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not at 3. So R could be at 5.
- So TONOR is valid.

Thus the guess is TONOR.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B, N

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be present, but feedback changed from ✓ to - in TONOR, so O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4)
R (must be in the word, but feedback changed from - to - in TURBO and TONOR, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5)

Additional constraints:
- T is fixed at position 1
- O must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from TONOR feedback)
- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from TURBO and TONOR feedback)
- Therefore R must be in position 4, and O must be in position 3 or 5
- But position 5 is already O (from O(✓) in TURBO), so O must be in position 3
- Thus the word structure is T _ O R O, but this would have O in positions 3 and 5, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
- However, the feedback for TONOR showed O(-) at position 2 and 4, meaning O is in the word but not at those positions. Given TURBO had O(✓) at position 5, this suggests O is at position 5
- But TURBO had O(✓) at position 5, so O is indeed at position 5
- Therefore the word must be T _ _ R O, with O at position 5
- R must be at position 4 (since it cannot be at 3 or 5)
- So the word is T _ _ R O
- O is at position 5 (confirmed by TURBO)
- From TONOR, O was - at position 2 and 4, meaning O is not at positions 2 or 4
- Thus the word must be T _ O R O (since O must be at 3 and 5)
- But T is at 1, O at 3 and 5: T _ O R O
- The third letter (position 3) must be O
- The fourth letter (position 4) must be R
- The fifth letter (position 5) must be O
- So the word is T _ O R O

Now we just need a valid English word fitting T _ O R O.
Possible letters for position 2: From remaining allowed letters (D, F, G, H, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z), common ones are D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W

Valid words:
- T D O R O – not valid
- T F O R O – not valid
- T G O R O – not valid
- T H O R O – not valid
- T M O R O – not valid
- T P O R O – not valid
- T V O R O – not valid
- T W O R O – not valid
- T Y O R O – not valid

None of these are valid. This suggests I might have made an error in deducing positions.

Wait, let me re-express the constraints carefully:

From TURBO:
- T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)
  - T is at 1
  - O is at 5
  - R is in word but not at 3

From TONOR:
- T(✓) O(-) N(x) O(-) R(-)
  - T is at 1 (consistent)
  - O is in word but not at 2 or 4
  - R is in word but not at 5
  - N is excluded

So R must be at position 4 (since it cannot be at 3 or 5)
O must be at position 3 (since it cannot be at 2 or 4, and 1 is T)

Thus the word must be T _ O R O

Valid words fitting T _ O R O:
- TOWER – E excluded
- TUBRO – invalid
- TURRO – invalid
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – already guessed
- TROOP – valid (meaning a person who trots)

Given that TROOP is the only valid word fitting T _ O R O, and all letters are allowed (T, R, O, P), this must be the word.

<guess>TROOP</guess>",TROOP,"Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B, N

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be present, but feedback changed from ✓ to - in TONOR, so O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4)
R (must be in the word, but feedback changed from - to - in TURBO and TONOR, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5)

Additional constraints:
- T is fixed at position 1
- O must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from TONOR feedback)
- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from TURBO and TONOR feedback)
- Therefore R must be in position 4, and O must be in position 3 or 5
- But position 5 is already O (from O(✓) in TURBO), so O must be in position 3
- Thus the word structure is T _ O R O, but this would have O in positions 3 and 5, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
- However, the feedback for TONOR showed O(-) at position 2 and 4, meaning O is in the word but not at those positions. Given TURBO had O(✓) at position 5, this suggests O is at position 5
- But TURBO had O(✓) at position 5, so O is indeed at position 5
- Therefore the word must be T _ _ R O, with O at position 5
- R must be at position 4 (since it cannot be at 3 or 5)
- So the word is T _ _ R O
- O is at position 5 (confirmed by TURBO)
- From TONOR, O was - at position 2 and 4, meaning O is not at positions 2 or 4
- Thus the word must be T _ O R O (since O must be at 3 and 5)
- But T is at 1, O at 3 and 5: T _ O R O
- The third letter (position 3) must be O
- The fourth letter (position 4) must be R
- The fifth letter (position 5) must be O
- So the word is T _ O R O

Now we just need a valid English word fitting T _ O R O.
Possible letters for position 2: From remaining allowed letters (D, F, G, H, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z), common ones are D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W

Valid words:
- T D O R O – not valid
- T F O R O – not valid
- T G O R O – not valid
- T H O R O – not valid
- T M O R O – not valid
- T P O R O – not valid
- T V O R O – not valid
- T W O R O – not valid
- T Y O R O – not valid

None of these are valid. This suggests I might have made an error in deducing positions.

Wait, let me re-express the constraints carefully:

From TURBO:
- T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)
  - T is at 1
  - O is at 5
  - R is in word but not at 3

From TONOR:
- T(✓) O(-) N(x) O(-) R(-)
  - T is at 1 (consistent)
  - O is in word but not at 2 or 4
  - R is in word but not at 5
  - N is excluded

So R must be at position 4 (since it cannot be at 3 or 5)
O must be at position 3 (since it cannot be at 2 or 4, and 1 is T)

Thus the word must be T _ O R O

Valid words fitting T _ O R O:
- TOWER – E excluded
- TUBRO – invalid
- TURRO – invalid
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – already guessed
- TROOP – valid (meaning a person who trots)

Given that TROOP is the only valid word fitting T _ O R O, and all letters are allowed (T, R, O, P), this must be the word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. However, I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. Another good option is ""CRANE"". After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives me a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible candidates:
- TRICK (but has C and K, which are decent)
- TROOP (but has O twice, which might waste info)
- TRAIN (but has A, which is excluded)
- TIGER (but has E, which is excluded)
- CHORD (but has D and R, but no T in 1st position)
- BRUIT (but has U and I, but T is in 3rd position)

I'll choose ""TRICK"" because:
- It includes T in 1st position (not 4th, so valid for feedback)
- It uses common letters R, I, C, K
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (S, L, A, E)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. TRICK → T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)
   - T is in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with T.
   - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So R is in positions 2,3,4, or 5.
   - I, C, K are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- First letter is T.
- Second letter is NOT R (since R is in the word but not in position 2).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, I, C, K.
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R (which must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5).

Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).
Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R.

We need a word that:
- Starts with T.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, I, C, K.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- T _ _ R _ (e.g., TOWER, but O and W are allowed)
- T _ R _ _ (e.g., TRAIN, but A is excluded)
- T _ _ _ R (e.g., TUBER, but U and B are allowed)

Let's brainstorm:
- TUBER: T(✓), U(b), B(er), E(x) – but E is excluded.
- TOWER: T(✓), O(w), W(er), E(x) – E is excluded.
- TIGER – I is excluded.
- TUNER – U(n), N(er), E(x) – E is excluded.
- TOWER – E is excluded.
- TUBER – E is excluded.
- TURBO – O and U are allowed, but B and O are allowed. But is TURBO a valid word? Yes.
- TURBO: T(✓), U(r), B(o), O(w) – but O is used twice, which might not help much.
- TUNDR – not a valid word.
- TURNO – not a valid word.
- TURBO seems the best so far.

Another option: TUNER – but E is excluded.
TUNER invalid (E excluded).
TUNIC – I is excluded.
TUNNY – Y is allowed, but double N is possible. TUNNY is valid.

But TUNNY has N and Y, which are allowed.
TURBO has U, B, O – all allowed.

I'll go with TURBO as it uses U, B, O which are all allowed and fits the constraints.

<guess>TURBO</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: TURBO -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be the fifth letter, since it showed ✓ in position 5)

Additional constraints:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from TRICK and TURBO feedback).
- Therefore R must be in position 4.

So the word structure is:
T _ _ R O

We need two middle letters from the remaining pool:
Allowed letters so far: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  (plus R, T, O which are already placed)

We want common letters to maximize info. The most common remaining consonants are N, D, M, F, G, H, P, V.

Possible candidates:
- T N _ R O → could be T N D R O (but ""TNDRO"" isn't a word)
- T F _ R O → T F N R O (not a word)
- T H _ R O → T H N R O (not a word)
- T M _ R O → T M N R O (not a word)
- T D _ R O → T D N R O (not a word)
- T G _ R O → T G N R O (not a word)
- T P _ R O → T P N R O (not a word)
- T V _ R O → T V N R O (not a word)
- T W _ R O → T W N R O (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. Maybe I'm missing some. Let me think differently.

Actually, the structure is T _ _ R O. The third letter must be R, but R is already placed at position 4. So the third letter can be anything from the remaining pool.

Let me list valid English words fitting T _ _ R O:
- TOWER – but E is excluded (from SLATE feedback)
- TUBRO – not a valid word
- TURRO – not a valid word
- TONRO – not a valid word
- TAVOR – A is excluded
- TIGOR – I and G, but I is excluded
- TONOR – second O is already at position 5, but this would have O in position 3
- TONOR is valid (meaning a person who makes music)
- TONER – E is excluded
- TONOR seems the only valid one.

Wait, let me check:
TONOR:
T(✓) O(✓) N(o) O(r) R(✓) – but O is already confirmed at position 5, and the feedback shows O at position 5 is correct. The word might have O in position 3 as well, but that's allowed (words can have repeated letters).

But is TONOR valid? Yes, it's a recognized word.

Another possibility: TUNOR – but ""tunor"" isn't a standard word.
TAVOR – A is excluded.
TIGOR – I is excluded.
TOKOR – not valid.
TOMOR – not valid.

TONOR seems the only valid candidate.

Let me verify:
- T O N O R: but this would have O in positions 2 and 3, which is allowed (no info against it).
- T O N R O – no, that's not right (R is at 4, O at 5).

Wait, the structure is T _ _ R O. So the third letter is R, but R is already at position 4. This is tricky.

Let me re-express the constraints:
- T is at position 1 (fixed)
- O is at position 5 (fixed)
- R must be in the word, but cannot be at position 4 (from TRICK and TURBO feedback). So R must be at position 3.
- Therefore the word must be T _ R R O – but that's invalid (R would be duplicated and position 4 would have R, but R is already at 4 and can't be duplicated? Actually the feedback didn't prohibit duplicates, so possible.)
- Wait, no: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates. So we can assume no duplicates.

Thus the word must be T _ R O, with R at position 3.

Valid words:
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TOKOR – K excluded
- TUNOR – not valid
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – valid (as in music)

No other obvious valid words. TONOR seems the only candidate.

But wait, let me think of others:
- T D R O – no
- T F R O – no
- T G R O – no
- T H R O – no
- T M R O – no
- T N R O – no
- T P R O – no
- T V R O – no
- T W R O – no

Actually, none of these are valid. This suggests I might have missed a possibility.

Alternative approach: maybe R is at position 3 and we have no evidence against it. The word could be T _ R O.

Valid words:
- TONOR (as noted)
- TROOP – but P is allowed, O is already confirmed at 5, but this would have O in position 2 and 4, which is allowed (no info against it)
- TROOP is valid (meaning a person who trots)

But TROOP has O in position 2 and 4, which is possible.

Between TONOR and TROOP, both fit. But TONOR is more commonly recognized.

I'll choose TONOR.

But wait, let me check if TONOR violates any constraints:
- T O N O R: positions are T(1) O(2) N(3) O(4) R(5)
- O is at 2 and 4 – no feedback against it.
- R is at 5 – but position 4 in TURBO had R at 3, and feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not at 3. So R could be at 5.
- So TONOR is valid.

Thus the guess is TONOR.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: TURBO -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)
Guess 4: TONOR -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(-) N(x) O(-) R(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B, N

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be present, but feedback changed from ✓ to - in TONOR, so O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4)
R (must be in the word, but feedback changed from - to - in TURBO and TONOR, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5)

Additional constraints:
- T is fixed at position 1
- O must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from TONOR feedback)
- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from TURBO and TONOR feedback)
- Therefore R must be in position 4, and O must be in position 3 or 5
- But position 5 is already O (from O(✓) in TURBO), so O must be in position 3
- Thus the word structure is T _ O R O, but this would have O in positions 3 and 5, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
- However, the feedback for TONOR showed O(-) at position 2 and 4, meaning O is in the word but not at those positions. Given TURBO had O(✓) at position 5, this suggests O is at position 5
- But TURBO had O(✓) at position 5, so O is indeed at position 5
- Therefore the word must be T _ _ R O, with O at position 5
- R must be at position 4 (since it cannot be at 3 or 5)
- So the word is T _ _ R O
- O is at position 5 (confirmed by TURBO)
- From TONOR, O was - at position 2 and 4, meaning O is not at positions 2 or 4
- Thus the word must be T _ O R O (since O must be at 3 and 5)
- But T is at 1, O at 3 and 5: T _ O R O
- The third letter (position 3) must be O
- The fourth letter (position 4) must be R
- The fifth letter (position 5) must be O
- So the word is T _ O R O

Now we just need a valid English word fitting T _ O R O.
Possible letters for position 2: From remaining allowed letters (D, F, G, H, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z), common ones are D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W

Valid words:
- T D O R O – not valid
- T F O R O – not valid
- T G O R O – not valid
- T H O R O – not valid
- T M O R O – not valid
- T P O R O – not valid
- T V O R O – not valid
- T W O R O – not valid
- T Y O R O – not valid

None of these are valid. This suggests I might have made an error in deducing positions.

Wait, let me re-express the constraints carefully:

From TURBO:
- T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)
  - T is at 1
  - O is at 5
  - R is in word but not at 3

From TONOR:
- T(✓) O(-) N(x) O(-) R(-)
  - T is at 1 (consistent)
  - O is in word but not at 2 or 4
  - R is in word but not at 5
  - N is excluded

So R must be at position 4 (since it cannot be at 3 or 5)
O must be at position 3 (since it cannot be at 2 or 4, and 1 is T)

Thus the word must be T _ O R O

Valid words fitting T _ O R O:
- TOWER – E excluded
- TUBRO – invalid
- TURRO – invalid
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – already guessed
- TROOP – valid (meaning a person who trots)

Given that TROOP is the only valid word fitting T _ O R O, and all letters are allowed (T, R, O, P), this must be the word.

So R must be at position 3.\n- Therefore the word must be T _ R R O – but that\'s invalid (R would be duplicated and position 4 would have R, but R is already at 4 and can\'t be duplicated? Actually the feedback didn\'t prohibit duplicates, so possible.)\n- Wait, no: the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates. So we can assume no duplicates.\n\nThus the word must be T _ R O, with R at position 3.\n\nValid words:\n- TAVOR – A excluded\n- TIGOR – I excluded\n- TOKOR – K excluded\n- TUNOR – not valid\n- TAVOR – A excluded\n- TONOR – valid (as in music)\n\nNo other obvious valid words. TONOR seems the only candidate.\n\nBut wait, let me think of others:\n- T D R O – no\n- T F R O – no\n- T G R O – no\n- T H R O – no\n- T M R O – no\n- T N R O – no\n- T P R O – no\n- T V R O – no\n- T W R O – no\n\nActually, none of these are valid. This suggests I might have missed a possibility.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe R is at position 3 and we have no evidence against it. The word could be T _ R O.\n\nValid words:\n- TONOR (as noted)\n- TROOP – but P is allowed, O is already confirmed at 5, but this would have O in position 2 and 4, which is allowed (no info against it)\n- TROOP is valid (meaning a person who trots)\n\nBut TROOP has O in position 2 and 4, which is possible.\n\nBetween TONOR and TROOP, both fit. But TONOR is more commonly recognized.\n\nI\'ll choose TONOR.\n\nBut wait, let me check if TONOR violates any constraints:\n- T O N O R: positions are T(1) O(2) N(3) O(4) R(5)\n- O is at 2 and 4 – no feedback against it.\n- R is at 5 – but position 4 in TURBO had R at 3, and feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not at 3. So R could be at 5.\n- So TONOR is valid.\n\nThus the guess is TONOR.\n\n<guess>TONOR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(x) C(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: TURBO -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) R(-) B(x) O(✓)\nGuess 4: TONOR -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(-) N(x) O(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Let's update what we now know after four guesses.\n\nLetters NOT in the word (x-feedback):\nS, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B, N\n\nLetters confirmed IN the word:\nT (must be the first letter)\nO (must be present, but feedback changed from ✓ to - in TONOR, so O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4)\nR (must be in the word, but feedback changed from - to - in TURBO and TONOR, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5)\n\nAdditional constraints:\n- T is fixed at position 1\n- O must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from TONOR feedback)\n- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from TURBO and TONOR feedback)\n- Therefore R must be in position 4, and O must be in position 3 or 5\n- But position 5 is already O (from O(✓) in TURBO), so O must be in position 3\n- Thus the word structure is T _ O R O, but this would have O in positions 3 and 5, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)\n- However, the feedback for TONOR showed O(-) at position 2 and 4, meaning O is in the word but not at those positions.

Let's update the state of knowledge after five guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
S, L, A, E, I, C, K, U, B, N, P

Letters confirmed IN the word:
T (must be the first letter)
O (must be present, but feedback changed from ✓ to - in TROOP, so O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4)
R (must be in the word, but feedback changed from - to - in TROOP, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5)
O (second O in TROOP was - at position 4, confirming O is in the word but not at 4)

So:
- T _ _ _ _
- O must be in the word, and can only be in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 1,3,4 are excluded for O)
- R must be in the word, and can only be in positions 3 or 4 (since positions 1,2,5 are excluded for R)
- Therefore positions must be:
  - Position 2: O or another letter
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: R or another letter
  - Position 5: O

Given O must be at 2 or 5, and R must be at 3 or 4, the only possible combinations are:
1. T O R _ O
2. T _ O R O
3. T _ _ O R (but R cannot be at 5, so this is invalid)
4. T _ _ R O (but O must be at 2 or 5, so this is invalid)

Thus the only possible structures are:
- T O R _ O
- T _ O R O

Looking at valid English words:
- TOWER – E excluded
- TUBRO – invalid
- TURRO – invalid
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – already guessed
- TROOP – already guessed
- TORSO – S excluded
- TROOP – already guessed

The only valid word fitting T _ O R O is TROOP, but we already guessed that and the second O in TROOP was - at position 4, meaning O is not at 4, so TROOP is invalid for position 4 O.

Realizing I might have missed: the word could have T, O, R, and another letter at positions 2,3,4,5 with O at 2 or 5 and R at 3 or 4.

Let's list possible positions:
- T _ _ _ _
- O can be at 2 or 5
- R can be at 3 or 4
- Other letters can be from remaining: D, F, G, H, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations:
- T O R _ _ – but then O is at 2, R at 3
- T O _ R _ – R at 4
- T _ O R _ – R at 4
- T _ _ R O – but O must be at 2 or 5, so invalid
- T _ _ O R – invalid (R at 5)

Thus the only viable structure is T O R _ _ or T _ O R _

Valid words:
- TOWER – E excluded
- TUBRO – invalid
- TURRO – invalid
- TIGOR – I excluded
- TAVOR – A excluded
- TONOR – valid (as in music)
- TORSO – S excluded
- TROOP – valid (as in trooping)

Given that TONOR is the only recognized word fitting T O R _ _, and TROOP was invalid for position 4, TONOR is the only remaining candidate.
