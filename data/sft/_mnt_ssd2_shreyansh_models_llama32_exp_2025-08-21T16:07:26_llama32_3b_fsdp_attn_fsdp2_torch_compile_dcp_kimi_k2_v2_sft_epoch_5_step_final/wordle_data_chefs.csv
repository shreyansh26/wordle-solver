### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, U, D  
Letters definitely IN the word: C (position 1), E (position 3), S  
Fixed positions so far:  
- Position 1 = C (✓)  
- Position 3 = E (✓)  

S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (because in CUSED it was in position 2 and got “-”).  
Therefore S must be in position 4.

Current partial word: C _ E S _

Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out (common ones): B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C
- Has E in position 3
- Has S in position 4
- Uses letters not yet eliminated for positions 2 and 5

A quick scan gives “CHESS”:
- C ✓, H not yet used, E ✓, S ✓ (position 4), S not yet forbidden.

But “CHESS” has two S’s and we only know one S exists. Still, it’s a valid 5-letter word and tests H and double-S.

A more likely single-S word is “CHEFS”:
- C ✓, H not eliminated, E ✓, F not eliminated, S in position 4.

Let’s go with “CHEFS”.
