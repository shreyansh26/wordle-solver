### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another option is ""SLATE"" which covers different letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- The O and S are not in their guessed positions (positions 3 and 4).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S (since they're in the word).
2. Avoids A, R, E (since they're not in the word).
3. Places O and S in different positions than before (O wasn't in position 3, S wasn't in position 4).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I'll try a word that uses common letters and repositions O and S. ""STOIC"" comes to mind:
- S is first (wasn't in position 4, so this is new).
- T is a new consonant.
- O is second (wasn't in position 3, so this is new).
- I is a new vowel (since E and A are out, O and I are left, but O is already confirmed).
- C is a new consonant.

But wait, ""STOIC"" has O in position 3 again, which was the same position as before; that's not allowed; O must not be in position 3. Similarly, S must not be in position 4.

Let me think of a word where:
- O is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

""SOILN"" comes to mind, but that's not a valid word. ""SOUND"" is valid:
- S is first (new position).
- O is second (new position).
- U is a new vowel.
- N and D are new consonants.

This seems good: it uses O and S in new positions, avoids A/R/E, and introduces new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- The O and S are not in their guessed positions (positions 3 and 4).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S (since they're in the word).
2. Avoids A, R, E (since they're not in the word).
3. Places O and S in different positions than before (O wasn't in position 3, S wasn't in position 4).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I'll try a word that uses common letters and repositions O and S. ""STOIC"" comes to mind:
- S is first (wasn't in position 4, so this is new).
- T is a new consonant.
- O is second (wasn't in position 3, so this is new).
- I is a new vowel (since E and A are out, O and I are left, but O is already confirmed).
- C is a new consonant.

But wait, ""STOIC"" has O in position 3 again, which was the same position as before; that's not allowed; O must not be in position 3. Similarly, S must not be in position 4.

Let me think of a word where:
- O is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

""SOILN"" comes to mind, but that's not a valid word. ""SOUND"" is valid:
- S is first (new position).
- O is second (new position).
- U is a new vowel.
- N and D are new consonants.

This seems good: it uses O and S in new positions, avoids A/R/E, and introduces new letters.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in word: A, R, E
   - Letters in word but wrong position: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - Letters not in word: U, D
   - Letters in word but wrong position: S, O, N

So the secret word must contain:
- O, S, N  (each confirmed as present)
and must NOT contain:
- A, R, E, U, D

Positions so far:
- O is NOT in positions 3 or 2.
- S is NOT in positions 4 or 1.
- N is NOT in position 4.

Let’s map valid positions for each required letter (1-indexed):

O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5

We still need two more consonants.  From the remaining unused common letters (avoiding A,R,E,U,D), good candidates are: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, Y.

I’ll try a word that places O, S, N in new legal positions and adds two fresh consonants.  A promising pattern is:

S _ O _ N   (but S can’t be in position 1 anyway)

Try “SCION”:
- S in position 1 – but S is forbidden in position 1 (from SOUND feedback).  Scratch that.

Try “SONIC”:
- S in position 1 – again forbidden.  Scratch.

Try “NOSY” – but Y is uncommon and we still need two more consonants.

Try “STONY”:
- S in position 1 – forbidden.

Try “TISON” – invalid word.

Try “FOIST”:
- F, I are new letters.
- O is in position 3 – forbidden.

Try “MOSIN” – invalid.

Valid word: “STOIC” – but O is in position 3 (forbidden).

Valid word: “SNORT” – contains R (forbidden).

Valid word: “NOISY”:
- N in position 1 (legal)
- O in position 2 (legal)

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:

- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another option is ""SLATE"" which covers different letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

- I in 2, 4, or 5

Option 1:
S _ N _ O
Fill blanks with new consonants: B, L → “SBNLO” – invalid.

Option 2:
S _ _ N O
Need two consonants in 2 and 3: “SCION” – S in 1 (forbidden).

Option 3:
_ S N _ O
Need consonants in 1 and 3: “BSNCO” – invalid.

Option 4:
_ _ S N O
Need consonants in 1 and 2: “BISON” – valid word!
- B and I are new letters.
- O in position 5 (legal)
- S in position 3 (legal)
- N in position 4 (legal)

This fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess BISON.

From the new feedback on BISON:
- B is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is NOT in position 3
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O is NOT in position 4
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → N is NOT in position 5

Recap of all constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word:
- I (fixed in position 2)
- O, S, N (all confirmed as present, but not yet placed correctly)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, E, U, D, Y, B

Positions still unknown:
- Position 1: must be one of the remaining consonants (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z) or possibly O, S, N, I (but I is already locked in position 2)
- Position 2: I (locked)
- Position 3: must be O, S, N (since S cannot be in position 3, and we know O and N are still loose)
- Position 4: must be O, S, N (same rules)
- Position 5: must be O, S, N (same rules)

But I is locked in position 2, so positions 3,4,5 can only be filled by O, S, N in some order.

Also:
- O is NOT in positions 2,3,4 (from earlier feedback) → but position 2 is I, so O must be in 1 or 5
- S is NOT in positions 1,3,4,5 → must be in 2... but 2 is I → contradiction.

Wait, re-read the feedback carefully:
BISON feedback:
B(x) I(✓) S(-) O(-) N(-)

This means:
- I is correct in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so S can be in 1,4,5)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so O can be in 1,3,5)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so N can be in 1,3)

So current knowns:
- Letters in word: I (fixed at 2), O, S, N
- Letters NOT in word: A,R,E,U,D,Y,B

Thus the secret word has:
- I in position 2
- O, S, N somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5
- Two additional consonants from remaining letters (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z)

Let’s list valid placements:
Possible positions:
- O can be 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4)
- S can be 1,4,5 (cannot be 2,3)
- N can be 1,3 (cannot be 2,4,5)

We need to place O, S, N in the remaining four positions (1,3,4,5) with the constraints above.

Let’s enumerate possible cases:

Case 1: O in 1
Then positions 3,4,5 must contain S and N in some order.
- S cannot be in 3 (already), so S can be in 4 or 5
- N cannot be in 5 (already), so N can be in 3 or 4

Subcases:
1a: O=1, S=4, N=3 → word: O N S _ I
2a: O=1, S=5, N=3 → word: O N _ S I
3a: O=1, S=5, N=4 → word: O _ N _ I

Case 2: O in 5
Then positions 3,4 must contain S and N in some order.
- S cannot be in 3 (already), so S can be in 4
- N cannot be in 5 (already), so N can be in 3 or 4

Subcases:
2b: O=5, S=4, N=3 → word: _ N S _ I
2c: O=5, S=4, N=1 → word: N _ S _ I
2d: O=5, S=3, N=4 → word: _ _ N S I (but S cannot be in 3)

Valid words from above:
- ONSET → but E is forbidden
- ONION → contains O twice (invalid)
- SONIC → C is new, but O in 3 (forbidden)
- SPICY → contains C and Y (Y forbidden)
- SNICK → contains C and K (both allowed)
  - S in 1 (allowed)
  - N in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 2 (correct)
  - C and K new

Check SNICK:
Letters: S,N,I,C,K – all allowed
Positions:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- I in 2 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another option is ""SLATE"" which covers different letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- The O and S are not in their guessed positions (positions 3 and 4).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S (since they're in the word).
2. Avoids A, R, E (since they're not in the word).
3. Places O and S in different positions than before (O wasn't in position 3, S wasn't in position 4).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I'll try a word that uses common letters and repositions O and S. ""STOIC"" comes to mind:
- S is first (wasn't in position 4, so this is new).
- T is a new consonant.
- O is second (wasn't in position 3, so this is new).
- I is a new vowel (since E and A are out, O and I are left, but O is already confirmed).
- C is a new consonant.

But wait, ""STOIC"" has O in position 3 again, which was the same position as before; that's not allowed; O must not be in position 3. Similarly, S must not be in position 4.

Let me think of a word where:
- O is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

""SOILN"" comes to mind, but that's not a valid word. ""SOUND"" is valid:
- S is first (new position).
- O is second (new position).
- U is a new vowel.
- N and D are new consonants.

This seems good: it uses O and S in new positions, avoids A/R/E, and introduces new letters.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in word: A, R, E
   - Letters in word but wrong position: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - Letters not in word: U, D
   - Letters in word but wrong position: S, O, N

So the secret word must contain:
- O, S, N  (each confirmed as present)
and must NOT contain:
- A, R, E, U, D

Positions so far:
- O is NOT in positions 3 or 2.
- S is NOT in positions 4 or 1.
- N is NOT in position 4.

Let’s map valid positions for each required letter (1-indexed):

O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5

We still need two more consonants.  From the remaining unused common letters (avoiding A,R,E,U,D), good candidates are: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, Y.

I’ll try a word that places O, S, N in new legal positions and adds two fresh consonants.  A promising pattern is:

S _ O _ N   (but S can’t be in position 1 anyway)

Try “SCION”:
- S in position 1 – but S is forbidden in position 1 (from SOUND feedback).  Scratch that.

Try “SONIC”:
- S in position 1 – again forbidden.  Scratch.

Try “NOSY” – but Y is uncommon and we still need two more consonants.

Try “STONY”:
- S in position 1 – forbidden.

Try “TISON” – invalid word.

Try “FOIST”:
- F, I are new letters.
- O is in position 3 – forbidden.

Try “MOSIN” – invalid.

Try “HONOS” – O in position 3, S in position 4 – both forbidden.

Let’s try a simpler pattern:  _  _  O  _  _
With O in position 3, S and N still to place, and two new consonants.

Valid word: “STOIC” – but O is in position 3 (forbidden).

Valid word: “SNORT” – contains R (forbidden).

Valid word: “SNOWY” – O in position 3 (forbidden).

Valid word: “NOISY”:
- N in position 1 (legal)
- O in position 2 (legal)
- I new
- S in position 4 (legal)
- Y new

This fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess NOISY.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: NOISY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(-) I(-) S(-) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   – Letters not in word: A, R, E
   – Letters in word but wrong position: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   – Additional letters not in word: U, D
   – Additional letters in word but wrong position: S, O, N

3. NOISY → N(-) O(-) I(-) S(-) Y(x)
   – Additional letters not in word: Y
   – N, O, I, S are all confirmed as present (but still in wrong positions)

So the secret word must contain:
- O, S, N, I  (all confirmed)
and must NOT contain:
- A, R, E, U, D, Y

Positions so far:
- O is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4
- S is NOT in positions 1, 4, 5
- N is NOT in positions 1, 4
- I is NOT in position 3

Valid positions for each required letter (1-indexed):
O: positions 1, 5
S: positions 2, 3
N: positions 2, 3, 5
I: positions 1, 2, 4, 5

We need two more consonants from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, K.

Let’s try a word that places O, S, N, I in still-allowed positions and adds two fresh consonants.

One legal arrangement is:
S _ N _ O
But we need a 5-letter word.

Try “SINUS” – contains S twice (invalid).

Try “SNICK” – contains C and K, both new.
- S in position 1 – forbidden (S cannot be in 1).

Try “SNOOK” – O in position 3 (forbidden).

Try “SNOUT” – U is forbidden.

Try “SNIPS” – P and S again (invalid).

Try “SNICK” again – S in 1 (forbidden).

Let’s pick a pattern:
- S in 2
- N in 3 or 5
- O in 1 or 5
- I in 2, 4, or 5

Option 1:
S _ N _ O
Fill blanks with new consonants: B, L → “SBNLO” – invalid.

Option 2:
S _ _ N O
Need two consonants in 2 and 3: “SCION” – S in 1 (forbidden).

Option 3:
_ S N _ O
Need consonants in 1 and 3: “BSNCO” – invalid.

Option 4:
_ _ S N O
Need consonants in 1 and 2: “BISON” – valid word!
- B and I are new letters.
- O in position 5 (legal)
- S in position 3 (legal)
- N in position 4 (legal)

This fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess BISON.

<guess>BISON</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: NOISY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(-) I(-) S(-) Y(x)
Guess 4: BISON -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) S(-) O(-) N(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on BISON:
- B is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is NOT in position 3
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O is NOT in position 4
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → N is NOT in position 5

Recap of all constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word:
- I (fixed in position 2)
- O, S, N (all confirmed as present, but not yet placed correctly)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, E, U, D, Y, B

Positions still unknown:
- Position 1: must be one of the remaining consonants (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z) or possibly O, S, N, I (but I is already locked in position 2)
- Position 2: I (locked)
- Position 3: must be O, S, N (since S cannot be in position 3, and we know O and N are still loose)
- Position 4: must be O, S, N (same rules)
- Position 5: must be O, S, N (same rules)

But I is locked in position 2, so positions 3,4,5 can only be filled by O, S, N in some order.

Also:
- O is NOT in positions 2,3,4 (from earlier feedback) → but position 2 is I, so O must be in 1 or 5
- S is NOT in positions 1,3,4,5 → must be in 2... but 2 is I → contradiction.

Wait, re-read the feedback carefully:
BISON feedback:
B(x) I(✓) S(-) O(-) N(-)

This means:
- I is correct in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so S can be in 1,4,5)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so O can be in 1,3,5)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so N can be in 1,3)

So current knowns:
- Letters in word: I (fixed at 2), O, S, N
- Letters NOT in word: A,R,E,U,D,Y,B

Thus the secret word has:
- I in position 2
- O, S, N somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5
- Two additional consonants from remaining letters (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z)

Let’s list valid placements:
Possible positions:
- O can be 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4)
- S can be 1,4,5 (cannot be 2,3)
- N can be 1,3 (cannot be 2,4,5)

We need to place O, S, N in the remaining four positions (1,3,4,5) with the constraints above.

Let’s enumerate possible cases:

Case 1: O in 1
Then positions 3,4,5 must contain S and N in some order.
- S cannot be in 3 (already), so S can be in 4 or 5
- N cannot be in 5 (already), so N can be in 3 or 4

Subcases:
1a: O=1, S=4, N=3 → word: O N S _ I
2a: O=1, S=5, N=3 → word: O N _ S I
3a: O=1, S=5, N=4 → word: O _ N _ I

Case 2: O in 5
Then positions 3,4 must contain S and N in some order.
- S cannot be in 3 (already), so S can be in 4
- N cannot be in 5 (already), so N can be in 3 or 4

Subcases:
2b: O=5, S=4, N=3 → word: _ N S _ I
2c: O=5, S=4, N=1 → word: N _ S _ I
2d: O=5, S=3, N=4 → word: _ _ N S I (but S cannot be in 3)

Valid words from above:
- ONSET → but E is forbidden
- ONION → contains O twice (invalid)
- SONIC → C is new, but O in 3 (forbidden)
- SPICY → contains C and Y (Y forbidden)
- SNICK → contains C and K (both allowed)
  - S in 1 (allowed)
  - N in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 2 (correct)
  - C and K new

Check SNICK:
Letters: S,N,I,C,K – all allowed
Positions:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- I in 2 (correct)
- C and K new

This fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess SNICK.

- S

- K

Letters known NOT to be in the word:

- Position 2: I (locked)
- Position 3: must be S, N, K (since I is locked in 2)
- Position 4: must be S, N, K (same rule)
- Position 5: must be S, N, K (same rule)

But we have only 4 letters confirmed (S,N,K,I). The word is 5 letters, so we need one more letter from the remaining allowed set.

Allowed additional consonants: F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Let’s place the confirmed letters:

Possible arrangements:
- S must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1,2,3 from feedback)
- N must be in 1,3, or 5 (cannot be 2,4)
- K must be in 1,3, or 4 (cannot be 5)

Let’s list valid positions:

Case 1: S in 3
Then N and K must occupy 1,4,5 with:
- N not in 2,4
- K not in 5

Subcases:
1a: S=3, N=1, K=4 → word: N _ S K I
   Valid? N _ S K I → need a 5th letter; but we've used I, S,K,N. Missing one more consonant. This would require N in 1, S in 3, K in 4, and a 5th letter not yet used. But we've already used I and K and N. Actually, this would be 5 letters: N _ S K I → need a consonant in position 5 that hasn't been used. But we've already confirmed I,S,K,N. The remaining letter must be one of F,G,H,J,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z. Let's try ""SNKI"" – but that's not a valid word.

Wait, we have I,S,N,K confirmed. The fifth letter must be one of these remaining consonants. Let's try ""SNICK"" – but C is forbidden.

Try ""SNOWI"" – but O is allowed, but W is allowed. But we have S,N,K,I. The fifth letter must be one of these. Let's try ""SNOWI"" – but this is 5 letters: S,N,O,W,I. But O is allowed, W is allowed. But we have S,N,K,I. The word would be ""SNOWI"" – but this is not in the allowed set.

Let me list valid words:

We have confirmed I,S,N,K. The fifth letter must be from remaining allowed consonants. Let's try:

""SNICK"" – C is forbidden.

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

""SNOUT"" – U is forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – P is allowed, but S is already in 3, P would be in 5. Then word is ""SNIPS"". Let's check:
- S in 1 – forbidden (from SNICK feedback: S is not in 1)
  
""SNIPS"" is invalid because S is in 1.

""SNIKS"" – K in 4, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N I K S
- Check positions:
  - S in 1 – forbidden (from SNICK feedback: S is not in 1)
  
""SNIGS"" – G is allowed, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N I G S
- S in 1 – forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 – forbidden.

""SNITS"" – T is allowed, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N I T S
- S in 1 – forbidden.

""SNIBS"" – B is forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – already saw S in 1 is forbidden.

""SNOKS"" – O is allowed (from earlier), K in 4, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N O K S
- Check constraints:
  - O is in 3 – but O is forbidden in 3 (from AROSE feedback: O is not in 3)
  - So this is invalid.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 forbidden.

""SNITS"" – S in 5 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), T in 4 (new), I in 2 (correct). Check letters: S,N,T,I,T – but T is duplicated. The word would be ""SNITS"" – but this is 5 letters: S N I T S. Check constraints:
- S in 5 (allowed, since S is only forbidden in 1,3,4,5 in previous guesses? Wait, let's re-examine:

From AROSE: S is in word but not in 4 (from SOUND: S not in 1,3; from NOISY: S not in 4; from BISON: S not in 3) → S is in word but not in 1,3,4 → S must be in 2 or 5
From SOUND: S not in 1 → S not in 1
From NOISY: S not in 4 → S not in 4
From BISON: S not in 3 → S not in 3
From SNICK: S not in 1 → already redundant.

So S must be in 2 or 5.

Similarly:
From AROSE: O not in 3 → O not in 3
From SOUND: O not in 2 → O not in 2
From NOISY: O not in 2 → redundant
From BISON: O not in 4 → O not in 4
From SNICK: O not in 3 → redundant

So O must be in 1 or 5

From SOUND: N not in 4 → N not in 4
From NOISY: N not in 1 → N not in 1
From BISON: N not in 5 → N not in 5
From SNICK: N not in 2 → N not in 2

So N must be in 3 or 4

From SNICK: K not in 5 → K not in 5
From BISON: K not in 4 → K not in 4
From SNICK: K not in 3 → K not in 3
So K must be in 1 or 2

Now let's enumerate:

Case 1: S in 2
Then:
- I is in 2 (fixed)
- K must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 3,5)
- N must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 1,2,5)
- O must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4)

Subcases:
1a: S=2, K=1, N=3, O=5 → word: K S I N O
   Valid word: ""K SIN O"" – but this is not a valid English word.

1b: S=2, K=1, N=4, O=5 → word: K S I N O – invalid.

1c: S=2, K=4, N=3, O=1 → word: O N I K S – but O in 1 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed). Check letters: O,N,I,K,S – all allowed, and valid English word ""ONIKS"" – no, not valid.

1d: S=2, K=4, N=5 – but N cannot be in 5 (from BISON feedback: N not in 5).

Case 2: S in 5
Then:
- I is in 2 (fixed)
- K must be in 1 or 3 or 4
- N must be in 1,3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- O must be in 1,3 (cannot be 2,4,5)

Subcases:
2a: S=5, K=1, N=3, O=1 → word: O N I K S – invalid.

2b: S=5, K=1, N=3, O=5 – duplicate O.

2c: S=5, K=1, N=4, O=3 – but O cannot be in 3 (from AROSE).

2d: S=5, K=3, N=1, O=3 – invalid.

2e: S=5, K=4, N=1, O=3 – same issue.

2f: S=5, K=4, N=3, O=1 – word: O N I K S – invalid.

2g: S=5, K=4, N=1, O=3 – same invalid.

2h: S=5, K=1, N=4, O=3 – same invalid.

2i: S=5, K=1, N=3, O=5 – duplicate O.

2j: S=5, K=1, N=5 – N cannot be in 5.

2k: S=5, K=3, N=4, O=1 – word: O _ K N S – but position 3 must be K, 4 N, 5 S. So ""ONKNS"" – invalid.

2l: S=5, K=4, N=3, O=1 – ""ONK S"" – invalid.

2m: S=5, K=4, N=1, O=3 – ""ONK S"" – invalid.

2p: S=5, K=1, N=4, O=3 – ""ONK S"" – invalid.

2q: S=5, K=1, N=3, O=5 – duplicate O.

2r: S=5, K=3, N=1, O=5 – ""NSK O5"" – invalid.

2s: S=5, K=1, N=5 – N cannot be in 5.

3. Realize we have four confirmed letters (I,S,N,K) and the word is 5 letters, so we need one more consonant from remaining allowed set. The most common remaining consonants are F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W.

Let’s try:

- Place I in 2
- Place S in 5 (allowed)
- Place N in 3 (allowed)
- Place K in 1 (allowed)
- Place the fifth letter with remaining consonant.

Word: K I N S _ – need a consonant in 5. The only valid English word here is ""KINSE"" – invalid.

Alternative approach: list valid 5-letter English words meeting all constraints.

Using a word list filter:
- Must contain I,S,N,K
- Must not contain A,R,E,U,D,Y,B,C
- Must have I in 2
- Must have O in 1 or 5
- Must have S in 2 or 5
- Must have N in 3 or 4
- Must have K in 1,3,4

After filtering, a valid word is ""KININ"" – invalid.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 (forbidden).

""SNITS"" – T is allowed, but S in 1 (forbidden).

""SNOWS"" – O in 3 (forbidden).

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

""SNOWK"" – invalid.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 (forbidden).

""SNITS"" – S in 1 (forbidden).

""SNOWS"" – O in 3 (forbidden).

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine possible words:

From a word list, a valid word fitting all constraints is ""SNIPS"" – but S in 1 is forbidden.

Another: ""SNITS"" – S in 1 is forbidden.

""SNOWS"" – O in 3 is forbidden.

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

""SNOKS"" – O in 3 is forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 is forbidden.

""SNITS"" – S in 1 is forbidden.

""SNOWS"" – O in 3 is forbidden.

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

Hmm, seems like no valid words fit directly. Maybe I missed a word.

Wait, let's try:

""SNIPS"" – invalid.

""SNITS"" – invalid.

""SNOWS"" – invalid.

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

""SNOKS"" – invalid.

""SNIPS"" – invalid.

This suggests we might need to use a different approach. Let me re-express constraints as equations:

Let's represent positions as:

1: ?  
2: I (fixed)  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: ?

Required letters: S, N, K, I

Constraints:
- S: not 1,3,4 → must be 2 or 5
- N: not 1,2,4,5 → must be 3
- K: not 3,4,5 → must be 1
- O: not 2,3,4 → must be 1 or 5
- Position 2 is I

So the word must be:
K I N S _  or  K I N _ S

But N is in 3, so:

K I N _ S → need a consonant in 4
Valid word: ""KINCS"" – invalid.

""KINFS"" – invalid.

""KINHS"" – invalid.

""KINLS"" – invalid.

""KINMS"" – invalid.

""KINPS"" – invalid.

""KINQS"" – invalid.

""KINTS"" – valid English word!

Check constraints:
- K in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (correct)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- T new, allowed
- S in 5 (allowed)

All constraints satisfied.

Thus, the next guess is KINTS.
</think>

<guess>KINTS</guess>",KINTS,"From the new feedback on SNICK:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- K is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

Recap of all constraints so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- I (fixed in position 2)
- S
- N
- K

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, E, U, D, Y, B, C

Positions still unknown:
- Position 1: must be one of S, N, K (since C is out) or possibly remaining consonants (but we've already confirmed S,N,K are present)
- Position 2: I (locked)
- Position 3: must be S, N, K (since I is locked in 2)
- Position 4: must be S, N, K (same rule)
- Position 5: must be S, N, K (same rule)

But we have only 4 letters confirmed (S,N,K,I). The word is 5 letters, so we need one more letter from the remaining allowed set.

Allowed additional consonants: F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Let’s place the confirmed letters:

Possible arrangements:
- S must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1,2,3 from feedback)
- N must be in 1,3, or 5 (cannot be 2,4)
- K must be in 1,3, or 4 (cannot be 5)

Let’s list valid positions:

Case 1: S in 3
Then N and K must occupy 1,4,5 with:
- N not in 2,4
- K not in 5

Subcases:
1a: S=3, N=1, K=4 → word: N _ S K I
   Valid? N _ S K I → need a 5th letter; but we've used I, S,K,N. Missing one more consonant. This would require N in 1, S in 3, K in 4, and a 5th letter not yet used. But we've already used I and K and N. Actually, this would be 5 letters: N _ S K I → need a consonant in position 5 that hasn't been used. But we've already confirmed I,S,K,N. The remaining letter must be one of F,G,H,J,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z. Let's try ""SNKI"" – but that's not a valid word.

Wait, we have I,S,N,K confirmed. The fifth letter must be one of these remaining consonants. Let's try ""SNICK"" – but C is forbidden.

Try ""SNOWI"" – but O is allowed, but W is allowed. But we have S,N,K,I. The fifth letter must be one of these. Let's try ""SNOWI"" – but this is 5 letters: S,N,O,W,I. But O is allowed, W is allowed. But we have S,N,K,I. The word would be ""SNOWI"" – but this is not in the allowed set.

Let me list valid words:

We have confirmed I,S,N,K. The fifth letter must be from remaining allowed consonants. Let's try:

""SNICK"" – C is forbidden.

""SNOWI"" – invalid.

""SNOUT"" – U is forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – P is allowed, but S is already in 3, P would be in 5. Then word is ""SNIPS"". Let's check:
- S in 1 – forbidden (from SNICK feedback: S is not in 1)
  
""SNIPS"" is invalid because S is in 1.

""SNIKS"" – K in 4, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N I K S
- Check positions:
  - S in 1 – forbidden (from SNICK feedback: S is not in 1)
  
""SNIGS"" – G is allowed, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N I G S
- S in 1 – forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 – forbidden.

""SNITS"" – T is allowed, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N I T S
- S in 1 – forbidden.

""SNIBS"" – B is forbidden.

""SNIPS"" – already saw S in 1 is forbidden.

""SNOKS"" – O is allowed (from earlier), K in 4, S in 5, N in 1:
- Word: S N O K S
- Check constraints:
  - O is in 3 – but O is forbidden in 3 (from AROSE feedback: O is not in 3)
  - So this is invalid.

""SNIPS"" – S in 1 forbidden.

""SNITS"" – S in 5 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), T in 4 (new), I in 2 (correct). Check letters: S,N,T,I,T – but T is duplicated. The word would be ""SNITS"" – but this is 5 letters: S N I T S. Check constraints:
- S in 5 (allowed, since S is only forbidden in 1,3,4,5 in previous guesses? Wait, let's re-examine:

From AROSE: S is in word but not in 4 (from SOUND: S not in 1,3; from NOISY: S not in 4; from BISON: S not in 3) → S is in word but not in 1,3,4 → S must be in 2 or 5

From AROSE: O not in 3 → O not in 3
From SOUND: O not in 2 → O not in 2
From NOISY: O not in 2 → redundant
From BISON: O not in 4 → O not in 4
From SNICK: O not in 3 → redundant

So O must be in 1 or 5

From SOUND: N not in 4 → N not in 4
From NOISY: N not in 1 → N not in 1
From BISON: N not in 5 → N not in 5
From SNICK: N not in 2 → N not in 2

So N must be in 3 or 4

From SNICK: K not in 5 → K not in 5
From BISON: K not in 4 → K not in 4
From SNICK: K not in 3 → K not in 3
So K must be in 1 or 2

Now let's enumerate:
