For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. If any of these letters are in the secret word, I'll get good information about their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the 3rd position.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, etc.).

A good next step is to test more common letters while placing A in a different spot. The word ""RADIO"" comes to mind:
- R: common consonant, not ruled out.
- A: already confirmed to be in the word, placing it in position 2 instead of 3.
- D: common consonant, not ruled out.
- I: common vowel, not ruled out.
- O: common vowel, not ruled out.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters while respecting the constraints.

- A is still in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D and O are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, D, O.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- D cannot be in position 3 (it was in position 3 in RADIO and got “-”).
- O cannot be in position 5 (it was in position 5 in RADIO and got “-”).

1. Contains A, D, and O.
2. Places A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.
3. Places D somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 5.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, E, R, I).

Let’s try to spread A, D, O along the remaining valid positions and pick some other consonants from the still-allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “ADOPT”:
- A in position 1 (valid; not positions 2 or 3).
- D in position 2 (valid; not position 3).
- O in position 3 (valid; not position 5).
- P and T: T is already ruled out, so swap or remove P if T is out.

Wait, T is already out from round 1. Let’s replace T with another allowed consonant: “ADOPT” is invalid because of T.

Next candidate: “ACORN” – but R and N are both ruled out or untested.

Better: “AMIDO” – but it has two I’s and I is ruled out.

Try “ACORN” again, but remove the R: “ACORN” is still invalid (N is okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is fine).

Actually, let’s build something fresh: a word with A, D, O plus two new consonants.

How about “MANGO”?
- M, G, N, G, O: but G is repeated and we don’t know if G is in the word.
Also, O is in position 5 here, which is invalid.

Try “CANAL” – but L is ruled out.

Try “MADON”:
- M, A, D, O, N: all letters are allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – but A cannot be in 2. So invalid.

Try “COBRA” – but R is ruled out.

Try “DANGO”:
- D, A, N, G, O: all allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – invalid.

Try “OCEAN”:
- O, C, E, A, N: but E is ruled out.

Try “DAMON”:

- Positions: A in 2 – invalid.

Try “DONUT” – but T is ruled out.

- Must contain A, D, O.
- A not in 2 or 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. If any of these letters are in the secret word, I'll get good information about their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the 3rd position.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, etc.).

A good next step is to test more common letters while placing A in a different spot. The word ""RADIO"" comes to mind:
- R: common consonant, not ruled out.
- A: already confirmed to be in the word, placing it in position 2 instead of 3.
- D: common consonant, not ruled out.
- I: common vowel, not ruled out.
- O: common vowel, not ruled out.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters while respecting the constraints.

<guess>RADIO</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(x) O(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, T, E are out.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Round 2 (RADIO):
- R, I are out.
- A is still in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D and O are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, D, O.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- D cannot be in position 3 (it was in position 3 in RADIO and got “-”).
- O cannot be in position 5 (it was in position 5 in RADIO and got “-”).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, D, and O.
2. Places A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.
3. Places D somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 5.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, E, R, I).

Let’s try to spread A, D, O along the remaining valid positions and pick some other consonants from the still-allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “ADOPT”:
- A in position 1 (valid; not positions 2 or 3).
- D in position 2 (valid; not position 3).
- O in position 3 (valid; not position 5).
- P and T: T is already ruled out, so swap or remove P if T is out.

Wait, T is already out from round 1. Let’s replace T with another allowed consonant: “ADOPT” is invalid because of T.

Next candidate: “ACORN” – but R and N are both ruled out or untested.

Better: “AMIDO” – but it has two I’s and I is ruled out.

Try “ACORN” again, but remove the R: “ACORN” is still invalid (N is okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is fine).

Actually, let’s build something fresh: a word with A, D, O plus two new consonants.

How about “MANGO”?
- M, G, N, G, O: but G is repeated and we don’t know if G is in the word.
Also, O is in position 5 here, which is invalid.

Try “CANAL” – but L is ruled out.

Try “MADON”:
- M, A, D, O, N: all letters are allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – but A cannot be in 2. So invalid.

Try “COBRA” – but R is ruled out.

Try “DANGO”:
- D, A, N, G, O: all allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – invalid.

Try “OCEAN”:
- O, C, E, A, N: but E is ruled out.

Try “DAMON”:
- D, A, M, O, N: all allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – invalid.

Try “DONUT” – but T is ruled out.

Try “ADOPT” again, but replace T with “COBRA” – no, T is out.

Let’s list the constraints clearly:
- Must contain A, D, O.
- A not in 2 or 3.
- D not in 3.
- O not in 5.
- No S, L, T, E, R, I.

A valid word: “MADON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “COBRA” – R is out.

Another: “ADOPT” – T is out.

Another: “ACORN” – R and N: R is out.

Another: “DANGO” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “DONUT” – T is out.

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “GAMON”:
- G, A, M, O, N: all allowed.
- A in 2 – invalid.

Another: “HABIT” – B, I, T: I and T are out.

Another: “CABIN” – B, I, N: I is out.

Another: “PANDA” – P, A, N, D, A: A repeated, but A is allowed. Positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “DANCO” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “CANAL” – L is out.

Another: “MADAM” – M, A, D, M, A: A repeated, but valid. Positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “COBIA” – C, O, B, I, A: I is out.

Another: “ADOBE” – B, E: E is out.

Another: “AMIDO” – I is out.

Another: “ACORN” – R is out.

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “DANGO” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “DONUT” – T is out.

Another: “COBRA” – R is out.

Another: “GAMON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “HABIT” – T is out.

Another: “PANDA” – P, A, N, D, A: A repeated. Positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “MADON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “COBIA” – I is out.

Another: “CANAL” – L is out.

Another: “ACORN” – R is out.

Another: “ADOPT” – T is out.

Another: “COBRA” – R is out.

Another: “DONUT” – T is out.

Another: “GAMON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “HABIT” – T is out.

Another: “MADAM” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “PANDA” – P, A, N, D, A: A repeated, but positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “WAGON” – O in 2 (valid), A in 3 (invalid), G, O, N: A is out.

Another: “VODKA” – V, O, D, K, A: positions: A in 5 (valid), O in 2 (valid), D in 3 (valid). But K is allowed.

“VODKA”:
- V, O, D, K, A: all allowed letters.
- Positions: A in 5 (ok), O in 2 (ok), D in 3 (ok).
- No ruled-out letters.

This looks good. Let’s go with VODKA.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. If any of these letters are in the secret word, I'll get good information about their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the 3rd position.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, etc.).

A good next step is to test more common letters while placing A in a different spot. The word ""RADIO"" comes to mind:
- R: common consonant, not ruled out.
- A: already confirmed to be in the word, placing it in position 2 instead of 3.
- D: common consonant, not ruled out.
- I: common vowel, not ruled out.
- O: common vowel, not ruled out.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters while respecting the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(x) O(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, T, E are out.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Round 2 (RADIO):
- R, I are out.
- A is still in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D and O are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, D, O.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- D cannot be in position 3 (it was in position 3 in RADIO and got “-”).
- O cannot be in position 5 (it was in position 5 in RADIO and got “-”).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, D, and O.
2. Places A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.
3. Places D somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 5.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, E, R, I).

Let’s try to spread A, D, O along the remaining valid positions and pick some other consonants from the still-allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “ADOPT”:
- A in position 1 (valid; not positions 2 or 3).
- D in position 2 (valid; not position 3).
- O in position 3 (valid; not position 5).
- P and T: T is already ruled out, so swap or remove P if T is out.

Wait, T is already out from round 1. Let’s replace T with another allowed consonant: “ADOPT” is invalid because of T.

Next candidate: “ACORN” – but R and N are both ruled out or untested.

Better: “AMIDO” – but it has two I’s and I is ruled out.

Try “ACORN” again, but remove the R: “ACORN” is still invalid (N is okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is fine).

Actually, let’s build something fresh: a word with A, D, O plus two new consonants.

How about “MANGO”?
- M, G, N, G, O: but G is repeated and we don’t know if G is in the word.
Also, O is in position 5 here, which is invalid.

Try “CANAL” – but L is ruled out.

Try “MADON”:
- M, A, D, O, N: all letters are allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – but A cannot be in 2. So invalid.

Try “COBRA” – but R is ruled out.

Try “DANGO”:
- D, A, N, G, O: all allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – invalid.

Try “OCEAN”:
- O, C, E, A, N: but E is ruled out.

Try “DAMON”:
- D, A, M, O, N: all allowed.
- Positions: A in 2 – invalid.

Try “DONUT” – but T is ruled out.

Try “ADOPT” again, but replace T with “COBRA” – no, T is out.

Let’s list the constraints clearly:
- Must contain A, D, O.
- A not in 2 or 3.
- D not in 3.
- O not in 5.
- No S, L, T, E, R, I.

A valid word: “MADON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “COBRA” – R is out.

Another: “ADOPT” – T is out.

Another: “ACORN” – R and N: R is out.

Another: “DANGO” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “DONUT” – T is out.

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “GAMON”:
- G, A, M, O, N: all allowed.
- A in 2 – invalid.

Another: “HABIT” – B, I, T: I and T are out.

Another: “CABIN” – B, I, N: I is out.

Another: “PANDA” – P, A, N, D, A: A repeated, but A is allowed. Positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “DANCO” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “CANAL” – L is out.

Another: “MADAM” – M, A, D, M, A: A repeated, but valid. Positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “COBIA” – C, O, B, I, A: I is out.

Another: “ADOBE” – B, E: E is out.

Another: “AMIDO” – I is out.

Another: “ACORN” – R is out.

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “DANGO” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “DONUT” – T is out.

Another: “COBRA” – R is out.

Another: “GAMON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “HABIT” – T is out.

Another: “PANDA” – P, A, N, D, A: A repeated. Positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “MADON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “COBIA” – I is out.

Another: “CANAL” – L is out.

Another: “ACORN” – R is out.

Another: “ADOPT” – T is out.

Another: “COBRA” – R is out.

Another: “DONUT” – T is out.

Another: “GAMON” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “HABIT” – T is out.

Another: “MADAM” – A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “MANGO” – O in 5 (invalid).

Another: “PANDA” – P, A, N, D, A: A repeated, but positions: A in 2 (invalid).

Another: “WAGON” – O in 2 (valid), A in 3 (invalid), G, O, N: A is out.

Another: “VODKA” – V, O, D, K, A: positions: A in 5 (valid), O in 2 (valid), D in 3 (valid). But K is allowed.

“VODKA”:
- V, O, D, K, A: all allowed letters.
- Positions: A in 5 (ok), O in 2 (ok), D in 3 (ok).
- No ruled-out letters.

This looks good. Let’s go with VODKA.

<guess>VODKA</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: VODKA -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(✓) D(-) K(x) A(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on VODKA:
- V and K are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so O is in position 2.
- D is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so D is somewhere other than position 3.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so A is in position 5.

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ A, and must include D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 3 is already ruled out for D from RADIO feedback).

Letters we now know:
- Must have: O (fixed at 2), A (fixed at 5), D (somewhere in 1, 3, or 4).
- Cannot have: S, L, T, E, R, I, V, K.

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and A in position 5.
- Has D in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- D O _ _ A
- _ O D _ A
- _ O _ D A

For DO___A, possible consonants for the 3rd and 4th positions from allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting this: “DOUMA” – but U and M are allowed. Check positions:
- D (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – correct.
- U (3) – allowed.
- M (4) – allowed.
- A (5) – correct.

But is “DOUMA” a valid English word? It’s a variant spelling of “dumplin” or “dooma”, but might be accepted in Wordle.

Another common word: “DOGMA”:
- D (1), O (2), G (3), M (4), A (5).
- All letters allowed.
- D in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (correct), G in 3 (allowed), M in 4 (allowed), A in 5 (correct).

“DOGMA” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with DOGMA.
