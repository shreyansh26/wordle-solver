### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S
- Letters not in the word: R, E
- Need a 5-letter word that contains A, O, S but not R, E, and the A, O, S cannot be in their original positions (1, 3, 4 respectively).

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st → can be 2,3,4,5
- O cannot be 3rd → can be 1,2,4,5
- S cannot be 4th → can be 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words with A, O, S but not R, E. Some candidates:
- SALON (but has N which might be useful, but L hasn't been tested yet)
- SOAKY (but Y might be too uncommon)
- STOIC (but has C and I which weren't tested)
- SPOON (but has N and double O)
- AFOOT (but has F and T which weren't tested)

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need a word with A, O, S but not R, E. Let's try ""STOAT"" - but that has T and A in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 1, T in position 4, A in position 5. But we have A twice which might not be optimal.

Better word might be ""SALON"" - but this has A in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 1. But O was originally in position 3 (wrong), so this might not help.

Alternative approach: Since A, O, S must be somewhere else, let's try ""SALON"" - but O is still in position 3 which was wrong, so this is bad.

Better: ""STOIC"" - but this has O in position 2, S in position 1, A in position 3, I in position 4, C in position 5. This seems good:
- S is now in position 1 (originally 4, so new position is allowed)
- A is now in position 3 (originally 1, so new position is allowed)
- O is now in position 2 (originally 3, so new position is allowed)
- Doesn't use R or E
- Uses new letters T, I, C

This seems like a strong second guess.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S
- Letters not in the word: R, E
- Need a 5-letter word that contains A, O, S but not R, E, and the A, O, S cannot be in their original positions (1, 3, 4 respectively).

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st → can be 2,3,4,5
- O cannot be 3rd → can be 1,2,4,5
- S cannot be 4th → can be 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words with A, O, S but not R, E. Some candidates:
- SALON (but has N which might be useful, but L hasn't been tested yet)
- SOAKY (but Y might be too uncommon)
- STOIC (but has C and I which weren't tested)
- SPOON (but has N and double O)
- AFOOT (but has F and T which weren't tested)

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need a word with A, O, S but not R, E. Let's try ""STOAT"" - but that has T and A in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 1, T in position 4, A in position 5. But we have A twice which might not be optimal.

Better word might be ""SALON"" - but this has A in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 1. But O was originally in position 3 (wrong), so this might not help.

Alternative approach: Since A, O, S must be somewhere else, let's try ""SALON"" - but O is still in position 3 which was wrong, so this is bad.

Better: ""STOIC"" - but this has O in position 2, S in position 1, A in position 3, I in position 4, C in position 5. This seems good:
- S is now in position 1 (originally 4, so new position is allowed)
- A is now in position 3 (originally 1, so new position is allowed)
- O is now in position 2 (originally 3, so new position is allowed)
- Doesn't use R or E
- Uses new letters T, I, C

This seems like a strong second guess.

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R, E are not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S is in the word but not in position 4

Guess 2: STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- T, I, C are not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known) or now position 2

So combining:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, T, I, C
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1
  – O cannot be 2 or 3
  – S cannot be 1 or 4

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for O: 1,4,5  
Possible positions for S: 2,3,5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S
2. Does NOT contain R,E,T,I,C
3. Respects the position bans above

Let’s look for a word with A, O, S plus two other unused consonants.  
Available consonants (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Try to place A, O, S without violating positions.

Option: S A L O N  
- S in 1 → banned (S cannot be 1) → discard

Option: O A S L Y  
- O in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), L and Y unused → looks good

Another option: S P A O N  
- S in 1 → banned → discard

Another: A S O L D  
- A in 1 → banned → discard

O A S L Y seems valid.

Let me check: O A S L Y  
- Contains A, O, S  
- No R, E, T, I, C  
- A not in 1, O not in 2 or 3, S not in 1 or 4  
- Uses new letters L, Y

This is a strong candidate.

Combining all feedback so far:
Known letters in word: O, A, S
Known letters NOT in word: R, E, T, I, C, L, Y
Known position:
- O is fixed at position 1 (✓)

Position bans:
- A cannot be 1 (from AROSE) or 2 (from OASLY)
- S cannot be 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STOIC) or 3 (from OASLY)

So:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5

- O is locked at 1

We need a 5-letter word starting with O, containing A and S, avoiding all banned letters (R,E,T,I,C,L,Y), and respecting the position bans.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let's try:

- Position 2: ? (must be from allowed letters)
- Position 3: A (allowed: 3,4,5)
- Position 4: ? (must be from allowed letters)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

We need a 5-letter word starting with O, containing A and S, avoiding all banned letters (R,E,T,I,C,L,Y), and respecting the position bans.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let's try:
- Position 1: O (fixed)
- Position 2: ? (must be from allowed letters)
- Position 3: A (allowed: 3,4,5)
- Position 4: ? (must be from allowed letters)
- Position 5: S (allowed: 2,5)

Option: O B A S ? – but we need 5 letters, so O B A S N → OBASN (but OBASN isn't a word)

Another: O N A S ? – ONAS? – not valid

Option: O B A S ? – OBAS? – no

Wait, let's think systematically:
We have:
O _ _ _ _
With A and S somewhere in positions 3,4,5 and 2,5 respectively.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2:
  O S _ A _
  Then A must be in 3,4,5
  But position 3 is already A, so:
  O S A _ _
  Need two more letters from allowed set (B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
  And avoid banned letters.

  Possible: O S A N D (OSAND? No)
  O S A N K (OSANK? No)
  O S A M B (OSAMB? No)

- If S is in position 5:
  O _ A _ S
  Then positions 2 and 4 need letters from allowed set.
  Possible: O B A N S (OBANS? No)
  O M A N S (OMANS? No)
  O P A N S (OPANS? No)
  O G A N S (OGANS? Yes! ""OGANS"" is a valid word)

Let's check OGANS:
- Starts with O (correct)
- Contains A (position 3, allowed) and S (position 5, allowed)
- No banned letters (R,E,T,I,C,L,Y)
- No duplicates of already known letters

This seems valid.

From the new feedback on OGANS:
- O is correct at position 1 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- S is correct at position 5 (✓)

So we now know:
- Word starts with O and ends with S
- Must contain A somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are taken by O,G,N,S respectively)
- Letters not in the word: R,E,T,I,C,L,Y,G,N
- Available letters: B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Position constraints:
- A must be in position 2 or 4
- Position 3 is not A (from AROSE and OGANS feedback)
- Position 4 is not N (from OGANS) and must be A or another letter
- Position 2 or 4 for A

Let's explore possibilities:

Option 1: A in position 2
O A _ _ S
Then position 3 must be from remaining allowed letters (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
But A is already in position 2, so position 3 can be any allowed letter.

Possible words:
- O A B _ S → OAB_S → OABAS (invalid, not a word)
- O A M _ S → OAM_S → OAMBS (invalid)
- O A F _ S → OAF_S → OAFES (invalid, has E)
- O A D _ S → OAD_S → OADS (invalid, 4 letters)

- O A V _ S → OAV_S → OAVES (invalid, has E)
- O A W _ S → OAW_S → OAWNS (invalid, has N)
- O A K _ S → OAK_S → OAKED (invalid, has E)
- O A M _ S → OAM_S → OAMBS (invalid)
- O A D _ S → OAD_S → OADS (invalid)

Option 2: A in position 4
O _ _ A S
Then positions 2 and 3 must be from allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- O B D A S (OBDAS? No)
- O B M A S (OBMAS? No)
- O D M A S (ODMAS? No)
- O F M A S (OFMAS? No)
- O B A S S – but S is already at 5
- O M B A S (OMBAS? No)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Wait, let's try:
O B A S S – but this has S twice, and we know S is only at position 5. Also, A would be at position 3, but from AROSE and OGANS, A cannot be at 3 (AROSE had A at 1 and feedback said -, meaning A is in word but not 1; OGANS had A at 3 and feedback was -). So A cannot be at 3. So A must be at 2 or 4.

But in OGANS, A was at 3 and got -, so A is not at 3. Therefore A must be at 2 or 4.

So possible:
- O A _ _ S
- O _ _ A S

Let's explore O _ _ A S:
Positions 2 and 3 must be from allowed letters (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
Possible:

- O W M A S (OWMAS? No)

None seem valid. Let me re-examine allowed letters.

Wait, let's try:
O B A S S – but this has S twice, and we know S is at 5. Also, A would be at 3, but A cannot be at 3 (from AROSE and OGANS feedback). So this is invalid.

Let me list possible words systematically:
Valid English words starting with O, ending with S, containing A, no banned letters:
- OASPS – but has P,S and A at 2, but S is at 5, so OASPS would be O A S P S – but S is already at 5, so this would be O A S P S. Check:
  - O at 1 ✓
  - A at 2 (allowed)
  - S at 3 (allowed – S only banned at 1,4)
  - P at 4 (allowed)
  - S at 5 ✓
  - No banned letters
  - OASPS is a valid word!

Let me verify:
- OASPS: O(✓), A(-) but wait, A is at 2 (allowed), S at 3 (allowed), P at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (correct). This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: OAMPS – but M and P are allowed, but this is not a common word.

OASPS seems the most plausible valid word.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- O is fixed at position 1
- S is fixed at position 5
- A must be present, but cannot be at positions 1,3,5 (from earlier feedback)
- Therefore A must be at position 2 or 4

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S
- Letters not in the word: R, E
- Need a 5-letter word that contains A, O, S but not R, E, and the A, O, S cannot be in their original positions (1, 3, 4 respectively).

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st → can be 2,3,4,5
- O cannot be 3rd → can be 1,2,4,5
- S cannot be 4th → can be 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words with A, O, S but not R, E. Some candidates:
- SALON (but has N which might be useful, but L hasn't been tested yet)
- SOAKY (but Y might be too uncommon)
- STOIC (but has C and I which weren't tested)
- SPOON (but has N and double O)
- AFOOT (but has F and T which weren't tested)

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need a word with A, O, S but not R, E. Let's try ""STOAT"" - but that has T and A in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 1, T in position 4, A in position 5. But we have A twice which might not be optimal.

Better word might be ""SALON"" - but this has A in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 1. But O was originally in position 3 (wrong), so this might not help.

Alternative approach: Since A, O, S must be somewhere else, let's try ""SALON"" - but O is still in position 3 which was wrong, so this is bad.

Better: ""STOIC"" - but this has O in position 2, S in position 1, A in position 3, I in position 4, C in position 5. This seems good:
- S is now in position 1 (originally 4, so new position is allowed)
- A is now in position 3 (originally 1, so new position is allowed)
- O is now in position 2 (originally 3, so new position is allowed)
- Doesn't use R or E
- Uses new letters T, I, C

This seems like a strong second guess.

<guess>STOIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R, E are not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S is in the word but not in position 4

Guess 2: STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- T, I, C are not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known) or now position 2

So combining:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, T, I, C
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1
  – O cannot be 2 or 3
  – S cannot be 1 or 4

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for O: 1,4,5  
Possible positions for S: 2,3,5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S
2. Does NOT contain R,E,T,I,C
3. Respects the position bans above

Let’s look for a word with A, O, S plus two other unused consonants.  
Available consonants (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Try to place A, O, S without violating positions.

Option: S A L O N  
- S in 1 → banned (S cannot be 1) → discard

Option: O A S L Y  
- O in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), L and Y unused → looks good

Another option: S P A O N  
- S in 1 → banned → discard

Another: A S O L D  
- A in 1 → banned → discard

O A S L Y seems valid.

Let me check: O A S L Y  
- Contains A, O, S  
- No R, E, T, I, C  
- A not in 1, O not in 2 or 3, S not in 1 or 4  
- Uses new letters L, Y

This is a strong candidate.

<guess>OASLY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: OASLY -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) S(-) L(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on OASLY:
- O is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- L, Y are not in the word

Combining all feedback so far:
Known letters in word: O, A, S
Known letters NOT in word: R, E, T, I, C, L, Y
Known position:
- O is fixed at position 1 (✓)

Position bans:
- A cannot be 1 (from AROSE) or 2 (from OASLY)
- S cannot be 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STOIC) or 3 (from OASLY)

So:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- O is locked at 1

We need a 5-letter word starting with O, containing A and S, avoiding all banned letters (R,E,T,I,C,L,Y), and respecting the position bans.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let's try:
- Position 1: O (fixed)
- Position 2: ? (must be from allowed letters)
- Position 3: A (allowed: 3,4,5)
- Position 4: ? (must be from allowed letters)
- Position 5: S (allowed: 2,5)

Option: O B A S ? – but we need 5 letters, so O B A S N → OBASN (but OBASN isn't a word)

Another: O N A S ? – ONAS? – not valid

Option: O B A S ? – OBAS? – no

Wait, let's think systematically:
We have:
O _ _ _ _
With A and S somewhere in positions 3,4,5 and 2,5 respectively.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2:
  O S _ A _
  Then A must be in 3,4,5
  But position 3 is already A, so:
  O S A _ _
  Need two more letters from allowed set (B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
  And avoid banned letters.

  Possible: O S A N D (OSAND? No)
  O S A N K (OSANK? No)
  O S A M B (OSAMB? No)

- If S is in position 5:
  O _ A _ S
  Then positions 2 and 4 need letters from allowed set.
  Possible: O B A N S (OBANS? No)
  O M A N S (OMANS? No)
  O P A N S (OPANS? No)
  O G A N S (OGANS? Yes! ""OGANS"" is a valid word)

Let's check OGANS:
- Starts with O (correct)
- Contains A (position 3, allowed) and S (position 5, allowed)
- No banned letters (R,E,T,I,C,L,Y)
- No duplicates of already known letters

This seems valid.

<guess>OGANS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: OASLY -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) S(-) L(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: OGANS -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) G(x) A(-) N(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on OGANS:
- O is correct at position 1 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- S is correct at position 5 (✓)

So we now know:
- Word starts with O and ends with S
- Must contain A somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are taken by O,G,N,S respectively)
- Letters not in the word: R,E,T,I,C,L,Y,G,N
- Available letters: B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Position constraints:
- A must be in position 2 or 4
- Position 3 is not A (from AROSE and OGANS feedback)
- Position 4 is not N (from OGANS) and must be A or another letter
- Position 2 or 4 for A

Let's explore possibilities:

Option 1: A in position 2
O A _ _ S
Then position 3 must be from remaining allowed letters (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
But A is already in position 2, so position 3 can be any allowed letter.

Possible words:
- O A B _ S → OAB_S → OABAS (invalid, not a word)
- O A M _ S → OAM_S → OAMBS (invalid)
- O A F _ S → OAF_S → OAFES (invalid, has E)
- O A D _ S → OAD_S → OADS (invalid, 4 letters)
- O A P _ S → OAP_S → OAPED (invalid, has E)
- O A H _ S → OA_H_S → OA_H_S → OAKEY (invalid, has E,Y)
- O A V _ S → OAV_S → OAVES (invalid, has E)
- O A W _ S → OAW_S → OAWNS (invalid, has N)
- O A K _ S → OAK_S → OAKED (invalid, has E)
- O A M _ S → OAM_S → OAMBS (invalid)
- O A D _ S → OAD_S → OADS (invalid)

Option 2: A in position 4
O _ _ A S
Then positions 2 and 3 must be from allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- O B D A S (OBDAS? No)
- O B M A S (OBMAS? No)
- O D M A S (ODMAS? No)
- O F M A S (OFMAS? No)
- O B A S S – but S is already at 5
- O M B A S (OMBAS? No)
- O P M A S (OPMAS? No)
- O V M A S (OVMAS? No)
- O W M A S (OWMAS? No)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Wait, let's try:
O B A S S – but this has S twice, and we know S is only at position 5. Also, A would be at position 3, but from AROSE and OGANS, A cannot be at 3 (AROSE had A at 1 and feedback said -, meaning A is in word but not 1; OGANS had A at 3 and feedback was -). So A cannot be at 3. So A must be at 2 or 4.

But in OGANS, A was at 3 and got -, so A is not at 3. Therefore A must be at 2 or 4.

So possible:
- O A _ _ S
- O _ _ A S

Let's explore O _ _ A S:
Positions 2 and 3 must be from allowed letters (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
Possible:
- O B D A S (OBDAS? No)
- O B M A S (OBMAS? No)
- O D M A S (ODMAS? No)
- O F M A S (OFMAS? No)
- O M B A S (OMBAS? No)
- O P M A S (OPMAS? No)
- O V M A S (OVMAS? No)
- O W M A S (OWMAS? No)

None seem valid. Let me re-examine allowed letters.

Wait, let's try:
O B A S S – but this has S twice, and we know S is at 5. Also, A would be at 3, but A cannot be at 3 (from AROSE and OGANS feedback). So this is invalid.

Let me list possible words systematically:
Valid English words starting with O, ending with S, containing A, no banned letters:
- OASPS – but has P,S and A at 2, but S is at 5, so OASPS would be O A S P S – but S is already at 5, so this would be O A S P S. Check:
  - O at 1 ✓
  - A at 2 (allowed)
  - S at 3 (allowed – S only banned at 1,4)
  - P at 4 (allowed)
  - S at 5 ✓
  - No banned letters
  - OASPS is a valid word!

Let me verify:
- OASPS: O(✓), A(-) but wait, A is at 2 (allowed), S at 3 (allowed), P at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (correct). This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: OAMPS – but M and P are allowed, but this is not a common word.

OASPS seems the most plausible valid word.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- O is fixed at position 1
- S is fixed at position 5
- A must be present, but cannot be at positions 1,3,5 (from earlier feedback)
- Therefore A must be at position 2 or 4
- The remaining letters must come from the allowed set (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)

The only valid English word fitting these constraints is OASPS.

So this is invalid.\n\nLet me list possible words systematically:\nValid English words starting with O, ending with S, containing A, no banned letters:\n- OASPS – but has P,S and A at 2, but S is at 5, so OASPS would be O A S P S – but S is already at 5, so this would be O A S P S. Check:\n  - O at 1 ✓\n  - A at 2 (allowed)\n  - S at 3 (allowed – S only banned at 1,4)\n  - P at 4 (allowed)\n  - S at 5 ✓\n  - No banned letters\n  - OASPS is a valid word!\n\nLet me verify:\n- OASPS: O(✓), A(-) but wait, A is at 2 (allowed), S at 3 (allowed), P at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (correct). This fits all constraints.\n\nAnother candidate: OAMPS – but M and P are allowed, but this is not a common word.\n\nOASPS seems the most plausible valid word.Based on the feedback, we now know:\n- O is fixed at position 1\n- S is fixed at position 5\n- A must be present, but cannot be at positions 1,3,5 (from earlier feedback)\n- Therefore A must be at position 2 or 4\n- The remaining letters must come from the allowed set (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)\n\nThe only valid English word fitting these constraints is OASPS.\n\n<guess>OASPS</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)\nGuess 3: OASLY -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) S(-) L(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: OGANS -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) G(x) A(-) N(x) S(✓)\nGuess 5: OASPS -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) S(-) P(-) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the new feedback on OASPS:
- O is correct at 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but not at 2 (-)
- S is in the word but not at 3 (-)
- P is in the word but not at 4 (-)
- S is correct at 5 (✓)

So we now have:
O _ _ _ S
with A, P, and S (already at 5) present, and S is only at 5, so the other S is not needed.

Positions:
- A must be at 4 (only remaining spot for A)
- P must be at 2 or 3
- Positions 2 and 3 must be from allowed letters (B,D,F,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z), avoiding the banned letters.

Possible:
- O P A _ S → OPA_S → need two letters. Valid word: OPALS (but L is banned), OPASH (not a word), OPAST (T banned)
- O _ P A S → _ P A _ S → need letter at 2
  - O B P A S (OBPAS? No)
  - O D P A S (ODPAS? No)
  - O F P A S (OFPAS? No)
  - O M P A S (OMPAS? No)
  - O V P A S (OVPAS? No)
  - O W P A S (OWPAS? No)

Wait, let's think of actual valid 5-letter words:
- O P A S S – but S is already at 5, and we have S at 5 already, so this would be O P A S S – but the word is O P A S S, which is valid!

Check constraints:
- O at 1 ✓
- P is in the word and not at 4 (here P is at 2, allowed)
- A is in the word and must be at 4 (only spot left), so A at 4
- S at 5 ✓
- No banned letters (R,E,T,I,C,L,Y,G,N)
- Letters used: O,P,A,S – all allowed.

This fits perfectly.
