### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct or wrong positions, which will help narrow down future guesses.

- Uses S and E in new positions (positions 3 and 5)
- Doesn't use R or O
- Uses new letters B to test for inclusion

Another candidate is ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A
- Uses S in position 2 (new position)
- Uses E in position 4 (new position)

This seems good because it tests new positions for S and E while introducing new letters.

- It tests E in position 5 (which is common)
- It tests S in position 3 (also common)
- It uses B and E (both common letters)

   - A is fixed in position 1.

   - S is somewhere, but not position 4.

2. ABASE → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - B is not in the word.
   - The second A got “-”, so there is no second A.
   - S is still somewhere, but not position 4 (from AROSE) and not position 3 (from ABASE). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - E is still somewhere, but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

3: possible E or S
4: neither S nor E (from ABASE feedback)
5: possible S or E

We need two more letters that are not R, O, or B. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

A common word fitting A S E _ _ is “ASEPT” – but P and T are both possible. However, “ASEPT” is not super common.

Another common word: “ASIDE” – but we already saw D is still possible, and we haven’t ruled out I either.

But let’s check: ASIDE uses I and D, neither of which has been ruled out. And:
- A(✓) S in position 2 (new), E in position 3 (new), I and D new.

This seems valid.

However, “ASIDE” might be too obvious. Another option: “ASENS” – but that repeats S. 

Another candidate: “ASKEE” – but K and E are fine, but E is already in position 3.

Actually, let’s try “ASIDE” first as it’s common and fits the constraints.

But wait, in ABASE, E was position 4 and got “-”, so E cannot be in position 4. In ASIDE, E is in position 3 – that’s fine.

- Uses new letters B to test for inclusion

But wait, ""ABASE"" uses B which we haven't tested yet - that's fine. However, let me think if there's a better option. 

Another candidate is ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A
- Uses S in position 2 (new position)
- Uses E in position 4 (new position)
- Uses I and D (new letters)

This seems good because it tests new positions for S and E while introducing new letters.

However, ""ABASE"" is actually better because:
- It tests E in position 5 (which is common)
- It tests S in position 3 (also common)
- It uses B and E (both common letters)

I think ""ABASE"" is a strong second guess.

Guess 2: ABASE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - R and O are not in the word.
   - S is somewhere, but not position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not position 5.

2. ABASE → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - B is not in the word.
   - The second A got “-”, so there is no second A.
   - S is still somewhere, but not position 4 (from AROSE) and not position 3 (from ABASE). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - E is still somewhere, but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Letters we know:
- Present: A (position 1), S, E
- Absent: R, O, B

Positions so far:
1: A
2: possible S or E
3: possible E or S
4: neither S nor E (from ABASE feedback)
5: possible S or E

But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE), and S cannot be in position 4 or 3 (from ABASE and AROSE). So:
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 2 or 3

Let’s test S in position 2 and E in position 3:
Word form: A S E _ _

We need two more letters that are not R, O, or B. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

A common word fitting A S E _ _ is “ASEPT” – but P and T are both possible. However, “ASEPT” is not super common.

Another common word: “ASIDE” – but we already saw D is still possible, and we haven’t ruled out I either.

But let’s check: ASIDE uses I and D, neither of which has been ruled out. And:
- A(✓) S in position 2 (new), E in position 3 (new), I and D new.

This seems valid.

However, “ASIDE” might be too obvious. Another option: “ASENS” – but that repeats S. 

Another candidate: “ASKEE” – but K and E are fine, but E is already in position 3.

Actually, let’s try “ASIDE” first as it’s common and fits the constraints.

But wait, in ABASE, E was position 4 and got “-”, so E cannot be in position 4. In ASIDE, E is in position 3 – that’s fine. 

But let me think of a more common word: “ASIDE” is decent.

Another: “ASHEN” – but H and N are new. 

But “ASIDE” seems better.

Actually, let me try “ASIDE” now.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters in the word:
- A (fixed in position 1)
- S (somewhere, not positions 3 or 4)
- E (somewhere, not positions 4 or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
R, O, B, I, D

Positions ruled out for S and E:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from ABASE and ASIDE).
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and ABASE).

So possible positions:
S: 2 or 5
E: 2 or 3

Word structure so far:
A _ _ _ _
With S and E occupying two of positions 2, 3, 5.

Let’s enumerate possible (S, E) combinations:

1. S in 2, E in 3 → A S E _ _
   Need two more letters not in {R, O, B, I, D}. Common: C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.
   Possible common word: A S E _ _ → “ASEPT” (not common) or “ASERT” (but T is allowed). Actually, “ASEPT” is obscure.

2. S in 2, E in 5 → A S _ _ E
   Need two letters. Common: A S _ _ E → “ASKEE” (invalid) or “ASHEE” (invalid).

3. S in 5, E in 2 → A E _ _ S
   Common word: A E _ _ S → “AEONS” (but O is out), “AEGIS” (too long), “AEGOS” (O out).

4. S in 5, E in 3 → A _ E _ S
   Common word: A _ E _ S → “ABEES” (B out), “ADEPS” (D out).

Only viable candidate that seems common and fits the constraints is “ASIDE”:
- A(✓) S in 2 (new), I in 3 (but I is ruled out) – wait, no: I is ruled out, but we haven’t ruled out side letters.

Wait, let’s check “ASIDE” carefully:
- A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(-)
  - A is correct.
  - S is in word but not position 2 (from ASIDE) and not position 4 (from ABASE) and not position 3 (from ASIDE). So S must be in position 5.
  - E is in word but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE) and not position 5 (from ASIDE). So E must be in position 3.
  - I and D are not in the word.

So the structure is: A _ E _ S

“ANEWS”:

This fits all constraints.

Let me verify:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct or wrong positions, which will help narrow down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
3. It does NOT contain R or O

I need a word that starts with A, uses S and E in different positions, and avoids R and O. Let me think of possibilities:

- A _ _ S E
- A _ S E _
- A _ _ E S
- A S _ _ E
- A E _ _ S
- etc.

A good candidate is ""ABASE"":
- Starts with A (correct)
- Uses S and E in new positions (positions 3 and 5)
- Doesn't use R or O
- Uses new letters B to test for inclusion

But wait, ""ABASE"" uses B which we haven't tested yet - that's fine. However, let me think if there's a better option. 

Another candidate is ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A
- Uses S in position 2 (new position)
- Uses E in position 4 (new position)
- Uses I and D (new letters)

This seems good because it tests new positions for S and E while introducing new letters.

However, ""ABASE"" is actually better because:
- It tests E in position 5 (which is common)
- It tests S in position 3 (also common)
- It uses B and E (both common letters)

I think ""ABASE"" is a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - R and O are not in the word.
   - S is somewhere, but not position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not position 5.

2. ABASE → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - B is not in the word.
   - The second A got “-”, so there is no second A.
   - S is still somewhere, but not position 4 (from AROSE) and not position 3 (from ABASE). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - E is still somewhere, but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Letters we know:
- Present: A (position 1), S, E
- Absent: R, O, B

Positions so far:
1: A
2: possible S or E
3: possible E or S
4: neither S nor E (from ABASE feedback)
5: possible S or E

But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE), and S cannot be in position 4 or 3 (from ABASE and AROSE). So:
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 2 or 3

Let’s test S in position 2 and E in position 3:
Word form: A S E _ _

We need two more letters that are not R, O, or B. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

A common word fitting A S E _ _ is “ASEPT” – but P and T are both possible. However, “ASEPT” is not super common.

Another common word: “ASIDE” – but we already saw D is still possible, and we haven’t ruled out I either.

But let’s check: ASIDE uses I and D, neither of which has been ruled out. And:
- A(✓) S in position 2 (new), E in position 3 (new), I and D new.

This seems valid.

However, “ASIDE” might be too obvious. Another option: “ASENS” – but that repeats S. 

Another candidate: “ASKEE” – but K and E are fine, but E is already in position 3.

Actually, let’s try “ASIDE” first as it’s common and fits the constraints.

But wait, in ABASE, E was position 4 and got “-”, so E cannot be in position 4. In ASIDE, E is in position 3 – that’s fine. 

But let me think of a more common word: “ASIDE” is decent.

Another: “ASHEN” – but H and N are new. 

But “ASIDE” seems better.

- A (fixed in position 1)
- S (somewhere, not positions 3 or 4)
- E (somewhere, not positions 4 or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:

Positions ruled out for S and E:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from ABASE and ASIDE).
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and ABASE).

So possible positions:

   Need two more letters not in {R, O, B, I, D}. Common: C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.
   Possible common word: A S E _ _ → “ASEPT” (not common) or “ASERT” (but T is allowed). Actually, “ASEPT” is obscure.

2. S in 2, E in 5 → A S _ _ E
   Need two letters. Common: A S _ _ E → “ASKEE” (invalid) or “ASHEE” (invalid).

3. S in 5, E in 2 → A E _ _ S
   Common word: A E _ _ S → “AEONS” (but O is out), “AEGIS” (too long), “AEGOS” (O out).

4. S in 5, E in 3 → A _ E _ S
   Common word: A _ E _ S → “ABEES” (B out), “ADEPS” (D out).

Only viable candidate that seems common and fits the constraints is “ASIDE”:
- A(✓) S in 2 (new), I in 3 (but I is ruled out) – wait, no: I is ruled out, but we haven’t ruled out side letters.

Wait, let’s check “ASIDE” carefully:
- A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(-)
  - A is correct.
  - S is in word but not position 2 (from ASIDE) and not position 4 (from ABASE) and not position 3 (from ASIDE). So S must be in position 5.
  - E is in word but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE) and not position 5 (from ASIDE). So E must be in position 3.
  - I and D are not in the word.

So the structure is: A _ E _ S

Letters left to use: common consonants not yet ruled out. Let’s pick “L” and “M”:

“AMELS” – not a word.

“ALEMS” – not a word.

“ALEMS” – not a word.

“AMELS” – not a word.

“APEMS” – not a word.

“ATEMS” – not a word.

“AWEMS” – not a word.

“AYEMS” – not a word.

Hmm, let’s try “ASHE” + S, but we need 5 letters.

Wait, the pattern is A _ E _ S.

Common word fitting this: “ABEES” – but B is out.

“AEONS” – O is out.

“AEGIS” – too long.

“AEMIS” – not a word.

“AENOS” – not a word.

“AEGPS” – not a word.

“AEONS” – already saw O is out.

“AEMIS” – no.

“AEST S” – no.

Wait, let’s list all possible A _ E _ S words without R, O, B, I, D:

- A M E L S – “AMELS” (not a word)
- A M E N S – “AMENS” (not a word)
- A L E N S – “ALENS” (not a word)
- A L E T S – “ALETS” (not a word)
- A N E L S – “ANELS” (not a word)
- A N E T S – “ANEWS” but W is allowed. Actually “ANEWS” is valid.

“ANEWS”:
- A(✓) N E W S
- N, W not yet ruled out.
- S is in position 5 – allowed.
- E is in position 3 – allowed.

This fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) N E W S
  - A is correct.
  - S is in position 5 (new).
  - E is in position 3 (new).
  - N and W are new letters not yet tested.
  - No R, O, B, I, D.

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct or wrong positions, which will help narrow down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
3. It does NOT contain R or O

I need a word that starts with A, uses S and E in different positions, and avoids R and O. Let me think of possibilities:

- A _ _ S E
- A _ S E _
- A _ _ E S
- A S _ _ E
- A E _ _ S
- etc.

A good candidate is ""ABASE"":
- Starts with A (correct)
- Uses S and E in new positions (positions 3 and 5)
- Doesn't use R or O
- Uses new letters B to test for inclusion

But wait, ""ABASE"" uses B which we haven't tested yet - that's fine. However, let me think if there's a better option. 

Another candidate is ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A
- Uses S in position 2 (new position)
- Uses E in position 4 (new position)
- Uses I and D (new letters)

This seems good because it tests new positions for S and E while introducing new letters.

However, ""ABASE"" is actually better because:
- It tests E in position 5 (which is common)
- It tests S in position 3 (also common)
- It uses B and E (both common letters)

I think ""ABASE"" is a strong second guess.

Guess 2: ABASE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - R and O are not in the word.
   - S is somewhere, but not position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not position 5.

2. ABASE → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - B is not in the word.
   - The second A got “-”, so there is no second A.
   - S is still somewhere, but not position 4 (from AROSE) and not position 3 (from ABASE). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - E is still somewhere, but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Letters we know:
- Present: A (position 1), S, E
- Absent: R, O, B

Positions so far:
1: A
2: possible S or E
3: possible E or S
4: neither S nor E (from ABASE feedback)
5: possible S or E

But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE), and S cannot be in position 4 or 3 (from ABASE and AROSE). So:
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 2 or 3

Let’s test S in position 2 and E in position 3:
Word form: A S E _ _

We need two more letters that are not R, O, or B. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

A common word fitting A S E _ _ is “ASEPT” – but P and T are both possible. However, “ASEPT” is not super common.

Another common word: “ASIDE” – but we already saw D is still possible, and we haven’t ruled out I either.

But let’s check: ASIDE uses I and D, neither of which has been ruled out. And:
- A(✓) S in position 2 (new), E in position 3 (new), I and D new.

This seems valid.

However, “ASIDE” might be too obvious. Another option: “ASENS” – but that repeats S. 

Another candidate: “ASKEE” – but K and E are fine, but E is already in position 3.

Actually, let’s try “ASIDE” first as it’s common and fits the constraints.

But wait, in ABASE, E was position 4 and got “-”, so E cannot be in position 4. In ASIDE, E is in position 3 – that’s fine. 

But let me think of a more common word: “ASIDE” is decent.

Another: “ASHEN” – but H and N are new. 

But “ASIDE” seems better.

Actually, let me try “ASIDE” now.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters in the word:
- A (fixed in position 1)
- S (somewhere, not positions 3 or 4)
- E (somewhere, not positions 4 or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
R, O, B, I, D

Positions ruled out for S and E:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from ABASE and ASIDE).
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and ABASE).

So possible positions:
S: 2 or 5
E: 2 or 3

Word structure so far:
A _ _ _ _
With S and E occupying two of positions 2, 3, 5.

Let’s enumerate possible (S, E) combinations:

1. S in 2, E in 3 → A S E _ _
   Need two more letters not in {R, O, B, I, D}. Common: C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.
   Possible common word: A S E _ _ → “ASEPT” (not common) or “ASERT” (but T is allowed). Actually, “ASEPT” is obscure.

2. S in 2, E in 5 → A S _ _ E
   Need two letters. Common: A S _ _ E → “ASKEE” (invalid) or “ASHEE” (invalid).

3. S in 5, E in 2 → A E _ _ S
   Common word: A E _ _ S → “AEONS” (but O is out), “AEGIS” (too long), “AEGOS” (O out).

4. S in 5, E in 3 → A _ E _ S
   Common word: A _ E _ S → “ABEES” (B out), “ADEPS” (D out).

Only viable candidate that seems common and fits the constraints is “ASIDE”:
- A(✓) S in 2 (new), I in 3 (but I is ruled out) – wait, no: I is ruled out, but we haven’t ruled out side letters.

Wait, let’s check “ASIDE” carefully:
- A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(-)
  - A is correct.
  - S is in word but not position 2 (from ASIDE) and not position 4 (from ABASE) and not position 3 (from ASIDE). So S must be in position 5.
  - E is in word but not position 5 (from AROSE) and not position 4 (from ABASE) and not position 5 (from ASIDE). So E must be in position 3.
  - I and D are not in the word.

So the structure is: A _ E _ S

Letters left to use: common consonants not yet ruled out. Let’s pick “L” and “M”:

“AMELS” – not a word.

“ALEMS” – not a word.

“ALEMS” – not a word.

“AMELS” – not a word.

“APEMS” – not a word.

“ATEMS” – not a word.

“AWEMS” – not a word.

“AYEMS” – not a word.

Hmm, let’s try “ASHE” + S, but we need 5 letters.

Wait, the pattern is A _ E _ S.

Common word fitting this: “ABEES” – but B is out.

“AEONS” – O is out.

“AEGIS” – too long.

“AEMIS” – not a word.

“AENOS” – not a word.

“AEGPS” – not a word.

“AEONS” – already saw O is out.

“AEMIS” – no.

“AEST S” – no.

Wait, let’s list all possible A _ E _ S words without R, O, B, I, D:

- A M E L S – “AMELS” (not a word)
- A M E N S – “AMENS” (not a word)
- A L E N S – “ALENS” (not a word)
- A L E T S – “ALETS” (not a word)
- A N E L S – “ANELS” (not a word)
- A N E T S – “ANEWS” but W is allowed. Actually “ANEWS” is valid.

“ANEWS”:
- A(✓) N E W S
- N, W not yet ruled out.
- S is in position 5 – allowed.
- E is in position 3 – allowed.

This fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) N E W S
  - A is correct.
  - S is in position 5 (new).
  - E is in position 3 (new).
  - N and W are new letters not yet tested.
  - No R, O, B, I, D.

This seems valid.

From the new feedback on ANEWS:
- A(✓) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)

This tells us:
1. A is correct in position 1.
2. E is correct in position 3.
3. S is correct in position 5.
4. N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so N must be in position 2, 4).
5. W is not in the word.

So far we have:
A _ E _ S
With N somewhere in positions 2, 4.

Possible letters left (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, Y, etc.

Let’s list possible words fitting A _ E _ S with N in 2 or 4:

Case 1: N in position 2 → A N E _ S
Need a letter for position 4 that is not R, O, B, I, D, W.
Possible: A N E L S (ANELS – not a word), A N E M S (ANEMS – not a word), A N E T S (ANETS – not a word).

Case 2: N in position 4 → A _ E N S
Need a letter for position 2 that is not R, O, B, I, D, W.
Possible: A C E N S (ACENS – not a word), A F E N S (AFENS – not a word), A M E N S (AMENS – not a word), A P E N S (APENS – not a word), A T E N S (ATENS – not a word).

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. Let me think of actual English words fitting A _ E _ S with N in 2 or 4.

For A N E _ S:
- ANGEL – but L is allowed, G is allowed.
Check constraints:
- A(✓) N(-) E(✓) G E(✓) L S(✓)
- N is in position 2 (from ANEWS feedback it was in wrong position, so position 2 is now valid for N).
- G and L are new letters not yet tested.
- No R, O, B, I, D, W.

“ANGEL” fits perfectly.

For A _ E N S:
No common words come to mind.

So the only valid candidate is “ANGEL”.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) N(-) E(✓) G(-) L(-) S(✓)
- A, E, S are correctly placed.
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in wrong position before).
- G and L are new letters.

This seems correct.

From the new feedback on ANGEL:
- A(✓) N(-) G(x) E(-) L(x)

This tells us:
1. A is correct in position 1.
2. E is correct in position 3.
3. S is correct in position 5.
4. N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so N must be in position 4).
5. G and L are not in the word.

So the word must be:
A _ E N S

We still need a letter for position 2. Letters not yet ruled out (and not already used A, E, N, S):
C, F, H, M, P, T, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter words fitting A _ E N S:
- A C E N S → “ACENS” – not a word
- A F E N S → “AFENS” – not a word
- A H E N S → “AHEN S” – not a word
- A M E N S → “AMENS” – not a word
- A P E N S → “APENS” – not a word
- A T E N S → “ATENS” – not a word
- A Y E N S → “AYENS” – not a word

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words. The only common English word that fits the pattern A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is ruled out. 

Actually, let me check “ACENS” – no. “AFENS” – no. 

But “ACORN” – no, O and R out.

“ADENS” – D out.

“AEONS” – O and S issues.

“AGENS” – G out.

“AHENS” – not a word.

“AMENS” – not a word.

“APENS” – not a word.

“ATENS” – not a word.

“AYENS” – not a word.

Let me step back. The only valid word that fits A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is out. 

Wait, let me check “ACORN” – no, O and R.

“ACEDS” – not a word.

“ACENS” – not a word.

“ACMPS” – no.

Actually, the only valid word that fits A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is out.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

We have:
A _ E N S

Letters used so far:
A, E, N, S

Letters ruled out: R, O, B, I, D, W, G, L

So position 2 must be a letter not in that set.

Common letters left: C, F, H, M, P, T, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- A C E N S – not a word
- A F E N S – not a word
- A H E N S – not a word
- A M E N S – not a word
- A P E N S – not a word
- A T E N S – not a word
- A Y E N S – not a word

But wait, let me check “ACORN” – no, O and R.

Actually, the only valid word that fits A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is out.

This suggests I might have made an error in deducing N must be in position 4. Let me re-examine:

From ANEWS feedback: N was in position 2 and got “-”, so N is in the word but not in position 2. From ANGEL feedback: N was in position 2 again and got “-”, so N is not in position 2. 

Therefore, N must be in position 4.

But no common word fits A _ E N S. This implies my assumption that N must be in position 4 is correct, yet there is no valid word. This suggests either:
1. I made a mistake in deducing N must be in position 4.
2. There is a valid word that fits A _ E N S that I am missing.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

From ANEWS: N was in position 2 and got “-”.
From ANGEL: N was in position 2 again and got “-”.

Thus N is in the word but NOT in position 2. From earlier:
- Not in position 3 (from ASIDE)
- Not in position 4 (from ABASE)
- Not in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Not in position 1 (from ABASE)

Thus N must be in position 2 or 3. But from ANEWS and ANGEL, N was in position 2 and got “-”, so N is NOT in position 2. Therefore, N must be in position 3.

So the word must be:
A _ E N S

But position 2 must be a letter not yet ruled out. Valid words:
- A C E N S – not valid
- A F E N S – not valid
- A H E N S – not valid
- A M E N S – not valid
- A P E N S – not valid
- A T E N S – not valid
- A Y E N S – not valid

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From ANEWS: N was in position 2 and got “-”, so N is in the word but not in position 2.
From ANGEL: N was in position 2 again and got “-”, confirming N is not in position 2.

Thus N must be in position 3 or 4.

From ABASE: N was in position 3 and got “-”, so N is not in position 3.

Thus N must be in position 4.

So the word must be:
A _ E N S

But no valid 5-letter word fits A _ E N S. This implies my deduction that N must be in position 4 is correct, yet there is no valid word. This suggests the word must be “ACORN” – but O and R are out.

This indicates I might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

The word must be A _ E N S. The only possible letter for position 2 is a consonant not yet ruled out. But no common word fits.

Wait, let me check “AMENS” – but M is allowed.

“AMENS” is a valid word (plural of “amen”).

Let me verify:
- A(✓) M(-) E(✓) N(-) S(✓)
- M is new, N is in the word but not in position 4 (from ANEWS), so N in position 3 is allowed.

This fits perfectly.

Thus the word must be “AMENS”.

But let me check: A M E N S
- A(✓) M(-) E(✓) N(-) S(✓)
- M is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 4 (new)
- All constraints satisfied.

This seems correct.

<guess>AMENS</guess>",AMENS,"From the new feedback on ANGEL:
- A(✓) N(-) G(x) E(-) L(x)

This tells us:
1. A is correct in position 1.
2. E is correct in position 3.
3. S is correct in position 5.
4. N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so N must be in position 4).
5. G and L are not in the word.

So the word must be:
A _ E N S

We still need a letter for position 2. Letters not yet ruled out (and not already used A, E, N, S):
C, F, H, M, P, T, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter words fitting A _ E N S:
- A C E N S → “ACENS” – not a word
- A F E N S → “AFENS” – not a word
- A H E N S → “AHEN S” – not a word
- A M E N S → “AMENS” – not a word
- A P E N S → “APENS” – not a word
- A T E N S → “ATENS” – not a word
- A Y E N S → “AYENS” – not a word

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words. The only common English word that fits the pattern A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is ruled out. 

Actually, let me check “ACENS” – no. “AFENS” – no. 

But “ACORN” – no, O and R out.

“ADENS” – D out.

“AEONS” – O and S issues.

“AGENS” – G out.

“AHENS” – not a word.

“AMENS” – not a word.

“APENS” – not a word.

“ATENS” – not a word.

“AYENS” – not a word.

Let me step back. The only valid word that fits A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is out. 

Wait, let me check “ACORN” – no, O and R.

“ACEDS” – not a word.

“ACENS” – not a word.

“ACMPS” – no.

Actually, the only valid word that fits A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is out.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

We have:
A _ E N S

Letters used so far:
A, E, N, S

Letters ruled out: R, O, B, I, D, W, G, L

So position 2 must be a letter not in that set.

Common letters left: C, F, H, M, P, T, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- A C E N S – not a word
- A F E N S – not a word
- A H E N S – not a word
- A M E N S – not a word
- A P E N S – not a word
- A T E N S – not a word
- A Y E N S – not a word

But wait, let me check “ACORN” – no, O and R.

Actually, the only valid word that fits A _ E N S is “ABENS” – but B is out.

This suggests I might have made an error in deducing N must be in position 4. Let me re-examine:

From ANEWS feedback: N was in position 2 and got “-”, so N is in the word but not in position 2. From ANGEL feedback: N was in position 2 again and got “-”, so N is not in position 2. 

Therefore, N must be in position 4.

But no common word fits A _ E N S. This implies my assumption that N must be in position 4 is correct, yet there is no valid word. This suggests either:
1. I made a mistake in deducing N must be in position 4.
2. There is a valid word that fits A _ E N S that I am missing.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

From ANEWS: N was in position 2 and got “-”.
From ANGEL: N was in position 2 again and got “-”.

Thus N is in the word but NOT in position 2. From earlier:
- Not in position 3 (from ASIDE)
- Not in position 4 (from ABASE)
- Not in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Not in position 1 (from ABASE)

Thus N must be in position 2 or 3. But from ANEWS and ANGEL, N was in position 2 and got “-”, so N is NOT in position 2. Therefore, N must be in position 3.

So the word must be:
A _ E N S

But position 2 must be a letter not yet ruled out. Valid words:
- A C E N S – not valid
- A F E N S – not valid
- A H E N S – not valid
- A M E N S – not valid
- A P E N S – not valid
- A T E N S – not valid
- A Y E N S – not valid

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From ANEWS: N was in position 2 and got “-”, so N is in the word but not in position 2.
From ANGEL: N was in position 2 again and got “-”, confirming N is not in position 2.

Thus N must be in position 3 or 4.

From ABASE: N was in position 3 and got “-”, so N is not in position 3.

Thus N must be in position 4.

So the word must be:
A _ E N S

But no valid 5-letter word fits A _ E N S. This implies my deduction that N must be in position 4 is correct, yet there is no valid word. This suggests the word must be “ACORN” – but O and R are out.

This indicates I might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

The word must be A _ E N S. The only possible letter for position 2 is a consonant not yet ruled out. But no common word fits.

Wait, let me check “AMENS” – but M is allowed.

“AMENS” is a valid word (plural of “amen”).

Let me verify:
- A(✓) M(-) E(✓) N(-) S(✓)
- M is new, N is in the word but not in position 4 (from ANEWS), so N in position 3 is allowed.

This fits perfectly.

Thus the word must be “AMENS”.

But let me check: A M E N S
- A(✓) M(-) E(✓) N(-) S(✓)
- M is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 4 (new)
- All constraints satisfied.

This seems correct.",Guess 6: AMENS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓),FAIL
