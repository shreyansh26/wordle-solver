- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
2. Does not use A or R at all.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from their previous guesses.

Good candidates would shuffle O, S, E into new positions and fill the remaining two slots with other letters (not A or R). A simple next guess is “SPOKE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4 before).
- P and K are new letters (not A or R).
- O moves to position 2 (was 3 before).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5 before – oops, that’s the same position! Let me pick again.)

Let me try “POSED”:
- P and D are new letters.
- O in position 2 (was 3 – still not ideal.)

Better: “SOBER” – but it has two R’s (no, it has B and E, but R is forbidden).

“SLOPE”:
- S in 1 (was 4), L new, O in 2 (was 3), P new, E in 5 (was 5 – still bad).

“SHEET”:
- S in 1, H new, E in 2, E in 3 (but we can only have one E?), T new.

Actually, let’s try “SPOKE” again with E in 4 instead of 5: “SPOKE” has E in 4 (was 5 before), but K is new, P new.

Wait, simpler: “SPOKE” has O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 4 (was 5). That’s all good.

But let me pick a word that also tests new consonants. “SPOKE” uses P and K, which are both new and not forbidden.

Alternatively, “SWEET” – but that has two E’s and a T, with O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 3 (was 5), W new, T new.

But “SPOKE” seems more balanced.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE → S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, P, K
- Letters definitely IN the word (but positions still unknown): O, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E exactly once each, does NOT contain A, R, P, K, and has none of O, S, E in their previous guess positions.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SPOKE)
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SPOKE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from SPOKE)

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have three required letters). We can pick any letter not yet used and not forbidden. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

A simple word that satisfies these: “SHEET”
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from SPOKE feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “DOSES” – but it has two S’s and a D, and we only know one S exists. Also, D is new.

Try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s and a H, and we only know one O exists. Also, U is new.

Wait, we need exactly one O, one S, one E.

Let’s try “SLOPE” – but O is in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“SPOOF” – has P (forbidden).

“SWEET” – has two E’s.

“SLEET” – has two E’s.

“SMILE” – has I new, L new, M new, but O is missing.

We need O, S, E.

Let me list possible positions:
If O is in 1: O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 2,3,4

Try O in 1, S in 2, E in 4: O S _ E _
Need two more letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I, etc.

“OSITE” – but I and T are new, but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), I in 3, T in 4, E in 5 (but E cannot be in 5). So invalid.

“OSBEN” – but N is new, B new, but E is in 4 (ok), but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), B in 3, N in 5. But E is in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed). But we have two letters left to determine – we need to test new letters.

But we have only 3 required letters (O, S, E) and the word must be 5 letters, so we need two more letters. The best approach is to pick a word that uses O, S, E exactly once each, and introduces new letters.

Let me try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s, which is invalid (we know only one O exists).

“LOUSE” – has U new, L new, O in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

“COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“FOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“HOUSE” – same issue.

“DOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“LOUSE” – same.

“HOUSE” – same.

This is tricky. Let me try O in 4: _ _ _ O _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 1,2,3

Try S in 2, E in 1: E S _ O _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – but not a valid word.

“ENOS” – invalid.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

Wait, let me think of valid 5-letter words with O, S, E exactly once each, avoiding A,R,P,K.

Valid words:
- “HOUSE” – has two O’s (invalid)
- “LOUSE” – has U new, but O in 2 (forbidden)
- “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden)
- “COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)
- “BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)

Hmm, seems like many common words have two O’s or O in 2/3. Let me try O in 5: _ _ _ _ O
Then S must be in 2,3
E must be in 1,2,3,4

Try E in 1, S in 2, O in 5: E S _ _ O
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESINO” – not a word.

“ESITO” – not a word.

“ESCOL” – not a word.

“ESDON” – not a word.

“ESMON” – not a word.

“ESON” – too short.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESSEX” – has X new, but O in 4 (ok), S in 1 (forbidden in SPOKE), E in 2 (ok), X in 3, E in 5 (forbidden).

“ESSEX” – S in 1 (forbidden).

“ESSE” – too short.

“ESSET” – too long.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

Let me try O in 1, S in 3, E in 4: O _ S E _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“OSTEN” – not a word.

“ONSET” – has T new, N new, but O in 1 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), T in 2, N in 5. This looks valid.

“ONSET”:
- O: position 1 (allowed, previous was 3)
- N: new letter
- S: position 3 (allowed, previous was 4)
- E: position 4 (allowed, previous was 5)
- T: new letter

This seems valid and tests two new letters (N, T).

Let me check:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, P, K.
- Positions of O, S, E are different from previous guesses.

Yes, “ONSET” is a valid guess.
</think>

<guess>ONSET</guess>",ONSET,"From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE → S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, P, K
- Letters definitely IN the word (but positions still unknown): O, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E exactly once each, does NOT contain A, R, P, K, and has none of O, S, E in their previous guess positions.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SPOKE)
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SPOKE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from SPOKE)

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have three required letters). We can pick any letter not yet used and not forbidden. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

A simple word that satisfies these: “SHEET”
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from SPOKE feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “DOSES” – but it has two S’s and a D, and we only know one S exists. Also, D is new.

Try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s and a H, and we only know one O exists. Also, U is new.

Wait, we need exactly one O, one S, one E.

Let’s try “SLOPE” – but O is in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“SPOOF” – has P (forbidden).

“SWEET” – has two E’s.

“SLEET” – has two E’s.

“SMILE” – has I new, L new, M new, but O is missing.

We need O, S, E.

Let me list possible positions:
If O is in 1: O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 2,3,4

Try O in 1, S in 2, E in 4: O S _ E _
Need two more letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I, etc.

“OSITE” – but I and T are new, but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), I in 3, T in 4, E in 5 (but E cannot be in 5). So invalid.

“OSBEN” – but N is new, B new, but E is in 4 (ok), but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), B in 3, N in 5. But E is in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed). But we have two letters left to determine – we need to test new letters.

But we have only 3 required letters (O, S, E) and the word must be 5 letters, so we need two more letters. The best approach is to pick a word that uses O, S, E exactly once each, and introduces new letters.

Let me try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s, which is invalid (we know only one O exists).

“LOUSE” – has U new, L new, O in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

“COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“FOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“HOUSE” – same issue.

“DOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“LOUSE” – same.

“HOUSE” – same.

This is tricky. Let me try O in 4: _ _ _ O _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 1,2,3

Try S in 2, E in 1: E S _ O _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – but not a valid word.

“ENOS” – invalid.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

Wait, let me think of valid 5-letter words with O, S, E exactly once each, avoiding A,R,P,K.

Valid words:
- “HOUSE” – has two O’s (invalid)
- “LOUSE” – has U new, but O in 2 (forbidden)
- “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden)
- “COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)
- “BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)

Hmm, seems like many common words have two O’s or O in 2/3. Let me try O in 5: _ _ _ _ O
Then S must be in 2,3
E must be in 1,2,3,4

Try E in 1, S in 2, O in 5: E S _ _ O
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ONSET” – has T new, N new, but O in 1 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), T in 2, N in 5. This looks valid.

“ONSET”:
- O: position 1 (allowed, previous was 3)
- N: new letter
- S: position 3 (allowed, previous was 4)
- E: position 4 (allowed, previous was 5)
- T: new letter

This seems valid and tests two new letters (N, T).

Let me check:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, P, K.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
2. Does not use A or R at all.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from their previous guesses.

Good candidates would shuffle O, S, E into new positions and fill the remaining two slots with other letters (not A or R). A simple next guess is “SPOKE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4 before).
- P and K are new letters (not A or R).
- O moves to position 2 (was 3 before).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5 before – oops, that’s the same position! Let me pick again.)

Let me try “POSED”:
- P and D are new letters.
- O in position 2 (was 3 – still not ideal.)

Better: “SOBER” – but it has two R’s (no, it has B and E, but R is forbidden).

“SLOPE”:
- S in 1 (was 4), L new, O in 2 (was 3), P new, E in 5 (was 5 – still bad).

“SHEET”:
- S in 1, H new, E in 2, E in 3 (but we can only have one E?), T new.

Actually, let’s try “SPOKE” again with E in 4 instead of 5: “SPOKE” has E in 4 (was 5 before), but K is new, P new.

Wait, simpler: “SPOKE” has O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 4 (was 5). That’s all good.

But let me pick a word that also tests new consonants. “SPOKE” uses P and K, which are both new and not forbidden.

Alternatively, “SWEET” – but that has two E’s and a T, with O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 3 (was 5), W new, T new.

But “SPOKE” seems more balanced.

Let me go with “SPOKE”.

<guess>SPOKE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE → S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, P, K
- Letters definitely IN the word (but positions still unknown): O, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E exactly once each, does NOT contain A, R, P, K, and has none of O, S, E in their previous guess positions.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SPOKE)
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SPOKE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from SPOKE)

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have three required letters). We can pick any letter not yet used and not forbidden. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

A simple word that satisfies these: “SHEET”
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from SPOKE feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “DOSES” – but it has two S’s and a D, and we only know one S exists. Also, D is new.

Try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s and a H, and we only know one O exists. Also, U is new.

Wait, we need exactly one O, one S, one E.

Let’s try “SLOPE” – but O is in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“SPOOF” – has P (forbidden).

“SWEET” – has two E’s.

“SLEET” – has two E’s.

“SMILE” – has I new, L new, M new, but O is missing.

We need O, S, E.

Let me list possible positions:
If O is in 1: O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 2,3,4

Try O in 1, S in 2, E in 4: O S _ E _
Need two more letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I, etc.

“OSITE” – but I and T are new, but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), I in 3, T in 4, E in 5 (but E cannot be in 5). So invalid.

“OSBEN” – but N is new, B new, but E is in 4 (ok), but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), B in 3, N in 5. But E is in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed). But we have two letters left to determine – we need to test new letters.

But we have only 3 required letters (O, S, E) and the word must be 5 letters, so we need two more letters. The best approach is to pick a word that uses O, S, E exactly once each, and introduces new letters.

Let me try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s, which is invalid (we know only one O exists).

“LOUSE” – has U new, L new, O in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

“COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“FOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“HOUSE” – same issue.

“DOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“LOUSE” – same.

“HOUSE” – same.

This is tricky. Let me try O in 4: _ _ _ O _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 1,2,3

Try S in 2, E in 1: E S _ O _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – but not a valid word.

“ENOS” – invalid.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

Wait, let me think of valid 5-letter words with O, S, E exactly once each, avoiding A,R,P,K.

Valid words:
- “HOUSE” – has two O’s (invalid)
- “LOUSE” – has U new, but O in 2 (forbidden)
- “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden)
- “COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)
- “BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)

Hmm, seems like many common words have two O’s or O in 2/3. Let me try O in 5: _ _ _ _ O
Then S must be in 2,3
E must be in 1,2,3,4

Try E in 1, S in 2, O in 5: E S _ _ O
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESINO” – not a word.

“ESITO” – not a word.

“ESCOL” – not a word.

“ESDON” – not a word.

“ESMON” – not a word.

“ESON” – too short.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESSEX” – has X new, but O in 4 (ok), S in 1 (forbidden in SPOKE), E in 2 (ok), X in 3, E in 5 (forbidden).

“ESSEX” – S in 1 (forbidden).

“ESSE” – too short.

“ESSET” – too long.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

Let me try O in 1, S in 3, E in 4: O _ S E _

“OSTEN” – not a word.

“ONSET” – has T new, N new, but O in 1 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), T in 2, N in 5. This looks valid.

“ONSET”:
- O: position 1 (allowed, previous was 3)
- N: new letter
- S: position 3 (allowed, previous was 4)

So far:
- Word structure: _ _ _ E S   (E fixed at 4, S fixed at 5)
- O must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is E, so O must be in position 1.
- That leaves positions 2 and 3 to be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, K, T, and already used O, E, S).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Try “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

We need O only once.

We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3.

Try “DOSES” – has S twice (invalid, S already used once).

Try “DONES” – has N and D, but O in 1 (ok), E in 4 (✓), S in 5 (✓). Letters: D, O, N, E, S – no forbidden letters, and O, S, E appear once each.

Check positions:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
2. Does not use A or R at all.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from their previous guesses.

Good candidates would shuffle O, S, E into new positions and fill the remaining two slots with other letters (not A or R). A simple next guess is “SPOKE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4 before).
- P and K are new letters (not A or R).
- O moves to position 2 (was 3 before).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5 before – oops, that’s the same position! Let me pick again.)

Let me try “POSED”:
- P and D are new letters.
- O in position 2 (was 3 – still not ideal.)

Better: “SOBER” – but it has two R’s (no, it has B and E, but R is forbidden).

“SLOPE”:
- S in 1 (was 4), L new, O in 2 (was 3), P new, E in 5 (was 5 – still bad).

“SHEET”:
- S in 1, H new, E in 2, E in 3 (but we can only have one E?), T new.

Actually, let’s try “SPOKE” again with E in 4 instead of 5: “SPOKE” has E in 4 (was 5 before), but K is new, P new.

Wait, simpler: “SPOKE” has O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 4 (was 5). That’s all good.

But let me pick a word that also tests new consonants. “SPOKE” uses P and K, which are both new and not forbidden.

Alternatively, “SWEET” – but that has two E’s and a T, with O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 3 (was 5), W new, T new.

But “SPOKE” seems more balanced.

Let me go with “SPOKE”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE → S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, P, K
- Letters definitely IN the word (but positions still unknown): O, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E exactly once each, does NOT contain A, R, P, K, and has none of O, S, E in their previous guess positions.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SPOKE)
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SPOKE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from SPOKE)

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have three required letters). We can pick any letter not yet used and not forbidden. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

A simple word that satisfies these: “SHEET”
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from SPOKE feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “DOSES” – but it has two S’s and a D, and we only know one S exists. Also, D is new.

Try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s and a H, and we only know one O exists. Also, U is new.

Wait, we need exactly one O, one S, one E.

Let’s try “SLOPE” – but O is in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“SPOOF” – has P (forbidden).

“SWEET” – has two E’s.

“SLEET” – has two E’s.

“SMILE” – has I new, L new, M new, but O is missing.

We need O, S, E.

Let me list possible positions:
If O is in 1: O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 2,3,4

Try O in 1, S in 2, E in 4: O S _ E _
Need two more letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I, etc.

“OSITE” – but I and T are new, but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), I in 3, T in 4, E in 5 (but E cannot be in 5). So invalid.

“OSBEN” – but N is new, B new, but E is in 4 (ok), but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), B in 3, N in 5. But E is in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed). But we have two letters left to determine – we need to test new letters.

But we have only 3 required letters (O, S, E) and the word must be 5 letters, so we need two more letters. The best approach is to pick a word that uses O, S, E exactly once each, and introduces new letters.

Let me try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s, which is invalid (we know only one O exists).

“LOUSE” – has U new, L new, O in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

“COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“FOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“HOUSE” – same issue.

“DOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“LOUSE” – same.

“HOUSE” – same.

This is tricky. Let me try O in 4: _ _ _ O _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 1,2,3

Try S in 2, E in 1: E S _ O _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – but not a valid word.

“ENOS” – invalid.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

Wait, let me think of valid 5-letter words with O, S, E exactly once each, avoiding A,R,P,K.

Valid words:
- “HOUSE” – has two O’s (invalid)
- “LOUSE” – has U new, but O in 2 (forbidden)
- “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden)
- “COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)
- “BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)

Hmm, seems like many common words have two O’s or O in 2/3. Let me try O in 5: _ _ _ _ O
Then S must be in 2,3
E must be in 1,2,3,4

Try E in 1, S in 2, O in 5: E S _ _ O
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESINO” – not a word.

“ESITO” – not a word.

“ESCOL” – not a word.

“ESDON” – not a word.

“ESMON” – not a word.

“ESON” – too short.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESSEX” – has X new, but O in 4 (ok), S in 1 (forbidden in SPOKE), E in 2 (ok), X in 3, E in 5 (forbidden).

“ESSEX” – S in 1 (forbidden).

“ESSE” – too short.

“ESSET” – too long.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

Let me try O in 1, S in 3, E in 4: O _ S E _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“OSTEN” – not a word.

“ONSET” – has T new, N new, but O in 1 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), T in 2, N in 5. This looks valid.

“ONSET”:
- O: position 1 (allowed, previous was 3)
- N: new letter
- S: position 3 (allowed, previous was 4)
- E: position 4 (allowed, previous was 5)
- T: new letter

This seems valid and tests two new letters (N, T).

Let me check:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, P, K.
- Positions of O, S, E are different from previous guesses.

Yes, “ONSET” is a valid guess.

  – O is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE and ONSET)
  – S is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from AROSE, SPOKE, ONSET)
  – Therefore S must be in position 5!

So far:
- Word structure: _ _ _ E S   (E fixed at 4, S fixed at 5)
- O must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is E, so O must be in position 1.
- That leaves positions 2 and 3 to be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, K, T, and already used O, E, S).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s pick common consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
2. Does not use A or R at all.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from their previous guesses.

Good candidates would shuffle O, S, E into new positions and fill the remaining two slots with other letters (not A or R). A simple next guess is “SPOKE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4 before).
- P and K are new letters (not A or R).
- O moves to position 2 (was 3 before).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5 before – oops, that’s the same position! Let me pick again.)

Let me try “POSED”:
- P and D are new letters.
- O in position 2 (was 3 – still not ideal.)

Better: “SOBER” – but it has two R’s (no, it has B and E, but R is forbidden).

“SLOPE”:
- S in 1 (was 4), L new, O in 2 (was 3), P new, E in 5 (was 5 – still bad).

“SHEET”:
- S in 1, H new, E in 2, E in 3 (but we can only have one E?), T new.

Actually, let’s try “SPOKE” again with E in 4 instead of 5: “SPOKE” has E in 4 (was 5 before), but K is new, P new.

Wait, simpler: “SPOKE” has O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 4 (was 5). That’s all good.

But let me pick a word that also tests new consonants. “SPOKE” uses P and K, which are both new and not forbidden.

Alternatively, “SWEET” – but that has two E’s and a T, with O in 2 (was 3), S in 1 (was 4), E in 3 (was 5), W new, T new.

But “SPOKE” seems more balanced.

Let me go with “SPOKE”.

Guess 2: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE → S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, P, K
- Letters definitely IN the word (but positions still unknown): O, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E exactly once each, does NOT contain A, R, P, K, and has none of O, S, E in their previous guess positions.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SPOKE)
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SPOKE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from SPOKE)

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
O: positions 1, 4, 5
S: positions 2, 3, 5
E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have three required letters). We can pick any letter not yet used and not forbidden. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

A simple word that satisfies these: “SHEET”
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from SPOKE feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “DOSES” – but it has two S’s and a D, and we only know one S exists. Also, D is new.

Try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s and a H, and we only know one O exists. Also, U is new.

Wait, we need exactly one O, one S, one E.

Let’s try “SLOPE” – but O is in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“SPOOF” – has P (forbidden).

“SWEET” – has two E’s.

“SLEET” – has two E’s.

“SMILE” – has I new, L new, M new, but O is missing.

We need O, S, E.

Let me list possible positions:
If O is in 1: O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 2,3,4

Try O in 1, S in 2, E in 4: O S _ E _
Need two more letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I, etc.

“OSITE” – but I and T are new, but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), I in 3, T in 4, E in 5 (but E cannot be in 5). So invalid.

“OSBEN” – but N is new, B new, but E is in 4 (ok), but O is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), B in 3, N in 5. But E is in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed). But we have two letters left to determine – we need to test new letters.

But we have only 3 required letters (O, S, E) and the word must be 5 letters, so we need two more letters. The best approach is to pick a word that uses O, S, E exactly once each, and introduces new letters.

Let me try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s, which is invalid (we know only one O exists).

“LOUSE” – has U new, L new, O in 3 (forbidden), so no.

“MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

“COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“FOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“HOUSE” – same issue.

“DOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).

“LOUSE” – same.

“HOUSE” – same.

This is tricky. Let me try O in 4: _ _ _ O _
Then S must be in 2,3,5
E must be in 1,2,3

Try S in 2, E in 1: E S _ O _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – but not a valid word.

“ENOS” – invalid.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESTOP” – invalid.

“ESTON” – invalid.

Wait, let me think of valid 5-letter words with O, S, E exactly once each, avoiding A,R,P,K.

Valid words:
- “HOUSE” – has two O’s (invalid)
- “LOUSE” – has U new, but O in 2 (forbidden)
- “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden)
- “COUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)
- “BOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden)

Hmm, seems like many common words have two O’s or O in 2/3. Let me try O in 5: _ _ _ _ O
Then S must be in 2,3
E must be in 1,2,3,4

Try E in 1, S in 2, O in 5: E S _ _ O
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“ESTON” – invalid.

“ESINO” – not a word.

“ESITO” – not a word.

“ESCOL” – not a word.

“ESDON” – not a word.

“ESMON” – not a word.

“ESON” – too short.

“ESOT” – too short.

“ESSEX” – has X new, but O in 4 (ok), S in 1 (forbidden in SPOKE), E in 2 (ok), X in 3, E in 5 (forbidden).

“ESSEX” – S in 1 (forbidden).

“ESSE” – too short.

“ESSET” – too long.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

“ESSEX” – invalid.

Let me try O in 1, S in 3, E in 4: O _ S E _
Need two new letters. Good candidates: T, N, L, I.

“OSTEN” – not a word.

“ONSET” – has T new, N new, but O in 1 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), T in 2, N in 5. This looks valid.

“ONSET”:
- O: position 1 (allowed, previous was 3)
- N: new letter
- S: position 3 (allowed, previous was 4)
- E: position 4 (allowed, previous was 5)
- T: new letter

This seems valid and tests two new letters (N, T).

Let me check:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, P, K.
- Positions of O, S, E are different from previous guesses.

Yes, “ONSET” is a valid guess.

2. SPOKE → S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)
3. ONSET → O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)

What we know for sure:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, P, K, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, E
- Exact positions we now know:
  – E is in position 4 (✓ from ONSET)
  – O is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE and ONSET)
  – S is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from AROSE, SPOKE, ONSET)
  – Therefore S must be in position 5!

So far:
- Word structure: _ _ _ E S   (E fixed at 4, S fixed at 5)
- O must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is E, so O must be in position 1.
- That leaves positions 2 and 3 to be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, K, T, and already used O, E, S).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s pick common consonants.

Try “HOUSE” – but it has two O’s (invalid, we know only one O exists).
Try “LOUSE” – O in 2 (forbidden).
Try “MOUSE” – O in 3 (forbidden).

We need O only once.

O _ _ E S
We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3.

Good candidates: D, I, L, N, etc.

Try “DOSES” – has S twice (invalid, S already used once).

Try “DONES” – has N and D, but O in 1 (ok), E in 4 (✓), S in 5 (✓). Letters: D, O, N, E, S – no forbidden letters, and O, S, E appear once each.

Check positions:
- O in 1 – allowed (was not in 1, 2, 3)
- S in 5 – allowed (was not in 1, 2, 3, 4)
- E in 4 – fixed ✓
- D and N are new letters not yet tested.

So “DONES” is a valid guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) K(x) E(-)
Guess 3: ONSET -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 4: DONES -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From Guess 4 (DONES) we just received:
D(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) S(✓)

That means:
- O is now fixed in position 2.
- N is fixed in position 3.
- E is fixed in position 4.
- S is fixed in position 5.
- D is not in the word.

So the current known structure is:
_ O N E S

Only the first letter is unknown.

Letters ruled out so far:
A, R, P, K, T, D

Letters already used (and correctly placed):
O, N, E, S

So the missing first letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O N E S:
- BONES
- CONES
- FONES (not a word)
- GONES (not a word)
- HONES (not a word)
- LONES (not a word)
- MONES (not a word)
- UONES (not a word)
- VONES (not a word)
- WONES (not a word)
- YONES (not a word)

The only valid English word among these is “BONES”.

Let me verify:
- B is not in the forbidden list.
- Fits the pattern _ O N E S.

So the next guess should be “BONES”.
