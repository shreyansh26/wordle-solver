### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

Next, I want to test new consonants while keeping A, R, E in different positions. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, D, etc. I'll form a word that keeps A, R, E but tries T and N in new positions.

One candidate: ""EARLY""
- Uses E, A, R (all confirmed letters)
- Adds L and Y (new letters to test)
- Positions: E in 1, A in 2, R in 3 (all new positions compared to AROSE)
- Doesn't reuse O or S

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

Next, I want to test new consonants while keeping A, R, E in different positions. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, D, etc. I'll form a word that keeps A, R, E but tries T and N in new positions.

One candidate: ""EARLY""
- Uses E, A, R (all confirmed letters)
- Adds L and Y (new letters to test)
- Positions: E in 1, A in 2, R in 3 (all new positions compared to AROSE)
- Doesn't reuse O or S

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>EARLY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their current constraints  
- A is in the word and is now known to be in position 2 (✓ in EARLY).  
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.  
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.  

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
O, S, L.

So far we have:
- Pos 1: not E, not O, not S  
- Pos 2: A (fixed)  
- Pos 3: not R  
- Pos 4: ?  
- Pos 5: not E, not O, not S, and not Y

We still need to place E, R, Y in the remaining slots while respecting their constraints.  
The word so far looks like: _ A _ _ _

Let’s try to fill the remaining positions with E, R, Y plus two new consonants that haven’t been ruled out and aren’t O, S, L.

Candidate consonants not yet ruled out: T, N, D, C, B, G, etc.

One valid arrangement:  
Pos 1: R (allowed, since R only can’t be in pos 2 or 3)  
Pos 2: A (fixed)  
Pos 3: Y (allowed, since Y only can’t be in pos 5)  
Pos 4: E (allowed, since E only can’t be in pos 1 or 5)  
Pos 5: T (new letter)  

This forms the word R A Y E T, which is indeed a valid 5-letter English word (though rare) and tests the remaining letters efficiently.

<guess>RAYET</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: RAYET -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: R (✓) – R is correct and in the right spot.
- Position 2: A (✓) – A is correct and in the right spot.
- Position 3: Y (✓) – Y is correct and in the right spot.
- Position 4: E (✓) – E is correct and in the right spot.
- Position 5: T (x) – T is not in the word at all.

So the word so far looks like: R A Y E _

We still need one more letter for position 5.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, L, T  
Letters already confirmed in the word: R, A, Y, E  
Remaining common consonants not yet ruled out: D, N, C, B, G, etc.

The only 5-letter English word that fits the pattern R A Y E _ and is common is R A Y E D (rade).  
Let’s check:  
- R A D E – valid word, and D has not been ruled out.

So the next logical guess is R A D E.

<guess>RADE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: RAYET -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 4: RADE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The feedback shows that the first four letters are exactly R A Y E in that order.  
The fifth letter must therefore be something that forms a valid 5-letter word starting with “RAYE_”.  

Checking a dictionary list, the only common English word that matches is “RAYED”.

All letters in “RAYED” (Y, E, D) have not been ruled out, and D has not been tested yet.  
Thus “RAYED” is the logical next guess.
