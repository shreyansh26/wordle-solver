- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

- Letters in the word but wrong spots: S (somewhere other than pos 3).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T, Y.

Remaining letters to try: consonants like D, N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, etc., and the only remaining vowel I.

The known portion of the word is M U _ _ _.  
We still need three more letters, one of which must be S (but not in position 3).  
Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants and the vowel I.

Let’s try:
- Position 3: I (remaining vowel)
- Position 4: S (known to be in the word, and not in position 3)
- Position 5: N (common consonant not yet used)

This gives the guess M U I S N, or “MUISN” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Re-arranging to a real word: M U S _ _ → “MUSIC” uses C and I (both still allowed).

Check letters:
- M and U already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S, but not in the 4th position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, V, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""SLUMP"":
- Includes S in position 1 (not 4, so valid for feedback).
- Uses U and I as remaining vowels.
- Uses L, M, P as remaining common consonants.
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – L, U, M are in the word but in the wrong positions.  
   – P is NOT in the word.

Letters we know are in the word: S, L, U, M  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- U cannot be in position 3.
- M cannot be in position 4.

We have four letters confirmed present (S, L, U, M) and we need one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants that haven’t been tried: T, N, D, C, G, H, B, F, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E, U are spoken for).

A good next guess would place the known letters in new positions and introduce a fresh consonant.  
Let’s try “MUSTY”:
- M in position 1 (new spot, not ruled out).  
- U in position 2 (new spot, not ruled out).  
- S in position 3 (new spot, not ruled out).  
- T (new consonant).  
- Y (new letter).

This covers all four known letters in untested positions and brings in two fresh letters (T, Y).

Guess 3: MUSTY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(-) T(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on MUSTY:

- M is in the correct position 1 (✓).
- U is in the correct position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- T and Y are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word and in correct spots: M (pos 1), U (pos 2).
- Letters in the word but wrong spots: S (somewhere other than pos 3).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T, Y.

Remaining letters to try: consonants like D, N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, etc., and the only remaining vowel I.

The known portion of the word is M U _ _ _.  
We still need three more letters, one of which must be S (but not in position 3).  
Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants and the vowel I.

Let’s try:
- Position 3: I (remaining vowel)
- Position 4: S (known to be in the word, and not in position 3)
- Position 5: N (common consonant not yet used)

This gives the guess M U I S N, or “MUISN” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Re-arranging to a real word: M U S _ _ → “MUSIC” uses C and I (both still allowed).

Check letters:
- M and U already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 3 for S in MUSTY, not globally).
- I and C are new letters not yet tested.

“MUSIC” is a valid 5-letter English word covering M, U, S, I, C while maintaining the known M and U in place.

From the latest feedback on MUSIC:

- M (✓) and U (✓) are still locked in positions 1 and 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- C is NOT in the word.

Current known pattern: M U _ _ _

Letters we know must appear: S, I  
Letters we know must NOT appear: A, R, O, E, P, T, Y, C

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 3 (from MUSIC) and not 4 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from MUSTY) – so S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already U, so S must be in position 5.

- I: not 4 (from MUSIC) and not 3 (from MUSTY) – so I must be in position 4.

So the word structure is: M U _ I S

We need one more consonant for position 3, chosen from letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, V, W, X, Z (excluding the already excluded set).

Common choices for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, K, N.

A quick scan of 5-letter English words matching M U _ I S gives:
- M U D I S  
- M U L I S (but L was ruled out in SLUMP)  
- M U N I S  
- M U C I S (but C was ruled out)  
- M U B I S  
- M U F I S  
- M U G I S  
- M U H I S  
- M U K I S  

Of these, “MUDIS” is not a valid word.  
“MUNIS” is also not a valid word.  
Valid words: M U D I S, M U N I S, M U C I S (but C is out), M U B I S, M U F I S, etc.

F: M U F I S (Fuis) – no.  
G: M U G I S (Guis) – no.  
H: M U H I S (Huis) – yes, “HUIS” is a valid word (Dutch loanword meaning a house, used in some English contexts).

- H and I are new letters.  
- S is in position 5, which is allowed (only positions 1 and 4 were ruled out for S).  

Thus, the next logical guess is “HUIS”.

Letters we know must NOT appear: A, R, O, E, P, T, Y, C

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 3 (from MUSIC) and not 4 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from MUSTY) – so S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already U, so S must be in position 5.

- I: not 4 (from MUSIC) and not 3 (from MUSTY) – so I must be in position 4.

So the word structure is: M U _ I S

We need one more consonant for position 3, chosen from letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, V, W, X, Z (excluding the already excluded set).

Common choices for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, K, N.

A quick scan of 5-letter English words matching M U _ I S gives:
- M U D I S  
- M U L I S (but L was ruled out in SLUMP)  
- M U N I S  
- M U C I S (but C was ruled out)  
- M U B I S  
- M U F I S  
- M U G I S  
- M U H I S  
- M U K I S  

Of these, “MUDIS” is not a valid word.  
“MUNIS” is also not a valid word.  
Valid words: M U D I S, M U N I S, M U C I S (but C is out), M U B I S, M U F I S, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S, but not in the 4th position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, V, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""SLUMP"":
- Includes S in position 1 (not 4, so valid for feedback).
- Uses U and I as remaining vowels.
- Uses L, M, P as remaining common consonants.
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

<guess>SLUMP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – L, U, M are in the word but in the wrong positions.  
   – P is NOT in the word.

Letters we know are in the word: S, L, U, M  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- U cannot be in position 3.
- M cannot be in position 4.

We have four letters confirmed present (S, L, U, M) and we need one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants that haven’t been tried: T, N, D, C, G, H, B, F, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E, U are spoken for).

A good next guess would place the known letters in new positions and introduce a fresh consonant.  
Let’s try “MUSTY”:
- M in position 1 (new spot, not ruled out).  
- U in position 2 (new spot, not ruled out).  
- S in position 3 (new spot, not ruled out).  
- T (new consonant).  
- Y (new letter).

This covers all four known letters in untested positions and brings in two fresh letters (T, Y).

<guess>MUSTY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)
Guess 3: MUSTY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(-) T(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on MUSTY:

- M is in the correct position 1 (✓).
- U is in the correct position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- T and Y are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word and in correct spots: M (pos 1), U (pos 2).
- Letters in the word but wrong spots: S (somewhere other than pos 3).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T, Y.

Remaining letters to try: consonants like D, N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, etc., and the only remaining vowel I.

The known portion of the word is M U _ _ _.  
We still need three more letters, one of which must be S (but not in position 3).  
Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants and the vowel I.

Let’s try:
- Position 3: I (remaining vowel)
- Position 4: S (known to be in the word, and not in position 3)
- Position 5: N (common consonant not yet used)

This gives the guess M U I S N, or “MUISN” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Re-arranging to a real word: M U S _ _ → “MUSIC” uses C and I (both still allowed).

Check letters:
- M and U already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 3 for S in MUSTY, not globally).
- I and C are new letters not yet tested.

“MUSIC” is a valid 5-letter English word covering M, U, S, I, C while maintaining the known M and U in place.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)
Guess 3: MUSTY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(-) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: MUSIC -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(-) I(-) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on MUSIC:

- M (✓) and U (✓) are still locked in positions 1 and 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- C is NOT in the word.

Current known pattern: M U _ _ _

Letters we know must appear: S, I  
Letters we know must NOT appear: A, R, O, E, P, T, Y, C

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 3 (from MUSIC) and not 4 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from MUSTY) – so S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already U, so S must be in position 5.

- I: not 4 (from MUSIC) and not 3 (from MUSTY) – so I must be in position 4.

So the word structure is: M U _ I S

We need one more consonant for position 3, chosen from letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, V, W, X, Z (excluding the already excluded set).

Common choices for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, K, N.

A quick scan of 5-letter English words matching M U _ I S gives:
- M U D I S  
- M U L I S (but L was ruled out in SLUMP)  
- M U N I S  
- M U C I S (but C was ruled out)  
- M U B I S  
- M U F I S  
- M U G I S  
- M U H I S  
- M U K I S

HUIS is not exactly five letters (it’s a Dutch loanword for “house” used in some contexts, but not standard English).  
The game is looking for a **valid** English 5-letter word that starts with M U and ends with IS.

From earlier rounds we have locked positions:
1: M  
2: U  
5: S  

We still need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Allowed consonants (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: I (only remaining vowel not yet placed).

We must form a valid English word of the form M U _ I S or M U _ S I (but S is already fixed at 5), so the pattern must be M U _ I S.

Valid English 5-letter words fitting M U _ I S:
- MUDIS – invalid  
- MUNIS – invalid  
- MUSIS – invalid  
- MUCIS – C is out  
- MUGIS – G is okay, but “MUGIS” isn’t a recognized word.  
- MULIS – L is out.  
- MUSIS – not valid.  
- MUDIS – not valid.  

The only real word left is **MUGIL** (but L hasn’t been placed yet), but L hasn’t been ruled out (it was ruled out in SLUMP, but that was position 2; here we’re talking about position 3).  
Wait – let’s list all remaining consonants for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, V, W, X, Z.

Valid English word:  
M U B I S – “MUBIS” isn’t valid.  
M U D I S – “MUDIS” isn’t valid.  
M U F I S – “MUFIS” isn’t valid.  
M U G I S – “MUGIS” isn’t valid.  
M U H I S – “MUHIS” isn’t valid.  
M U K I S – “MUKIS” isn’t valid.  
M U N I S – “MUNIS” isn’t valid.  
M U V I S – “MUVIS” isn’t valid.  
M U W I S – “MUWIS” isn’t valid.  
M U X I S – “MUXIS” isn’t valid.  
M U Z I S – “MUZIS” isn’t valid.  

But wait – the only valid word fitting M U _ I S is **MUDIS**? No.  

Actually, the correct valid word is **MUGIL**? But L hasn’t been placed yet.  

Let me re-examine:  
We have M U _ _ S, with S fixed at 5.  
We need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Valid English word: **MUGIL** (fish) – but L is in position 4, which is okay because L was only ruled out in position 2 (SLUMP).  

Let me check:  
M U G I L – but this has L in position 4, which is allowed.  
And G and I are new letters.  

Thus, the next guess is **MUGIL**.
