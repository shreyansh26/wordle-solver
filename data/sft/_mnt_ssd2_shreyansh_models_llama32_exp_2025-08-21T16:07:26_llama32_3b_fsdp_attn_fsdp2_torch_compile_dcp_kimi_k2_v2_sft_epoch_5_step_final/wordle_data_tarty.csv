For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and is in position 4.

So we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include A in a different position (not 3).
3. Use new letters we haven’t tried yet (common consonants and vowels like R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T in position 4 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- I, N, R are fresh letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and is in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include A in a different position (not 3).
3. Use new letters we haven’t tried yet (common consonants and vowels like R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T in position 4 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- I, N, R are fresh letters.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S, L, E are out.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T still correct in position 4.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I and N are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Contains: A (not in 3), R (not in 2)
- Excludes: S, L, E, I, N

Good remaining consonants to try: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already in).

I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Places A in a new spot (1 or 2 or 5).
- Places R in a new spot (1, 3, or 5).
- Uses fresh letters.

Candidate: “PARTY”
- P: new letter.
- A: in position 2 (new spot).
- R: in position 3 (new spot).
- T: fixed in position 4.
- Y: new letter.

This satisfies all constraints.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and is in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include A in a different position (not 3).
3. Use new letters we haven’t tried yet (common consonants and vowels like R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T in position 4 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- I, N, R are fresh letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S, L, E are out.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T still correct in position 4.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I and N are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Contains: A (not in 3), R (not in 2)
- Excludes: S, L, E, I, N

Good remaining consonants to try: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already in).

I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Places A in a new spot (1 or 2 or 5).
- Places R in a new spot (1, 3, or 5).
- Uses fresh letters.

Candidate: “PARTY”
- P: new letter.
- A: in position 2 (new spot).
- R: in position 3 (new spot).
- T: fixed in position 4.
- Y: new letter.

This satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)

Guess 3: PARTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is locked in position 4.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T still correct in position 4.
   - A is still in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

3. PARTY → P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - Every letter is now correct and in the right place:
     - Position 1: ?
     - Position 2: A
     - Position 3: R
     - Position 4: T
     - Position 5: Y
   - P is not in the word.

So the secret word must be: _ A R T Y

The only remaining letter is the first one. We need a 5-letter word that ends in “ARTY”. 

Common 5-letter words ending in “ARTY”:
- CARTY (but C was never tested; we’ve eliminated S, L, E, I, N, P)
- WATER (but W was never tested; we’ve eliminated S, L, E, I, N, P)
- MARTY (not a valid English word)
- BARTY (not a valid English word)

The only valid option left is CARTY, since C has not been ruled out yet.

Therefore, the correct word is CARTY.

Guess 4: CARTY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the four rounds we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is locked in position 4.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T still correct in position 4.
   - A is still in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

3. PARTY → P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - Every letter was correct and in the right place: _ A R T Y.

4. CARTY → C(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - C is not in the word.
   - A, R, T, Y are all confirmed in their positions.

So the secret word is exactly: _ A R T Y

We just need to determine the first letter. Letters already eliminated include: S, L, E, I, N, P, C. The remaining common first-letter options are B, D, F, G, H, K, M, etc.

Looking at valid 5-letter words that end in “ARTY”:
- BARTY (not a standard word)
- DARTY (not standard)
- FARTY (not standard)
- GARTY (not standard)
- HARTY (not standard)
- KARTY (not standard)
- MARTY (not standard)
- WATER (but W hasn’t been tested)
- CARTY (already tried and C is out)

The only valid English word left is WATER, but W hasn’t been eliminated yet. Let’s check if WATER fits:
- W hasn’t been used or eliminated yet, so it’s a possible first letter.
- WATER: W A R T Y → all letters fit the constraints.

Therefore, the correct word must be WATER.
