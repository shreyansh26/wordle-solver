From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid for feedback).
- Uses I and U as new vowels.
- Uses T, N, G as new consonants.
This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid for feedback).
- Uses I and U as new vowels.
- Uses T, N, G as new consonants.
This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters definitely OUT: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, U  
Letters definitely IN: S, I, L (from FUSIL feedback: L is in the word but not in position 5)

S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
That leaves S only in position 5.

I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.  
But position 5 is already taken by S, so I must be in position 1 or 2.

L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already satisfied), and from FUSIL we saw L in position 5 got “-”, so L could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So far we have:

- Position 1: could be I or L
- Position 2: could be I or L (or S, but S must be at 5)
- Position 3: could be L, but not I (since I cannot be here)
- Position 4: could be L, but not I
- Position 5: must be S

Thus the word structure is:  
[I or L] [not I] [not L] [not L] S

We still need three more letters, none of which are any of the banned ones (A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, U).

Remaining common consonants: D, C, M, P, H, B, K, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none (only I is allowed vowel left).

Let’s try a word that fits:  
If we place I in position 1, we need three consonants for positions 2-4.  
A good candidate: “DILSY” – but Y is less common, and D, I, L, S, Y:  
- D, I, L are all allowed so far.  
- S is confirmed at 5.  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L is in position 3 (allowed).  

But “DILSY” isn’t a common word. Let’s pick a more common word: “CILDS” – no, that’s not valid.  
Another option: “HILDS” – invalid.  
“PILDS” – invalid.

Let’s try placing L in position 2 and I in position 1:  
Word structure: I L _ _ S  
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
Common word: “ILD” is 4 letters – no.  
“ILS” is 4 letters – no.

Let’s try I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I _ _ S  
Need L and two other consonants.  
Common word: “LILKS” – K is allowed, but “LILKS” isn’t common.  
“PILLS” – double S, but S is already at 5, and we don’t know about double-S.  
“PILAF” – contains F, which is banned.

Let’s try L in position 1:  
Structure: L _ _ _ S  
I must fit in one of positions 2-4.  
“L I _ _ S” – need two consonants.  
“L I C K S” – “LICKS” – no.  
“L I D D S” – “LIDDS” – no.  
“L I M M S” – “LIMMS” – no.

I must be in 1 or 2.  
“D I M L S” – “DIMLS” – no.  
“C I M L S” – “CIMLS” – no.

Let’s try I in position 2, L in position 3:  
Structure: _ I L _ S  
Need consonants for 1 and 4.  
“C I L D S” – “CILD S” – no.  
“B I L D S” – “BILD S” – no.

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 2:

Need consonants for 3 and 4.  
“ILK S” – need 4 letters.  
“ILMPS” – no.  
“ILKES” – contains E (banned).

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 3:  
Structure: I _ L _ S  
Need consonants for 2 and 4.  
“ I D L K S” – “IDLKS” – no.  
“ I C L D S” – “ICLDS” – no.

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 4:  
Structure: I _ _ L S  
Need consonants for 2 and 3.  
“ I D K L S” – “IDKLS” – no.  
“ I C L K S” – “ICLK S” – no.

Let’s try L in position 3, I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I L _ S  
Same issue as above.

Let’s try L in position 2, I in position 4:  
Structure: _ I _ I S – but I cannot be in position 4 (from STING feedback).  
So this is invalid.

Let’s try L in position 3, I in position 5:  
Structure: _ _ L _ S  
I must be in 5, but 5 is S – conflict.

Let’s try L in position 4, I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I _ L S  
Same conflict as above.

Ah! I see the issue: we have only one vowel (I) and one consonant (L) that we know are definitely in, while S is fixed at 5.  
We need three more letters, none of which are banned.

Let’s pick a common word that fits:  
“P I L K S” – no.  
“C I L K S” – no.  
“B I L K S” – no.

Let’s try “H I L L S” – double L, but L is already confirmed.  
“HILLS” – valid word, contains H, I, L, L, S  
- H is allowed  
- I is allowed, position 2 (not 3 or 4) – ok  
- L is allowed, position 3 – ok  
- Second L is allowed, position 4 – ok  
- S is fixed at 5 – ok  

This seems valid and uses common letters not yet ruled out.

Therefore, my next guess is HILLS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid for feedback).
- Uses I and U as new vowels.
- Uses T, N, G as new consonants.
This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

<guess>STING</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, O, E are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - T, N, G are out.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- Letters definitely included: S, I
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4, and must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3, and must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, M, P, H, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E are out, and I is already confirmed).

I need a word that:
- Contains S and I
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, N, G)

Let’s try a word like ""USING"":
- U (new vowel)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (but feedback says I is not in position 3) – oops, invalid.

Try ""LUSHS"":
- L, U, S, H, S – but S is duplicated and we don’t know if S appears twice.
Also, S is in position 4 which is ruled out.

Try ""PIUSH"":
- P, I, U, S, H
- S is in position 4 – ruled out.

Try ""DUSKY"":
- D, U, S, K, Y
- S is in position 3 – allowed
- I is not present, but we know I must be in the word – so invalid.

Try ""FUSIL"":
- F, U, S, I, L
- S in position 3 – allowed
- I in position 4 – allowed
- All letters are new and not ruled out yet.

This seems valid.

Letters definitely IN: S, I, L (from FUSIL feedback: L is in the word but not in position 5)

S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
That leaves S only in position 5.

I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.  
But position 5 is already taken by S, so I must be in position 1 or 2.

L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already satisfied), and from FUSIL we saw L in position 5 got “-”, so L could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So far we have:

- Position 3: could be L, but not I (since I cannot be here)
- Position 4: could be L, but not I

“PILAF” – contains F, which is banned.

Let’s try L in position 1:

“L I _ _ S” – need two consonants.  
“L I C K S” – “LICKS” – no.  
“L I D D S” – “LIDDS” – no.  
“L I M M S” – “LIMMS” – no.

Let’s try L in position 3:  
Structure: _ _ L _ S  
I must be in 1 or 2.  
“D I L K S” – “DILKS” – no.  
“C I L D S” – “CILD S” – no.  
“P I L D S” – “PILD S” – no.

Let’s try L in position 4:  
Structure: _ _ _ L S  
I must be in 1 or 2.  
“D I M L S” – “DIMLS” – no.  
“C I M L S” – “CIMLS” – no.

Let’s try I in position 2, L in position 3:  
Structure: _ I L _ S  
Need consonants for 1 and 4.  
“C I L D S” – “CILD S” – no.  
“B I L D S” – “BILD S” – no.

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 2:  
Structure: I L _ _ S  
Need consonants for 3 and 4.  
“ILK S” – need 4 letters.  
“ILMPS” – no.  
“ILKES” – contains E (banned).

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 3:  
Structure: I _ L _ S  
Need consonants for 2 and 4.  
“ I D L K S” – “IDLKS” – no.  
“ I C L D S” – “ICLDS” – no.

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 4:  
Structure: I _ _ L S  
Need consonants for 2 and 3.  
“ I D K L S” – “IDKLS” – no.  
“ I C L K S” – “ICLK S” – no.

Let’s try L in position 3, I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I L _ S  
Same issue as above.

Let’s try L in position 2, I in position 4:  
Structure: _ I _ I S – but I cannot be in position 4 (from STING feedback).  
So this is invalid.

Let’s try L in position 3, I in position 5:  
Structure: _ _ L _ S  
I must be in 5, but 5 is S – conflict.

Let’s try L in position 4, I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I _ L S  
Same conflict as above.

Ah! I see the issue: we have only one vowel (I) and one consonant (L) that we know are definitely in, while S is fixed at 5.  
We need three more letters, none of which are banned.

Let’s pick a common word that fits:  
“P I L K S” – no.  
“C I L K S” – no.  
“B I L K S” – no.

Let’s try “H I L L S” – double L, but L is already confirmed.  
“HILLS” – valid word, contains H, I, L, L, S  
- H is allowed  
- I is allowed, position 2 (not 3 or 4) – ok  
- L is allowed, position 3 – ok  
- Second L is allowed, position 4 – ok  
- S is fixed at 5 – ok  

This seems valid and uses common letters not yet ruled out.

Therefore, my next guess is HILLS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid for feedback).
- Uses I and U as new vowels.
- Uses T, N, G as new consonants.
This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, O, E are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - T, N, G are out.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- Letters definitely included: S, I
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4, and must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3, and must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, M, P, H, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E are out, and I is already confirmed).

I need a word that:
- Contains S and I
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, N, G)

Let’s try a word like ""USING"":
- U (new vowel)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (but feedback says I is not in position 3) – oops, invalid.

Try ""LUSHS"":
- L, U, S, H, S – but S is duplicated and we don’t know if S appears twice.
Also, S is in position 4 which is ruled out.

Try ""PIUSH"":
- P, I, U, S, H
- S is in position 4 – ruled out.

Try ""DUSKY"":
- D, U, S, K, Y
- S is in position 3 – allowed
- I is not present, but we know I must be in the word – so invalid.

Try ""FUSIL"":
- F, U, S, I, L
- S in position 3 – allowed
- I in position 4 – allowed
- All letters are new and not ruled out yet.

This seems valid.

<guess>FUSIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: FUSIL -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(x) S(-) I(-) L(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters definitely OUT: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, U  
Letters definitely IN: S, I, L (from FUSIL feedback: L is in the word but not in position 5)

S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
That leaves S only in position 5.

I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.  
But position 5 is already taken by S, so I must be in position 1 or 2.

L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already satisfied), and from FUSIL we saw L in position 5 got “-”, so L could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So far we have:

- Position 1: could be I or L
- Position 2: could be I or L (or S, but S must be at 5)
- Position 3: could be L, but not I (since I cannot be here)
- Position 4: could be L, but not I
- Position 5: must be S

Thus the word structure is:  
[I or L] [not I] [not L] [not L] S

We still need three more letters, none of which are any of the banned ones (A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, U).

Remaining common consonants: D, C, M, P, H, B, K, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none (only I is allowed vowel left).

Let’s try a word that fits:  
If we place I in position 1, we need three consonants for positions 2-4.  
A good candidate: “DILSY” – but Y is less common, and D, I, L, S, Y:  
- D, I, L are all allowed so far.  
- S is confirmed at 5.  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L is in position 3 (allowed).  

But “DILSY” isn’t a common word. Let’s pick a more common word: “CILDS” – no, that’s not valid.  
Another option: “HILDS” – invalid.  
“PILDS” – invalid.

Let’s try placing L in position 2 and I in position 1:  
Word structure: I L _ _ S  
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
Common word: “ILD” is 4 letters – no.  
“ILS” is 4 letters – no.

Let’s try I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I _ _ S  
Need L and two other consonants.  
Common word: “LILKS” – K is allowed, but “LILKS” isn’t common.  
“PILLS” – double S, but S is already at 5, and we don’t know about double-S.  
“PILAF” – contains F, which is banned.

Let’s try L in position 1:  
Structure: L _ _ _ S  
I must fit in one of positions 2-4.  
“L I _ _ S” – need two consonants.  
“L I C K S” – “LICKS” – no.  
“L I D D S” – “LIDDS” – no.  
“L I M M S” – “LIMMS” – no.

Let’s try L in position 3:  
Structure: _ _ L _ S  
I must be in 1 or 2.  
“D I L K S” – “DILKS” – no.  
“C I L D S” – “CILD S” – no.  
“P I L D S” – “PILD S” – no.

Let’s try L in position 4:  
Structure: _ _ _ L S  
I must be in 1 or 2.  
“D I M L S” – “DIMLS” – no.  
“C I M L S” – “CIMLS” – no.

Let’s try I in position 2, L in position 3:  
Structure: _ I L _ S  
Need consonants for 1 and 4.  
“C I L D S” – “CILD S” – no.  
“B I L D S” – “BILD S” – no.

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 2:  
Structure: I L _ _ S  
Need consonants for 3 and 4.  
“ILK S” – need 4 letters.  
“ILMPS” – no.  
“ILKES” – contains E (banned).

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 3:  
Structure: I _ L _ S  
Need consonants for 2 and 4.  
“ I D L K S” – “IDLKS” – no.  
“ I C L D S” – “ICLDS” – no.

Let’s try I in position 1, L in position 4:  
Structure: I _ _ L S  
Need consonants for 2 and 3.  
“ I D K L S” – “IDKLS” – no.  
“ I C L K S” – “ICLK S” – no.

Let’s try L in position 3, I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I L _ S  
Same issue as above.

Let’s try L in position 2, I in position 4:  
Structure: _ I _ I S – but I cannot be in position 4 (from STING feedback).  
So this is invalid.

Let’s try L in position 3, I in position 5:  
Structure: _ _ L _ S  
I must be in 5, but 5 is S – conflict.

Let’s try L in position 4, I in position 2:  
Structure: _ I _ L S  
Same conflict as above.

Ah! I see the issue: we have only one vowel (I) and one consonant (L) that we know are definitely in, while S is fixed at 5.  
We need three more letters, none of which are banned.

Let’s pick a common word that fits:  
“P I L K S” – no.  
“C I L K S” – no.  
“B I L K S” – no.

Let’s try “H I L L S” – double L, but L is already confirmed.  
“HILLS” – valid word, contains H, I, L, L, S  
- H is allowed  
- I is allowed, position 2 (not 3 or 4) – ok  
- L is allowed, position 3 – ok  
- Second L is allowed, position 4 – ok  
- S is fixed at 5 – ok  

This seems valid and uses common letters not yet ruled out.

Therefore, my next guess is HILLS.

<guess>HILLS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: FUSIL -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(x) S(-) I(-) L(-)
Guess 4: HILLS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on HILLS:
- H is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- L is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓)
- Second L is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓)
- S is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓)

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: L (fixed)
- Position 4: L (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)

We know the word is of the form _ I L L S.

Letters used so far and ruled out:
A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, U, H

Remaining possible first letters (common ones): B, C, D, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in ""ILLS"":
- BILLS – valid word
- CILLS – not a word
- DILLS – not a word
- JILLS – not a word
- KILLS – valid word
- MILLS – valid word
- PILLS – valid word
- VILLS – not a word
- WILLS – valid word
- YILLS – not a word

From these, BILLS, KILLS, MILLS, PILLS, WILLS are all valid.  
Let me pick the most common one: PILLS.

But wait – P, I, L, L, S – let’s check if P is allowed (it hasn’t been ruled out).  
Yes, P is allowed.

So the guess is PILLS.
