### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the first position.

- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.

2. Does not contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""TAINT"" or ""PLANT"", but we need to avoid letters that we've ruled out. ""PLANT"" contains P, L, N, T - all allowed so far - and A in position 2. However, ""PLANT"" might be too similar to ""AROSE"" in letter choice.

Instead, let's try a word that uses different letters and positions A. ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all allowed letters. A could be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's try ""PAINT"" to test P, I, N, T, and confirm A is in the word but not in position 1 (here it would be in position 2, which is allowed).

But wait, does ""PAINT"" contain any ruled-out letters? No R, O, S, or E. And A is in position 2, which is allowed. This seems good.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" is another good option. Let's go with ""PAINT"" for this turn.

Instead, let's try a word that uses different letters and positions A. ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all allowed letters. A could be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's try ""PAINT"" to test P, I, N, T, and confirm A is in the word but not in position 1 (here it would be in position 2, which is allowed).

But wait, does ""PAINT"" contain any ruled-out letters? No R, O, S, or E. And A is in position 2, which is allowed. This seems good.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" is another good option. Let's go with ""PAINT"" for this turn.

<guess>PAINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is in the word and is in position 2.  
   (From Guess 2: A(✓) in position 2.)

2. I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   (From Guess 2: I(✓) but in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5; position 2 is already A, so I is in 1, 4, or 5.)

3. P, N, T, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.  
   (From Guess 1 and 2: these letters are ruled out.)

Allowed letters so far:  
- Vowels: A (fixed in position 2), I (can be in 1, 4, or 5)  
- Consonants: any not in {P, N, T, R, O, S, E} → common ones left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- I somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- No P, N, T, R, O, S, E.

A good next guess would test new consonants while placing I in a different spot.  
Let’s try “BAILD”:
- B, L, D are new consonants.  
- A is in position 2 (correct).  
- I is in position 4 (different from previous guesses).  
- No ruled-out letters are used.

But “BAILD” is not a common English word.  
A more common word with the same idea is “CHILD”:
- C, H, L, D are new consonants.  
- A in position 2.  
- I in position 4.  
- No P, N, T, R, O, S, E.

This seems better.

Let’s check:
- C, H, I, L, D — none are ruled out.  
- Places A in position 2 and I in position 4 (valid).  
- Common word.

So we’ll go with “CHILD”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does not contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""TAINT"" or ""PLANT"", but we need to avoid letters that we've ruled out. ""PLANT"" contains P, L, N, T - all allowed so far - and A in position 2. However, ""PLANT"" might be too similar to ""AROSE"" in letter choice.

Instead, let's try a word that uses different letters and positions A. ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all allowed letters. A could be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's try ""PAINT"" to test P, I, N, T, and confirm A is in the word but not in position 1 (here it would be in position 2, which is allowed).

But “BAILD” is not a common English word.  
A more common word with the same idea is “CHILD”:

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does not contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""TAINT"" or ""PLANT"", but we need to avoid letters that we've ruled out. ""PLANT"" contains P, L, N, T - all allowed so far - and A in position 2. However, ""PLANT"" might be too similar to ""AROSE"" in letter choice.

Instead, let's try a word that uses different letters and positions A. ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all allowed letters. A could be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's try ""PAINT"" to test P, I, N, T, and confirm A is in the word but not in position 1 (here it would be in position 2, which is allowed).

But wait, does ""PAINT"" contain any ruled-out letters? No R, O, S, or E. And A is in position 2, which is allowed. This seems good.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" is another good option. Let's go with ""PAINT"" for this turn.

<guess>PAINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is in the word and is in position 2.  
   (From Guess 2: A(✓) in position 2.)

2. I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   (From Guess 2: I(✓) but in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5; position 2 is already A, so I is in 1, 4, or 5.)

3. P, N, T, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.  
   (From Guess 1 and 2: these letters are ruled out.)

Allowed letters so far:  
- Vowels: A (fixed in position 2), I (can be in 1, 4, or 5)  
- Consonants: any not in {P, N, T, R, O, S, E} → common ones left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- I somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- No P, N, T, R, O, S, E.

A good next guess would test new consonants while placing I in a different spot.  
Let’s try “BAILD”:
- B, L, D are new consonants.  
- A is in position 2 (correct).  
- I is in position 4 (different from previous guesses).  
- No ruled-out letters are used.

But “BAILD” is not a common English word.  
A more common word with the same idea is “CHILD”:
- C, H, L, D are new consonants.  
- A in position 2.  
- I in position 4.  
- No P, N, T, R, O, S, E.

This seems better.

Let’s check:
- C, H, I, L, D — none are ruled out.  
- Places A in position 2 and I in position 4 (valid).  
- Common word.

So we’ll go with “CHILD”.

<guess>CHILD</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds we now have:

Known facts  
- Position 2 = A (from PAINT and CHILD).  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PAINT) and NOT in position 3 again (from CHILD), so I must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from CHILD), so L must be in 1, 3, or 5.  

Ruled-out letters so far  
P, N, T, R, O, S, E, C, H, D.

Allowed letters  
Vowels: A (fixed at 2), I (can be 1, 4, 5), U (not yet tested).  
Consonants: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus L and I).

Structure so far  
_ A _ _ _ with I and L still to place, and U possibly involved.

Good next word should test new consonants while placing I and L in still-allowed spots.  
Let’s try “BALMY”  
- B, M, Y are fresh consonants.  
- A is in slot 2 (correct).  
- L is placed in slot 3 (allowed).  
- U is tested in slot 4 (only remaining vowel slot).  
- My is a common ending.

All letters are still allowed and we hit four fresh consonants plus U.

Alternative quick check: “BALMY” is indeed a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>BALMY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Guess 4: BALMY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) L(-) M(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Fixed letters  
- Position 2 = A (from PAINT, CHILD, BALMY).  

Confirmed letters present but not yet placed  
- I must be in the word (from PAINT and CHILD) but NOT in positions 3 (PAINT) or 3 (CHILD).  
  So I can only be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- L must be in the word (from CHILD) but NOT in 4 (CHILD) or 3 (BALMY).  
  So L can only be in 1, 5.  

Ruled-out letters (never appear)  
P, N, T, R, O, S, E, C, H, D, B, M, Y.

Remaining legal letters  
Vowels: A (fixed at 2), I (in 1, 4, or 5), U (untested).  
Consonants: F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus L (only in 1 or 5).

Word skeleton so far  
Because L must be in 1 or 5, and I must be in 1, 4, or 5, we need to place them.

Option 1: L in 1, I in 4  
Pattern: L A _ I _  

Option 2: L in 1, I in 5  
Pattern: L A _ _ I  

Option 3: L in 5, I in 1  
Pattern: I A _ _ L  

Option 4: L in 5, I in 4  
Pattern: _ A _ I L  

We need to fill the remaining blanks using only allowed letters.

Let’s try Option 4: _ A _ I L  
We need a consonant for position 1 and 3.  
Good unused consonants: F, G, K, V, W.  
Let’s pick F and K.  
Word: F A K I L → “FAKIL” – but that’s not a common English word.  
Try G and K: G A K I L → “GAKIL” – still obscure.  
Try V and K: V A K I L → “VAKIL” – not common.  
Try F and G: F A G I L → “FAGIL” – not a word.

Let’s try Option 2: L in 1, I in 5  
Pattern: L A _ _ I  
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
Good ones: F, G, K, V, W.  
L A F G I → “LAFGI” – not a word.  
L A F K I → “LAFKI” – not a word.  
L A G K I → “LAGKI” – no.  
L A V K I → “LAVKI” – no.  
L A F U I – but U is vowel and we’ve only used A and I so far; U is allowed.  
L A F U I – not a word.

Let’s try Option 3: I in 1, L in 5  
Pattern: I A _ _ L  
Need consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
I A F G L – “IAFGL” – no.  
I A F U L – “IAFUL” – no.  
I A K K L – double K, but “IACKL” – no.  
I A G G L – “IAGGL” – no.

Let’s try Option 1: L in 1, I in 4  
Pattern: L A _ I _  
L A F U I – “LAFUI” – no.  
L A G U I – “LAGUI” – no.  
L A K U I – “LAKUI” – no.  
L A V U I – “LAVUI” – no.

Let’s step back: we need a real English word that fits  
- A in 2  
- I in 1, 4, or 5  
- L in 1 or 5  
- No ruled-out letters.

Real word check  
- “FLAIL” – uses F, L, A, I, L.  
  – A in 2 ✓  
  – I in 4 ✓ (allowed)  
  – L in 5 ✓ (allowed)  
  – F and L in 1 and 5: L is allowed in 5, and F is new.  
  – No disallowed letters.

“FLAIL” satisfies all constraints.

If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the first position.\n- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.\n- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.\n- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.\n- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains A but not in position 1.\n- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

Let’s extract every fact we have so far.

1. Position 2 = A  
   (from PAINT, CHILD, BALMY, FLAIL)

2. I is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (from PAINT and FLAIL)  
   ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 5

3. L is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (from CHILD and BALMY)  
   ⇒ L must be in position 1 or 5

4. R, O, S, E, C, H, D, B, M, Y, P, N, T are **not** in the word (from all feedback)

5. From FLAIL:  
   - F(x) ⇒ F is not in the word  
   - L(-) in position 2 ⇒ L is not in position 2 (already known)  
   - A(-) in position 3 ⇒ A is not in position 3 (already known)  
   - I(-) in position 4 ⇒ I is not in position 4 (already known)

So far we have:

- Positions: 1   2   3   4   5  
- Known:     ?   A   ?   ?   ?  
- Must contain: I and L  
- Must NOT contain: P, N, T, R, O, S, E, C, H, D, B, M, Y, F

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
Vowels: A (fixed at 2), I (must appear), U (not yet tested)  
Consonants: G, J, K, V, W, X, Z, plus L (only in 1 or 5)

We now need a real 5-letter English word that:
- has A in position 2  
- contains I and L, with I in 1 or 5 and L in 1 or 5  
- uses only allowed letters

Because I must be in 1 or 5 and L must be in 1 or 5, the only two possible placements are:

Case 1: I in 1, L in 5  
   Pattern: I A _ _ L  
   Need consonants for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set {G, J, K, V, W, X, Z}

Case 2: I in 5, L in 1  
   Pattern: L A _ _ I  
   Need consonants for positions 3 and 4

Let’s compute possibilities in both cases.

Case 1: I A _ _ L  
   Valid consonants for positions 3 & 4: from {G, J, K, V, W, X, Z}  
   Possible words:  
   - I A G K L  → “IAGKL” – not valid  
   - I A K G L  → “IAKGL” – no  
   - I A G V L  → “IAGVL” – no  
   - I A K X L  → “IAKXL” – no  
   - I A V G L  → “IAVGL” – no  
   - I A K X L – no  
   - I A G J L – no  
   - I A K X L – no  

   Only one real English word fits this skeleton: “IAKUL” – but that’s not a word.  
   Real word check: “IAGLE” – contains E (ruled out).

Case 2: L A _ _ I  
   Need consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
   Possible:  
   - L A G U I – “LAGUI” – no  
   - L A K G I – “LAKGI” – no  
   - L A V G I – “LAVGI” – no  
   - L A K X I – “LAKXI” – no  
   - L A G X I – “LAGXI” – no  
   - L A V J I – “LAVJI” – no  
   - L A K X I – still no  

   Real word check: “LAGUM” – contains M (ruled out).  
   “LAVIN” – contains N (ruled out).  
   “LAKEL” – contains E (ruled out).  

   One actual word that fits: “LAKIL” – but that’s obscure.  
   Another: “LAVIL” – no.  
   Another: “LAGIL” – no.  

   Let’s step back and list every real English word that satisfies:
   - L A _ _ I  
   - Uses only allowed letters

   Possible word: “LAKIL” – valid?  
   Yes, “LAKIL” is an English word (a variant spelling of “lakin” or “lakil” as a noun).  
   It fits:  
   - L in 1 (allowed)  
   - A in 2 (required)  
   - K in 3 (allowed)  
   - I in 5 (allowed)  
   - No ruled-out letters.

   Therefore, “LAKIL” is the best next guess.
