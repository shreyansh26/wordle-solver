### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A T E.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: S, L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Has T in position 4.
- Has E in position 5.
- Does not contain S or L.

Possible candidates: 
- ""CRATE"" – but C is not ruled out yet, and we have no info on R, C.
- ""GRATE"" – G not ruled out.
- ""PLATE"" – P not ruled out, but L is already ruled out.
- ""BRATE"" – B not ruled out.
- ""FRATE"" – F not ruled out.
- ""CRATE"" seems like a strong candidate as C is a common consonant.

Let me pick ""CRATE"" since it uses a new consonant (C) and fits the pattern perfectly.

Let’s list all five-letter words that fit _ R A T E and do not contain S, L, C, B, D:

- FRATE – F is allowed.
- GRATE – G is allowed.
- PRATE – P is allowed.
- TRATE – T is allowed (and would be in position 1).
- WRATE – W is allowed.

Among these, “TRATE” is the most common English word and uses T in position 1, which has not been ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “TRATE”.
