### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: U (first position) and I (third position)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  
- Does contain U and I, but U is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3

Remaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels (besides U, I): none, since A, O, E are out

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses both U and I
2. Places U somewhere other than position 1
3. Places I somewhere other than position 3
4. Uses only the still-allowed consonants

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints gives me “BUILD” (but D is allowed, L is allowed, etc.), but I need to ensure I also include the required U and I.

A word that satisfies all this is “BUILD”:
- B, U, I, L, D – none of these are in the banned list.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 – but feedback already tells us I is not in position 3 (it’s marked “-” in UNITY). So BUILD is invalid because I would be in position 3.

Next candidate: “QUICK” – but Q is rarely a vowel and U is already required.  
“QUICK” has Q, U, I, C, K – but Q is not strictly a vowel, and we might prefer to avoid it.  

Another candidate: “FILMY” – but it lacks the required U.  

A better choice is “HUMID”:
- H, U, M, I, D – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2.  
- I is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know I is not in position 3).

So “HUMID” looks valid and meets all constraints.

Let me double-check:
- Letters: H, U, M, I, D – none are in the banned list.  
- Positions: U not in 1, I not in 3 – this is consistent with feedback.

Thus, my next guess is HUMID.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nAnother good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  \nThat means we need a completely fresh set of letters.  \nI want a word that still uses common consonants and vowels so I can quickly gather new information.  \nA good next choice is “UNITY”: it contains three common vowels (U, I, Y counts as vowel) and two common consonants (N, T) that weren’t used yet.  \nThis will give us maximal new information in one guess.\n\n<guess>UNITY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n\n- Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  \n- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: U (first position) and I (third position)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  \n- Does contain U and I, but U is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3\n\nRemaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  \nRemaining vowels (besides U, I): none, since A, O, E are out\n\nI need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Uses both U and I\n2. Places U somewhere other than position 1\n3. Places I somewhere other than position 3\n4. Uses only the still-allowed consonants\n\nA quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints gives me “BUILD” (but D is allowed, L is allowed, etc.), but I need to ensure I also include the required U and I.\n\nA word that satisfies all this is “BUILD”:\n- B, U, I, L, D – none of these are in the banned list.  \n- U is in position 2 (allowed).  \n- I is in position 3 – but feedback already tells us I is not in position 3 (it’s marked “-” in UNITY). So BUILD is invalid because I would be in position 3.\n\nNext candidate: “QUICK” – but Q is rarely a vowel and U is already required.  \n“QUICK” has Q, U, I, C, K – but Q is not strictly a vowel, and we might prefer to avoid it.  \n\nAnother candidate: “FILMY” – but it lacks the required U.  \n\nA better choice is “HUMID”:\n- H, U, M, I, D – all allowed letters.  \n- U is in position 2.  \n- I is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know I is not in position 3).\n\nSo “HUMID” looks valid and meets all constraints.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- Letters: H, U, M, I, D – none are in the banned list.  \n- Positions: U not in 1, I not in 3 – this is consistent with feedback.\n\nThus, my next guess is HUMID.\n\n<guess>HUMID</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: HUMID -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) M(-) I(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the new feedback on HUMID:

- H(x) – H is not in the word.  
- U(✓) – U is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).  
- M(-) – M is in the word but not in position 3.  
- I(✓) – I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).  
- D(✓) – D is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ U _ I D

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y, H.

Letters we know ARE in the word: U (fixed at position 2), I (fixed at position 4), D (fixed at position 5).

M is in the word but not at position 3, so M must be at position 1.

Therefore, the word must be: M U _ I D.

The only remaining letter is position 3. Allowed consonants (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, Z.

Common 5-letter words fitting M U _ I D:
- M U C I D (valid, but “MUCID” is not a common English word)
- M U L I D (valid word: “MULID” is not common)
- M U F I D (not a word)
- M U D I D (invalid, D already at position 5)
- M U C I D (not common)

Actually, the only common English word fitting M U _ I D is “MUCID” (a medical term), but that’s obscure. Another possibility is “MUDID” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Wait, let me re-examine:

The pattern is M U _ I D. The only common English word fitting this is “MUDID” (not valid), “MURID” (not valid), “MUCID” (valid but rare), or “MUDD” (invalid).

Actually, the valid common word is “MUCID” (a type of bacteria), but it’s rare. Another check: “MUDIE” – but E is already ruled out.

Upon further review, the only valid common English word fitting M U _ I D is “MUCID”. However, “MUCID” is a valid medical term (plural of mucid). But if we want a more common word, we might have missed something.

Wait, let’s list all possible consonants for position 3 and see which forms a valid word:

Allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, Z.

Possible words:
- M U B I D → “MUBID” – not valid
- M U C I D → “MUCID” – valid (medical term)
- M U F I D → “MUFID” – not valid
- M U G I D → “MUGID” – not valid
- M U L I D → “MULID” – not valid
- M U P I D → “MUPID” – not valid
- M U V I D → “MUVID” – not valid
- M U W I D → “MUWID” – not valid
- M U Z I D → “MUZID” – not valid

Thus, the only valid word is “MUCID”. However, if we want a more common word, we might have missed another possibility.

Rechecking the constraints:
- M is in word, not at position 3 – we’ve placed it at position 1, which is allowed.
- U is at position 2 (correct).
- I is at position 4 (correct).
- D is at position 5 (correct).
- Position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

The only valid common word is “MUCID”.

But if we can’t find a common word, we must choose the most likely or plausible word fitting the pattern. In medical terminology, “MUCID” is the plural of mucus, so it’s reasonable to consider it.

However, another possibility exists: “MUDIE” – but E is ruled out. 

Thus, the only valid word is “MUCID”. But to be safe and stick to more common words, I’ll go with “MUCID”.

But wait – let me check if there’s another common word. Another candidate is “MULID” – but not valid. 

Upon deeper reflection, the correct and only valid common English word fitting M U _ I D is indeed “MUCID”. But if that’s too obscure, the next best is to test “MUCID” as it’s the only logical fit.

Therefore, the next guess is MUCID.
