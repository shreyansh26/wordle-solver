### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - hitting some of the most common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good vowel-consonant balance.

- E cannot be 5th (from AROSE) or 3rd (from STEAL). So E must be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

- E is in 1st (allowed).

- E cannot be 5th (from AROSE) or 3rd (from STEAL). So E must be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Also, we need two new consonants to fill the remaining two slots.

A straightforward candidate is “EASEL” but L is already excluded. Next, try “SNEAK”:
- S (2nd), N (new), E (1st), A (3rd), K (new).
Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, E – yes.
- S is in 2nd (allowed).
- E is in 1st (allowed).
- A is in 3rd (allowed).
- No R, O, T, L – yes.
- Two new letters N and K are fine.

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - hitting some of the most common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O
- Letters that ARE in the word (but misplaced): A, S, E
- We need to reposition A, S, E and add new consonants/vowels while avoiding R and O.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) to test.
3. Avoid R and O.

Candidate: “STEAL”
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T is new.
- E moves to position 3 (was 5).
- A moves to position 2 (was 1).
- L is new.

This covers all known letters (A, S, E) in new spots and adds two new common consonants (T, L).

Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, S, E are in the word but misplaced.
   - R and O are not in the word.

2. STEAL → S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
   - S, E, A are again confirmed to be in the word but still misplaced.
   - T and L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT present: R, O, T, L
- Letters definitely present (but position unknown): A, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, E exactly once each (since no feedback suggests duplicates).
- Avoids positions 1 and 4 for A and S respectively (from AROSE and STEAL feedback).
- Avoids positions 3 and 5 for E respectively (from STEAL and AROSE feedback).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters A, S, E.

Let’s map valid positions:
- A cannot be 1st or 2nd (from AROSE and STEAL). So A must be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
- S cannot be 4th (from AROSE) or 1st (from STEAL). So S must be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.
- E cannot be 5th (from AROSE) or 3rd (from STEAL). So E must be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Also, we need two new consonants to fill the remaining two slots.

A straightforward candidate is “EASEL” but L is already excluded. Next, try “SNEAK”:
- S (2nd), N (new), E (1st), A (3rd), K (new).
Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, E – yes.
- S is in 2nd (allowed).
- E is in 1st (allowed).
- A is in 3rd (allowed).
- No R, O, T, L – yes.
- Two new letters N and K are fine.

This seems valid.

2. STEAL → S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)

  – S: cannot be 1, 4 (from AROSE and STEAL/SNEAK).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We need two more distinct letters (not yet used) to fill the remaining two slots, chosen from the unused alphabet minus {R, O, T, L, N, K}. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y.

- Positions:
  – E is in 1st (allowed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - hitting some of the most common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O
- Letters that ARE in the word (but misplaced): A, S, E
- We need to reposition A, S, E and add new consonants/vowels while avoiding R and O.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) to test.
3. Avoid R and O.

Candidate: “STEAL”
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T is new.
- E moves to position 3 (was 5).
- A moves to position 2 (was 1).
- L is new.

This covers all known letters (A, S, E) in new spots and adds two new common consonants (T, L).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, S, E are in the word but misplaced.
   - R and O are not in the word.

2. STEAL → S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
   - S, E, A are again confirmed to be in the word but still misplaced.
   - T and L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT present: R, O, T, L
- Letters definitely present (but position unknown): A, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, E exactly once each (since no feedback suggests duplicates).
- Avoids positions 1 and 4 for A and S respectively (from AROSE and STEAL feedback).
- Avoids positions 3 and 5 for E respectively (from STEAL and AROSE feedback).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters A, S, E.

Let’s map valid positions:
- A cannot be 1st or 2nd (from AROSE and STEAL). So A must be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
- S cannot be 4th (from AROSE) or 1st (from STEAL). So S must be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.
- E cannot be 5th (from AROSE) or 3rd (from STEAL). So E must be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Also, we need two new consonants to fill the remaining two slots.

A straightforward candidate is “EASEL” but L is already excluded. Next, try “SNEAK”:
- S (2nd), N (new), E (1st), A (3rd), K (new).
Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, E – yes.
- S is in 2nd (allowed).
- E is in 1st (allowed).
- A is in 3rd (allowed).
- No R, O, T, L – yes.
- Two new letters N and K are fine.

This seems valid.

Guess 3: SNEAK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(x) E(-) A(-) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – A, S, E are in the word but misplaced.
   – R, O are not in the word.

2. STEAL → S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
   – T, L are not in the word.
   – Confirms A, S, E are present but still positions unknown.

3. SNEAK → S(-) N(x) E(-) A(-) K(x)
   – N, K are not in the word.
   – S, E, A are again confirmed misplaced.

Current knowledge:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, S, E (each exactly once).
- Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, T, L, N, K.
- Position constraints so far:
  – A: cannot be 1, 2 (from AROSE and STEAL/SNEAK).
  – S: cannot be 1, 4 (from AROSE and STEAL/SNEAK).
  – E: cannot be 3, 5 (from AROSE and STEAL/SNEAK).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We need two more distinct letters (not yet used) to fill the remaining two slots, chosen from the unused alphabet minus {R, O, T, L, N, K}. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place A, S, E while adding two new letters. One promising arrangement is:
- E in 1st (allowed).
- S in 2nd (allowed).
- A in 4th (allowed).
- Two new letters: we could use C and D or F and M.

Candidate: “ESCAD” – but CAD is not a common English word.

Better: “EASEL” – but L is excluded.

Next: “SABLE” – but L is excluded.

Try “BASED”:
- B (new), A (3rd – allowed), S (2nd – allowed), E (1st – allowed), D (new).
Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, E – yes.
- No R, O, T, L, N, K – yes.
- Positions:
  – E is in 1st (allowed).
  – S is in 2nd (allowed).
  – A is in 3rd (allowed).
- Letters B and D are new and common.

This seems valid.

From all feedback:

Known letters in the word: A, S, E (each once)
Known letters NOT in the word: R, O, T, L, N, K, B, D, F, C

Current position constraints (after 5 guesses):

- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

- A:
  – Cannot be 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE, STEAL, SNEAK, BASED, FACES)
  – Cannot be 4 (from BASED) – already excluded from 1,2,3
  – Therefore A must be in position 5, but position 5 is already S
  – This is impossible, which means my earlier deduction is wrong.

Wait – re-read the feedback for Guess 5:

FACES -> Feedback: F(x) A(-) C(x) E(-) S(✓)

The symbol “-” here means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.  
So A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from FACES).  
Previously we had:
- A(-) from AROSE (pos 1)
- A(-) from STEAL (pos 4)
- A(-) from SNEAK (pos 4)
- A(-) from BASED (pos 2)
- A(-) from FACES (pos 2)

Collecting all exclusions:
Positions 1, 2, 4 are now ruled out for A.

But position 5 is already S (✓), so A cannot be 5.

This leaves only position 3 for A.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3.
- S must be in position 5 (✓).
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (from earlier exclusions it cannot be 3,4,5).

So possible patterns:
1. E A S _ S  – but position 4 would be the same as 5, which is invalid.
2. E _ S A S  – invalid (A in 4 is excluded).
3. _ E S A S  – invalid (A in 4 is excluded).

Wait – let’s re-express:

A is excluded from positions 1,2,4.  
S is excluded from positions 1,2,4.  
E is excluded from positions 3,5.

So:
- A must be in position 3.
- S must be in position 5 (✓).
- E must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s enumerate valid positions:

Real words fitting “_E_A_S”:
None with allowed letters.

Try “HEAS” + a letter – but “HEAS” is not valid.

Real word check: “PEACH” – but C and H are allowed?  
C is excluded (from FACES feedback).  

Another approach: use known letters and new ones systematically.

Let’s try “G E A S” + one letter – but that’s 5 letters: “GEAS” + ? – invalid.

Real word: “HEMAS” – but M is allowed, H is allowed.
