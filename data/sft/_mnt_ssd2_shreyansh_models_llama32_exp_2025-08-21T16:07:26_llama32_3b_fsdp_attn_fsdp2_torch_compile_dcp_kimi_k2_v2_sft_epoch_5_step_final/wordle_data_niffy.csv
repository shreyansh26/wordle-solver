### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common 5-letter words.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet.  
Good candidates among the remaining common consonants and vowels include:  
- I, U (vowels)  
- T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, R, etc. (consonants)  

A balanced word that uses several of these new letters without repeating any is “UNTIL”.  
It gives us:

From the feedback so far:

- Contains N and I somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

We know:
- N is NOT in position 2 (was in position 2 in UNTIL).
- I is NOT in position 4 (was in position 4 in UNTIL).

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use N and I in new positions.
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible without violating the “x” marks.

A balanced choice is “MINDY”:
- M, D, Y are fresh letters.
- N and I are reused, placed in positions 2 and 3 (neither is in its previous disallowed spot).

This should maximize information gain.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common 5-letter words.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet.  
Good candidates among the remaining common consonants and vowels include:  
- I, U (vowels)  
- T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, R, etc. (consonants)  

A balanced word that uses several of these new letters without repeating any is “UNTIL”.  
It gives us:  
- U (vowel)  
- N, T, I, L (all new consonants)  

This should provide maximal information gain in a single guess.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L are all ruled out (marked “x”).
- N and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked “-”).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and I somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried yet include: D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus any duplicates of N or I we might discover.

We know:
- N is NOT in position 2 (was in position 2 in UNTIL).
- I is NOT in position 4 (was in position 4 in UNTIL).

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use N and I in new positions.
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible without violating the “x” marks.

A balanced choice is “MINDY”:
- M, D, Y are fresh letters.
- N and I are reused, placed in positions 2 and 3 (neither is in its previous disallowed spot).

This should maximize information gain.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common 5-letter words.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet.  
Good candidates among the remaining common consonants and vowels include:  
- I, U (vowels)  
- T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, R, etc. (consonants)  

A balanced word that uses several of these new letters without repeating any is “UNTIL”.  
It gives us:  
- U (vowel)  
- N, T, I, L (all new consonants)  

This should provide maximal information gain in a single guess.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L are all ruled out (marked “x”).
- N and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked “-”).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and I somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried yet include: D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus any duplicates of N or I we might discover.

We know:
- N is NOT in position 2 (was in position 2 in UNTIL).
- I is NOT in position 4 (was in position 4 in UNTIL).

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use N and I in new positions.
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible without violating the “x” marks.

A balanced choice is “MINDY”:
- M, D, Y are fresh letters.
- N and I are reused, placed in positions 2 and 3 (neither is in its previous disallowed spot).

This should maximize information gain.

<guess>MINDY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: MINDY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:

Letters we know:
- I is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ in MINDY).
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (it was in positions 2, 3, 2 again, all marked “-”).
- Y is in the word and is in position 5 (✓ in MINDY).

Forbidden letters (x in any feedback): A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, D.

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ Y

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Z, plus N (which must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4).

N cannot be in position 2 (already taken by I) or 5 (already taken by Y), so N must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We need two more distinct letters from the available set to fill positions 1, 3, or 4 (whichever of 1,3,4 N doesn’t occupy).

Let’s try placing N in position 3:

Word pattern: _ I N _ Y

We need a first and fourth letter from the remaining pool.  
Good candidates: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, W.

A strong choice is “WINNY”:
- W and N are fresh letters.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- Fits the pattern _ I N _ Y.

Let’s check: W, I, N, N, Y – but N is repeated. The rules don’t forbid duplicates, so WINNY is valid.

However, WINNY uses N twice; we might learn more by using two different letters.  
Another option: “KINNY” – also uses N twice.

A better choice with distinct letters: “HINNY” – but “HINNY” isn’t a valid English word.

Next best: “PINKY” – but K isn’t used yet, and P, I, N, K, Y are all allowed, distinct letters.

But we need to ensure we stay within valid English words.  
Let’s try “PINKY” – valid word, uses P, I, N, K, Y.

But wait: N is in position 3 in PINKY, which is allowed (only positions 2 and 5 are fixed).  
So PINKY is a valid candidate.

But let’s double-check:  
- P, I, N, K, Y – none are in the forbidden list.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in 2, Y in 5 (matches ✓).  

Thus PINKY is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: MINDY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: PINKY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(-) K(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:

- Position 2 = I (✓)
- Position 5 = Y (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from previous feedback: positions 2,3,5 gave “-” or “x” for N)
  – Therefore N must be in position 1 or 4.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, D, P, K.

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z, plus N (only in positions 1 or 4).

Pattern so far: _ I _ _ Y

If N is in position 1: N I _ _ Y  
We need two distinct letters from the remaining pool for positions 3 and 4.

Good candidates: B, C, F, G, H, J, V, W.

Let’s try N I C H Y – valid word, uses N, I, C, H, Y.  
But H hasn’t been used yet; let’s see if it fits:  
- C and H are new, allowed.  
- N is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Y is fixed in 5.  
- I is fixed in 2.  

So “NICHY” is a valid candidate.

If N is in position 4: _ I _ N Y  
We’d need a letter in position 1 and 3.  
Example: C I V N Y – but “CIVNY” isn’t a word.  
“H” + “G” = “HINGY” (invalid).  
“W” + “I” = already invalid (I used).  
“W” + “N” = “WINDY” – but N would be in position 4 (allowed), and W, D are still allowed?  
Wait: D was ruled out in Guess 3 (MINDY). So WINDY is invalid (D forbidden).

So the only valid word fitting all constraints appears to be “NICHY”.

Let’s verify:  
- N in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (fixed), C and H new, Y in 5 (fixed).  
- All letters allowed by current constraints.

Thus, the next guess is NICHY.
