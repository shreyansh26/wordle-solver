For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and including multiple vowels. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in the first position (✓)
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, or E.

We now need a 5-letter word starting with C that avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

Common letters still available: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses some of these remaining common letters to maximize information. A good choice might be:

Current constraints:
- First letter is C (fixed).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, U, D.
- Letters in the word but wrong position: L (it is somewhere, just not in position 2).
- Letters in the word and in correct positions: C (1st), O (3rd).

So the pattern is: C _ O _ _

Available letters (excluding R, A, N, E, U, D):
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I (since O is already placed, and we know E, A, U are out)

We need to place L somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but position 3 is O, so 4 or 5). Also, we need to fill positions 2 and 5 with remaining letters.

Possible words:
- C _ O L _
- C _ O _ L

Let's think of common words fitting these patterns:
- COBOL (but O is already in position 3, and this uses O twice which might be allowed, but we have no info on duplicates)
- COMMA (but M is allowed, but A is out)
- COPAL (but A is out)
- CLOWN (but W and N are allowed, but N is out)
- COBOL seems possible: C O B O L (but we don't know about duplicates)
- COGIL (but G, I, L are allowed)
- COBOL is valid: C O B O L

Wait, let's think of simpler ones: C _ O _ _ with remaining letters. If we fix L in position 4 or 5, we can try:
- C H O L I (but H, I are allowed)
- C H O O L (but O is already in position 3)
- C H O K L (but K is allowed)

Actually, let's list possible letters for position 2 and 5:
Position 2: S, T, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 5: S, T, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, L (but L can't be in position 2, and is already in position 4 or 5)

Looking for common words:
- C H O L I (but I is allowed)
- C H O O L (but O is already in position 3)
- C H O K L (but K is allowed)

Actually, let's try COBOL: C O B O L. This uses B, I (allowed letters) and places L in position 5. But we have C(✓) O(✓) _ _ L, and positions 2 and 4 need filling.

But COBOL has O in position 2 and 4, which might be acceptable (we know O is in position 3, but it could be in duplicates).

However, let's think of better options:
- C H O L I (but I is allowed)
- C H O K L (K is allowed)

Actually, let's try C H O K L - but this is 5 letters: C H O K L. This uses H, K, L. But we need C _ O _ _.

Wait, I'm confusing the positions. Let me re-express:

Current pattern: C _ O _ _ (C fixed at 1, O fixed at 3)

Letters to place: L must be in 4 or 5.

So possible patterns:
1. C _ O L _
2. C _ O _ L

For pattern 1 (C _ O L _):
- Position 2: any allowed letter (S, T, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 5: any allowed letter

For pattern 2 (C _ O _ L):
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 4: any allowed letter
- Position 5: L (but L can't be in position 2, and is already in position 5 - this is fine)

Looking for common words:
- C H O L I (but I is allowed)
- C H O O L (but O is already in position 3)
- C H O K L (but K is allowed)
- C H O M L (but M is allowed)

Actually, let's think systematically:

For pattern 1 (C _ O L _):
Possible words:
- C H O L I (H, I allowed)
- C H O L K (K allowed)
- C H O L M (M allowed)
- C H O L T (T allowed)

For pattern 2 (C _ O _ L):
Possible words:
- C H O M L (M, L allowed)
- C H O K L (K allowed)
- C H O B L (B allowed)
- C H O P L (P allowed)

Let's pick one that uses common remaining letters: CHOLI (but I is allowed, H, O, L, I are allowed). But we need to check if I is allowed - since vowels are limited, I is a vowel-like letter.

But let's think of better options:
- C H O L I
- C H O K L
- C H O M L

CHOLI seems plausible: C H O L I. This uses H, L, I. All letters are allowed.

Another option: C H O M L (but M is allowed).

Let's go with CHOLI as it uses common letters and fits the constraints.

But wait, let me check:
- C H O L I: C(✓), H(?), O(✓), L(?), I(?)
- Positions: C fixed at 1, O at 3, L at 4, I at 5
- This uses H, I, L - all allowed.

So CHOLI is a valid next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 3
- L is in the word but not in position 2
- Letters not in the word: R, A, N, E, U, D, and also position 2 cannot be R, A, N, E, U, D, and position 5 cannot be R, A, N, E, U, D, L (since L is in the word but not in position 2, and position 2 is the only remaining place L could be - but we know L is in the word, so it must be in position 4 or 5). Since position 2 is open, and we have no info, we need to test letters.

My next guess will test new letters while placing L in a possible position. I'll try:

- C H O L I (but H, I are allowed)
- C H O O L (but O is already in position 3)

Actually, let's list possible letters for position 2 and 5:
Position 2: S, T, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Actually, let's think systematically:

For pattern 1 (C _ O L _):
Possible words:
- C H O L I (H, I allowed)
- C H O L K (K allowed)
- C H O L M (M allowed)
- C H O L T (T allowed)

For pattern 2 (C _ O _ L):
Possible words:
- C H O M L (M, L allowed)
- C H O K L (K allowed)
- C H O B L (B allowed)
- C H O P L (P allowed)

Let's pick one that uses common remaining letters: CHOLI (but I is allowed, H, O, L, I are allowed). But we need to check if I is allowed - since vowels are limited, I is a vowel-like letter.

But let's think of better options:
- C H O L I
- C H O K L
- C H O M L

CHOLI seems plausible: C H O L I. This uses H, L, I. All letters are allowed.

Another option: C H O M L (but M is allowed).

Let's go with CHOLI as it uses common letters and fits the constraints.

But wait, let me check:
- C H O L I: C(✓), H(?), O(✓), L(?), I(?)
- Positions: C fixed at 1, O at 3, L at 4, I at 5
- This uses H, I, L - all allowed.

So CHOLI is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 3
- L is in the word but not in position 2
- Letters not in the word: R, A, N, E, U, D, and also position 2 cannot be R, A, N, E, U, D, and position 5 cannot be R, A, N, E, U, D, L (since L is in the word but not in position 2, and position 2 is the only remaining place L could be - but we know L is in the word, so it must be in position 4 or 5). Since position 2 is open, and we have no info, we need to test letters.

My next guess will test new letters while placing L in a possible position. I'll try:",Guess 3: CHOLI -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) O(✓) L(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
