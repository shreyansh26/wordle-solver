For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Next: “TOUCH” – O is position 2 (good), T is position 1 (new), N is position 3 (new), but H is new and allowed.

But let’s check: T is in position 1 (allowed), O in 2, N in 3 (allowed), U in 4, C in 5. No banned letters. This seems valid.

Another option: “NOTCH” – but N is position 1 (allowed), O in 2, T in 3 (allowed), C in 4, H in 5. Also valid.

Between “TOUCH” and “NOTCH”, “NOTCH” places N in position 1 and T in position 3, giving us more information.

So I’ll go with “NOTCH”.

From the latest feedback on NOTCH:
- N is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) – so the secret word has N in position 1.
- O is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) – so the secret word has O in position 2.
- T is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) – so the secret word has T in position 3.
- C and H are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word has the pattern N O T _ _.

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, S, E, P, I, C, H):
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The most common remaining consonants are D, L, M, G, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- NOTED (but E is excluded)
- NOTEL (but E is excluded)
- NOTUM (but U is allowed, M is allowed)
- NOTKO (K and O are allowed, but O is already in position 2)
- NOTGY (G and Y are allowed)

Looking for common patterns:
- NOTED: invalid (E)
- NOTUM: N O T U M – uses U and M, both allowed.
- NOTGY: N O T G Y – uses G and Y, both allowed.

NOTUM seems like a strong candidate as it uses common letters U and M.

Another check: is NOTUM a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it’s a recognized word (not a proper noun).

So I’ll go with NOTUM.
