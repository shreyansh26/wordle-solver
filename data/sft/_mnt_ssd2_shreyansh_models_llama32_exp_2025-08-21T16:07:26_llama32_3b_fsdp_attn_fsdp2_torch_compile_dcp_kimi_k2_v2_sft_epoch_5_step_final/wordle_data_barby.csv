For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
2. Avoids O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good candidate letters to try next: I, T, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""TRAIN"":
- Uses R (not in position 2, here it's position 2 - but that's invalid since R was ""-"" in position 2).
Wait, that violates the condition.

Let me try ""RATIO"":
- R is in position 1 - but that's invalid since R was ""-"" in position 1.

Better approach: Since A is somewhere (positions 2-5) and R is somewhere (positions 1,3-5), and we can't use O/S/E, let's try a word like ""DRAIN"":
- D, R, A, I, N - all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 - but that contradicts the feedback (R was ""-"" in position 2).

Another approach: Since A and R must be present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively, let's try a word like ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K - all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

Let me try ""TRAIN"" again but move R to a different position:
- TRAIN: T, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 - still invalid.

Better: ""CARAV"" - but that's not a valid word.

Valid option: ""RIVAL"":
- R, I, V, A, L
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was ""-"" in position 1 in AROSE? Wait no, in AROSE R was in position 2, so position 1 is allowed.)

But I is a vowel-like letter, and R is in position 1 (not 2), A is somewhere (position 3 or 4 or 5). This seems valid.

Another check: ""RIVAL"" uses R, I, V, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
- R:1 (allowed, since R was ""-"" in position 2)
- A:3 (allowed, since A was ""-"" in position 1)
- I, V, L: new letters to test.

This seems like a good second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
2. Avoids O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good candidate letters to try next: I, T, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""TRAIN"":
- Uses R (not in position 2, here it's position 2 - but that's invalid since R was ""-"" in position 2).
Wait, that violates the condition.

Let me try ""RATIO"":
- R is in position 1 - but that's invalid since R was ""-"" in position 1.

Better approach: Since A is somewhere (positions 2-5) and R is somewhere (positions 1,3-5), and we can't use O/S/E, let's try a word like ""DRAIN"":
- D, R, A, I, N - all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 - but that contradicts the feedback (R was ""-"" in position 2).

Another approach: Since A and R must be present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively, let's try a word like ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K - all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

Let me try ""TRAIN"" again but move R to a different position:
- TRAIN: T, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 - still invalid.

Better: ""CARAV"" - but that's not a valid word.

Valid option: ""RIVAL"":
- R, I, V, A, L
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was ""-"" in position 1 in AROSE? Wait no, in AROSE R was in position 2, so position 1 is allowed.)

But I is a vowel-like letter, and R is in position 1 (not 2), A is somewhere (position 3 or 4 or 5). This seems valid.

Another check: ""RIVAL"" uses R, I, V, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
- R:1 (allowed, since R was ""-"" in position 2)
- A:3 (allowed, since A was ""-"" in position 1)
- I, V, L: new letters to test.

This seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: RIVAL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) V(x) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. RIVAL → R(-) I(x) V(x) A(-) L(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - I, V, L are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, I, V, L.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

Remaining common consonants to try: D, N, T, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Remaining vowels (since O, E, I are out): U is the only common vowel left.

Let’s build a word that:
- Uses A and R (with the position rules above).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Prefers common letters.

A good candidate is “DARKY”:
- D, R, A, K, Y – all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRANK”:
- C, R, A, N, K – all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 – again invalid.

Next: “TARDY”:
- T, A, R, D, Y – all allowed letters.
- R is in position 3 – allowed (not ruled out yet).
- A is in position 2 – allowed (not positions 1 or 4).

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A and R.
- R is in position 3 (not 1 or 2).
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4).
- No O, S, E, I, V, L.

So “TARDY” is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on TARDY:
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know they cannot be:
  – From AROSE: cannot be O, S, E
  – From RIVAL: cannot be I, V, L
  – From TARDY: cannot be T, D

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z
plus any vowels left: U is the only common vowel not yet used.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 that are not in the forbidden set.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants that haven’t been tried yet. Let’s try:
- N for position 1
- M for position 4

This gives us the word ""NORMY"". Let me check:
- N, O, R, M, Y – but O is forbidden (from AROSE), so this is invalid.

Next try: ""CARNY"" – but C, A, R, N, Y are all allowed letters.
- C is allowed.
- A, R, Y are confirmed correct positions.
- N is allowed.

But we need to check if CARNY is valid – it’s not a common word (Carny is a slang term but not standard).

Better: ""MARRY"" – but R is already in position 3, and we can’t use R again in position 4 (no restriction, but we already have R in position 3).

Wait, the word must have unique letters in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s try ""BARRY"" – but again R is duplicated.

Better: ""FARCY"" – but not a valid word.

Let’s try ""HARPY"" – but P, Y are allowed, H, A, R, P, Y – but A is in position 2, R in 3, Y in 5. So H A R P Y – positions 1,4 are H, P. Both allowed.

But ""HARPY"" is a valid word.

However, let’s double-check: H, A, R, P, Y – none of the forbidden letters are used.

Another option: ""MARRY"" – but R is duplicated.

Let’s go with ""HARPY"" as it introduces new common consonants H and P.

But wait, position 4 must be a consonant since positions 2,3,5 are A,R,Y. So H A R P Y – position 4 is P, which is allowed.

But is HARPY a valid word? Yes.

However, let me think of a more common word. ""FARCY"" isn’t valid. ""CARNY"" is slang.

Let’s try ""BARKY"" – B, A, R, K, Y – positions 1,4: B, K. Both allowed.

""BARKY"" is a valid word.

But let me think of the most common word: ""FARCY"" no, ""CARNY"" no, ""BARKY"" yes.

Alternatively, ""GARBY"" – but G, B allowed, but ""GARBY"" is valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Another approach: Since A and R must be present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively, let's try a word like ""CRANK"":

- TRAIN: T, R, A, I, N

- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know they cannot be:
  – From AROSE: cannot be O, S, E
  – From RIVAL: cannot be I, V, L
  – From TARDY: cannot be T, D

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z
plus any vowels left: U is the only common vowel not yet used.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 that are not in the forbidden set.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants that haven’t been tried yet. Let’s try:
- N for position 1
- M for position 4

This gives us the word ""NORMY"". Let me check:
- N, O, R, M, Y – but O is forbidden (from AROSE), so this is invalid.

Next try: ""CARNY"" – but C, A, R, N, Y are all allowed letters.
- C is allowed.
- A, R, Y are confirmed correct positions.
- N is allowed.

But we need to check if CARNY is valid – it’s not a common word (Carny is a slang term but not standard).

Better: ""MARRY"" – but R is already in position 3, and we can’t use R again in position 4 (no restriction, but we already have R in position 3).

Wait, the word must have unique letters in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s try ""BARRY"" – but again R is duplicated.

Better: ""FARCY"" – but not a valid word.

Let’s try ""HARPY"" – but P, Y are allowed, H, A, R, P, Y – but A is in position 2, R in 3, Y in 5. So H A R P Y – positions 1,4 are H, P. Both allowed.

But ""HARPY"" is a valid word.

However, let’s double-check: H, A, R, P, Y – none of the forbidden letters are used.

Another option: ""MARRY"" – but R is duplicated.

Let’s go with ""HARPY"" as it introduces new common consonants H and P.

But wait, position 4 must be a consonant since positions 2,3,5 are A,R,Y. So H A R P Y – position 4 is P, which is allowed.

But is HARPY a valid word? Yes.

However, let me think of a more common word. ""FARCY"" isn’t valid. ""CARNY"" is slang.

Let’s try ""BARKY"" – B, A, R, K, Y – positions 1,4: B, K. Both allowed.

""BARKY"" is a valid word.

But let me think of the most common word: ""FARCY"" no, ""CARNY"" no, ""BARKY"" yes.

Alternatively, ""GARBY"" – but G, B allowed, but ""GARBY"" is valid.

But ""BARKY"" is more common.

Let me go with ""BARKY"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
2. Avoids O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good candidate letters to try next: I, T, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""TRAIN"":
- Uses R (not in position 2, here it's position 2 - but that's invalid since R was ""-"" in position 2).
Wait, that violates the condition.

Let me try ""RATIO"":
- R is in position 1 - but that's invalid since R was ""-"" in position 1.

Better approach: Since A is somewhere (positions 2-5) and R is somewhere (positions 1,3-5), and we can't use O/S/E, let's try a word like ""DRAIN"":
- D, R, A, I, N - all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 - but that contradicts the feedback (R was ""-"" in position 2).

Another approach: Since A and R must be present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively, let's try a word like ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K - all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

Let me try ""TRAIN"" again but move R to a different position:
- TRAIN: T, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 - still invalid.

Better: ""CARAV"" - but that's not a valid word.

Valid option: ""RIVAL"":
- R, I, V, A, L
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was ""-"" in position 1 in AROSE? Wait no, in AROSE R was in position 2, so position 1 is allowed.)

But I is a vowel-like letter, and R is in position 1 (not 2), A is somewhere (position 3 or 4 or 5). This seems valid.

Another check: ""RIVAL"" uses R, I, V, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
- R:1 (allowed, since R was ""-"" in position 2)
- A:3 (allowed, since A was ""-"" in position 1)
- I, V, L: new letters to test.

This seems like a good second guess.

<guess>RIVAL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RIVAL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) V(x) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. RIVAL → R(-) I(x) V(x) A(-) L(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - I, V, L are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, I, V, L.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

Remaining common consonants to try: D, N, T, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Remaining vowels (since O, E, I are out): U is the only common vowel left.

Let’s build a word that:
- Uses A and R (with the position rules above).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Prefers common letters.

A good candidate is “DARKY”:
- D, R, A, K, Y – all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRANK”:
- C, R, A, N, K – all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 – again invalid.

Next: “TARDY”:
- T, A, R, D, Y – all allowed letters.
- R is in position 3 – allowed (not ruled out yet).
- A is in position 2 – allowed (not positions 1 or 4).

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A and R.
- R is in position 3 (not 1 or 2).
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4).
- No O, S, E, I, V, L.

So “TARDY” is a valid next guess.

<guess>TARDY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RIVAL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) V(x) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: TARDY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on TARDY:
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know they cannot be:
  – From AROSE: cannot be O, S, E
  – From RIVAL: cannot be I, V, L
  – From TARDY: cannot be T, D

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z
plus any vowels left: U is the only common vowel not yet used.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 that are not in the forbidden set.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants that haven’t been tried yet. Let’s try:
- N for position 1
- M for position 4

This gives us the word ""NORMY"". Let me check:
- N, O, R, M, Y – but O is forbidden (from AROSE), so this is invalid.

Next try: ""CARNY"" – but C, A, R, N, Y are all allowed letters.
- C is allowed.
- A, R, Y are confirmed correct positions.
- N is allowed.

But we need to check if CARNY is valid – it’s not a common word (Carny is a slang term but not standard).

Better: ""MARRY"" – but R is already in position 3, and we can’t use R again in position 4 (no restriction, but we already have R in position 3).

Wait, the word must have unique letters in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s try ""BARRY"" – but again R is duplicated.

Better: ""FARCY"" – but not a valid word.

Let’s try ""HARPY"" – but P, Y are allowed, H, A, R, P, Y – but A is in position 2, R in 3, Y in 5. So H A R P Y – positions 1,4 are H, P. Both allowed.

But ""HARPY"" is a valid word.

However, let’s double-check: H, A, R, P, Y – none of the forbidden letters are used.

Another option: ""MARRY"" – but R is duplicated.

Let’s go with ""HARPY"" as it introduces new common consonants H and P.

But wait, position 4 must be a consonant since positions 2,3,5 are A,R,Y. So H A R P Y – position 4 is P, which is allowed.

But is HARPY a valid word? Yes.

However, let me think of a more common word. ""FARCY"" isn’t valid. ""CARNY"" is slang.

Let’s try ""BARKY"" – B, A, R, K, Y – positions 1,4: B, K. Both allowed.

""BARKY"" is a valid word.

But let me think of the most common word: ""FARCY"" no, ""CARNY"" no, ""BARKY"" yes.

Alternatively, ""GARBY"" – but G, B allowed, but ""GARBY"" is valid.

But ""BARKY"" is more common.

Let me go with ""BARKY"".

<guess>BARKY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RIVAL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) V(x) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: TARDY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: BARKY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on BARKY:
- B(✓) → B is in position 1.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2.
- R(✓) → R is in position 3.
- K(x) → K is NOT in the word.
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
B A R _ Y

We only need to determine position 4.  
Forbidden letters so far: O, S, E, I, V, L, T, D, K  
Allowed remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

Position 4 must be a single letter from the allowed set.  
Common English 5-letter words fitting B A R _ Y:

- B A R C Y → “BARCY” – not a valid word.
- B A R F Y → “BARFY” – not valid.
- B A R G Y → “BARGY” – not valid.
- B A R H Y → “BARHY” – not valid.
- B A R J Y → “BARJY” – not valid.
- B A R M Y → “BARMY” – valid (Australian English variant, but recognized).
- B A R N Y → “BARNY” – not valid.
- B A R P Y → “BARPY” – not valid.
- B A R Q Y → “BARQY” – not valid.
- B A R W Y → “BARWY” – not valid.
- B A R X Y → “BARXY” – not valid.
- B A R Z Y → “BARZ Y” – not valid.

The only valid word is “BARMY”.

Thus, the secret word must be BARMY.
