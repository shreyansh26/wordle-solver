For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S and E in different positions and avoids A, R, O. I’ll try to probe more common letters while placing S and E in new spots.

A good next word might be ""STEIN"":
- Uses S (moved to position 1) and E (moved to position 2), both common vowels/consonants.
- Avoids A, R, O entirely.
- Introduces T, I, N to test new letters.

From the latest feedback on SNELL:
- S(✓) – position 1 is definitely S.
- E(✓) – position 3 is definitely E.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word (we already knew position 4 and 5 couldn’t be L).

So far we have:
- Pattern: S _ E _ _
- N must appear in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2 and 1,3 are taken).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I, L.

We need a word that:
- Starts with S, has E in position 3.
- Contains N in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only remaining allowed letters.

Let’s try S _ E N _ first (N in position 4). That leaves position 2 and 5 to fill, avoiding excluded letters.

Good candidates for position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Good candidates for position 5: same pool, but must also accommodate N in position 4.

A strong choice is “SHEEN”:
- S(✓) position 1, E(✓) position 3, N(✓) position 4.
- H and second E are tests for new letters.

Another candidate is “SPEEN” (but P isn’t strongly indicated). “SHEEN” seems best for narrowing down remaining letters.

Let’s verify:
- SHEEN: S(✓) H _ E N _ → but position 3 must be E, so this would be S H E N _. That’s 5 letters: S H E N _, which fits S _ E _ _ and uses H and N in new positions. Actually, that’s 5 letters total: S H E N _, so positions 1-5: S, H, E, N, ?. But we need 5 letters total: S H E N _ doesn’t end with a letter. So “SHEEN” is 5 letters: S H E E N, but that has E twice, which is allowed, but we already know E is in position 3. So “SHEEN” would be S H E E N, which has E in 3 and 4, but we only know E is definitely in 3. The second E in 4 is a risk.

Alternative: S _ E _ N (N in position 5). That leaves position 2 to fill. Good candidate: C → “SCEAN” (but A is excluded), so not C. D → “SDEAN” (A excluded), so no. G → “SGEN_” – no. M → “SMELN” – not a word. P → “SPEND” – D and N are allowed, but we already used N in position 4 in SNELL and it was marked wrong position, so N can’t be in 4. Thus N must be in 5.

So pattern: S _ E _ N

Candidate: S P E C N – but C is okay, but “SPECN” isn’t a word.  
S M E L N – L is excluded.  
S M E C N – not a word.

“SMERN” – not a word.  
“SMELN” – invalid.

Let’s try S _ E N _ instead (N in position 4). Then position 2 and 5 are filled with new letters.

S K E N D – “SKEND” isn’t a word.

- S C E N D – no.  
- S H E N D – no.

- S C E N K – “SCENK” isn’t a word.  
- S H E N K – “SHENK” isn’t a word.  
- S P E N D – no.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I should try N in position 2 instead, but position 2 is after S and E. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the pattern is S _ E _ _, and N must be in position 4 or 5. The word must be S _ E N _ or S _ E _ N.

Looking at S _ E N _:
- S M E N _ – “SMELN” invalid.  
- S C E N _ – “SCENT” – but T is excluded.  
- S H E N _ – “SHEND” invalid.  
- S K E N _ – “SKENE” – E already in 3.  
- S P E N _ – “SPEND” – D okay, but “SPEND” is 5 letters: S P E N D, but position 4 is N, which is allowed. Actually, “SPEND” is S P E N D, which fits S _ E _ N (N in 4), so positions 1-5: S, P, E, N, D. This is valid.

Let me check “SPEND”:
- S(✓) position 1, P(new), E(✓) position 3, N(✓) position 4, D(new). This tests P and D.

Another candidate: S M E N _ – “SMELN” invalid.  
S C E N _ – “SCENT” – T excluded.  
S H E N _ – “SHEND” – invalid.  
S K E N _ – “SKENE” – valid, but uses K and E twice.  
“SKENE” – S K E N E – position 3 E is correct, N is in 4 (allowed), K and E are new. But E is already known in 3, so second E in 5 is allowed. But we already know E is in 3, so second E in 5 is risky.

“SKENE” is valid (means “skin” in Greek, accepted in English dictionaries).

But “SPEND” is more common.

I’ll go with “SPEND” to test P and D.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S and E in different positions and avoids A, R, O. I’ll try to probe more common letters while placing S and E in new spots.

A good next word might be ""STEIN"":
- Uses S (moved to position 1) and E (moved to position 2), both common vowels/consonants.
- Avoids A, R, O entirely.
- Introduces T, I, N to test new letters.

<guess>STEIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is S.
- E is in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is E.
- T and I are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → N is somewhere, just not position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ E _ _
- Contains: S, E, N (but not in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, T, I

I need a word that fits S _ E _ _, uses N somewhere in positions 2 or 4, and avoids all excluded letters.

Possible N positions:
- If N is in position 2: S N E _ _
- If N is in position 4: S _ E N _

Let's try SNELL:
- SNELL fits S N E _ _ pattern (both Ns are allowed).
- Uses L (new letter) in positions 4 and 5 to test additional letters.
- Avoids all known exclusions.

Another candidate could be SPEND (but D isn't strongly indicated), or SNEAK (but A is excluded). SNELL seems best for testing new letters efficiently.

<guess>SNELL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)
Guess 3: SNELL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(-) E(✓) L(x) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on SNELL:
- S(✓) – position 1 is definitely S.
- E(✓) – position 3 is definitely E.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word (we already knew position 4 and 5 couldn’t be L).

So far we have:
- Pattern: S _ E _ _
- N must appear in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2 and 1,3 are taken).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I, L.

We need a word that:
- Starts with S, has E in position 3.
- Contains N in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only remaining allowed letters.

Let’s try S _ E N _ first (N in position 4). That leaves position 2 and 5 to fill, avoiding excluded letters.

Good candidates for position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Good candidates for position 5: same pool, but must also accommodate N in position 4.

A strong choice is “SHEEN”:
- S(✓) position 1, E(✓) position 3, N(✓) position 4.
- H and second E are tests for new letters.

Another candidate is “SPEEN” (but P isn’t strongly indicated). “SHEEN” seems best for narrowing down remaining letters.

Let’s verify:
- SHEEN: S(✓) H _ E N _ → but position 3 must be E, so this would be S H E N _. That’s 5 letters: S H E N _, which fits S _ E _ _ and uses H and N in new positions. Actually, that’s 5 letters total: S H E N _, so positions 1-5: S, H, E, N, ?. But we need 5 letters total: S H E N _ doesn’t end with a letter. So “SHEEN” is 5 letters: S H E E N, but that has E twice, which is allowed, but we already know E is in position 3. So “SHEEN” would be S H E E N, which has E in 3 and 4, but we only know E is definitely in 3. The second E in 4 is a risk.

Alternative: S _ E _ N (N in position 5). That leaves position 2 to fill. Good candidate: C → “SCEAN” (but A is excluded), so not C. D → “SDEAN” (A excluded), so no. G → “SGEN_” – no. M → “SMELN” – not a word. P → “SPEND” – D and N are allowed, but we already used N in position 4 in SNELL and it was marked wrong position, so N can’t be in 4. Thus N must be in 5.

So pattern: S _ E _ N

Candidate: S P E C N – but C is okay, but “SPECN” isn’t a word.  
S M E L N – L is excluded.  
S M E C N – not a word.  
S M E D N – not a word.  
S M E N N – duplicate N, but N is allowed.  
Actually, “SMELN” isn’t valid, but “SMELT” is 5 letters: S M E L T, but T is excluded.  
“SMERN” – not a word.  
“SMELN” – invalid.  
“SMELT” – T excluded.  
“SMELN” – invalid.

Let’s try S _ E N _ instead (N in position 4). Then position 2 and 5 are filled with new letters.

Candidate: S P E N D – “SPEND” isn’t a word.  
S M E N D – “SMEND” isn’t a word.  
S C E N D – “SCEND” isn’t a word.  
S H E N D – “SHEND” isn’t a word.  
S K E N D – “SKEND” isn’t a word.  
S M E N D – invalid.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting S _ E N _:
- S P E N D – no.  
- S M E N D – no.  
- S C E N D – no.  
- S H E N D – no.  
- S K E N D – no.  
- S P E N K – “SPENK” isn’t a word.  
- S M E N K – “SMENK” isn’t a word.  
- S C E N K – “SCENK” isn’t a word.  
- S H E N K – “SHENK” isn’t a word.  
- S P E N D – no.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I should try N in position 2 instead, but position 2 is after S and E. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the pattern is S _ E _ _, and N must be in position 4 or 5. The word must be S _ E N _ or S _ E _ N.

Looking at S _ E N _:
- S M E N _ – “SMELN” invalid.  
- S C E N _ – “SCENT” – but T is excluded.  
- S H E N _ – “SHEND” invalid.  
- S K E N _ – “SKENE” – E already in 3.  
- S P E N _ – “SPEND” – D okay, but “SPEND” is 5 letters: S P E N D, but position 4 is N, which is allowed. Actually, “SPEND” is S P E N D, which fits S _ E _ N (N in 4), so positions 1-5: S, P, E, N, D. This is valid.

Let me check “SPEND”:
- S(✓) position 1, P(new), E(✓) position 3, N(✓) position 4, D(new). This tests P and D.

Another candidate: S M E N _ – “SMELN” invalid.  
S C E N _ – “SCENT” – T excluded.  
S H E N _ – “SHEND” – invalid.  
S K E N _ – “SKENE” – valid, but uses K and E twice.  
“SKENE” – S K E N E – position 3 E is correct, N is in 4 (allowed), K and E are new. But E is already known in 3, so second E in 5 is allowed. But we already know E is in 3, so second E in 5 is risky.

“SKENE” is valid (means “skin” in Greek, accepted in English dictionaries).

But “SPEND” is more common.

I’ll go with “SPEND” to test P and D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S and E in different positions and avoids A, R, O. I’ll try to probe more common letters while placing S and E in new spots.

A good next word might be ""STEIN"":
- Uses S (moved to position 1) and E (moved to position 2), both common vowels/consonants.
- Avoids A, R, O entirely.
- Introduces T, I, N to test new letters.

<guess>STEIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is S.
- E is in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is E.
- T and I are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → N is somewhere, just not position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ E _ _
- Contains: S, E, N (but not in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, T, I

I need a word that fits S _ E _ _, uses N somewhere in positions 2 or 4, and avoids all excluded letters.

Possible N positions:
- If N is in position 2: S N E _ _
- If N is in position 4: S _ E N _

Let's try SNELL:
- SNELL fits S N E _ _ pattern (both Ns are allowed).
- Uses L (new letter) in positions 4 and 5 to test additional letters.
- Avoids all known exclusions.

Another candidate could be SPEND (but D isn't strongly indicated), or SNEAK (but A is excluded). SNELL seems best for testing new letters efficiently.

Guess 3: SNELL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(-) E(✓) L(x) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on SNELL:
- S(✓) – position 1 is definitely S.
- E(✓) – position 3 is definitely E.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word (we already knew position 4 and 5 couldn’t be L).

So far we have:
- Pattern: S _ E _ _
- N must appear in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2 and 1,3 are taken).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I, L.

We need a word that:
- Starts with S, has E in position 3.
- Contains N in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only remaining allowed letters.

Let’s try S _ E N _ first (N in position 4). That leaves position 2 and 5 to fill, avoiding excluded letters.

Good candidates for position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Good candidates for position 5: same pool, but must also accommodate N in position 4.

A strong choice is “SHEEN”:
- S(✓) position 1, E(✓) position 3, N(✓) position 4.
- H and second E are tests for new letters.

Another candidate is “SPEEN” (but P isn’t strongly indicated). “SHEEN” seems best for narrowing down remaining letters.

Let’s verify:
- SHEEN: S(✓) H _ E N _ → but position 3 must be E, so this would be S H E N _. That’s 5 letters: S H E N _, which fits S _ E _ _ and uses H and N in new positions. Actually, that’s 5 letters total: S H E N _, so positions 1-5: S, H, E, N, ?. But we need 5 letters total: S H E N _ doesn’t end with a letter. So “SHEEN” is 5 letters: S H E E N, but that has E twice, which is allowed, but we already know E is in position 3. So “SHEEN” would be S H E E N, which has E in 3 and 4, but we only know E is definitely in 3. The second E in 4 is a risk.

Alternative: S _ E _ N (N in position 5). That leaves position 2 to fill. Good candidate: C → “SCEAN” (but A is excluded), so not C. D → “SDEAN” (A excluded), so no. G → “SGEN_” – no. M → “SMELN” – not a word. P → “SPEND” – D and N are allowed, but we already used N in position 4 in SNELL and it was marked wrong position, so N can’t be in 4. Thus N must be in 5.

So pattern: S _ E _ N

Candidate: S P E C N – but C is okay, but “SPECN” isn’t a word.  
S M E L N – L is excluded.  
S M E C N – not a word.  
S M E D N – not a word.  
S M E N N – duplicate N, but N is allowed.  
Actually, “SMELN” isn’t valid, but “SMELT” is 5 letters: S M E L T, but T is excluded.  
“SMERN” – not a word.  
“SMELN” – invalid.  
“SMELT” – T excluded.  
“SMELN” – invalid.

Let’s try S _ E N _ instead (N in position 4). Then position 2 and 5 are filled with new letters.

Candidate: S P E N D – “SPEND” isn’t a word.  
S M E N D – “SMEND” isn’t a word.  
S C E N D – “SCEND” isn’t a word.  
S H E N D – “SHEND” isn’t a word.  
S K E N D – “SKEND” isn’t a word.  
S M E N D – invalid.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting S _ E N _:
- S P E N D – no.  
- S M E N D – no.  
- S C E N D – no.  
- S H E N D – no.  
- S K E N D – no.  
- S P E N K – “SPENK” isn’t a word.  
- S M E N K – “SMENK” isn’t a word.  
- S C E N K – “SCENK” isn’t a word.  
- S H E N K – “SHENK” isn’t a word.  
- S P E N D – no.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I should try N in position 2 instead, but position 2 is after S and E. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the pattern is S _ E _ _, and N must be in position 4 or 5. The word must be S _ E N _ or S _ E _ N.

Looking at S _ E N _:
- S M E N _ – “SMELN” invalid.  
- S C E N _ – “SCENT” – but T is excluded.  
- S H E N _ – “SHEND” invalid.  
- S K E N _ – “SKENE” – E already in 3.  
- S P E N _ – “SPEND” – D okay, but “SPEND” is 5 letters: S P E N D, but position 4 is N, which is allowed. Actually, “SPEND” is S P E N D, which fits S _ E _ N (N in 4), so positions 1-5: S, P, E, N, D. This is valid.

Let me check “SPEND”:
- S(✓) position 1, P(new), E(✓) position 3, N(✓) position 4, D(new). This tests P and D.

Another candidate: S M E N _ – “SMELN” invalid.  
S C E N _ – “SCENT” – T excluded.  
S H E N _ – “SHEND” – invalid.  
S K E N _ – “SKENE” – valid, but uses K and E twice.  
“SKENE” – S K E N E – position 3 E is correct, N is in 4 (allowed), K and E are new. But E is already known in 3, so second E in 5 is allowed. But we already know E is in 3, so second E in 5 is risky.

“SKENE” is valid (means “skin” in Greek, accepted in English dictionaries).

But “SPEND” is more common.

I’ll go with “SPEND” to test P and D.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 4: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(✓) N(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on SPEND:
- S(✓) – position 1 is S.
- E(✓) – position 3 is E.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it can’t be in 2, 1, 3).
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So:
- Pattern: S _ E _ _
- N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 2, 1, 3, 4).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D.

Thus the word must be: S _ E _ N

Position 2 must be a letter not yet used and not excluded. Available letters (excluding A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, and already used S, E, N):
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words of the form S ? E ? N:
- S M E C N – invalid.  
- S M E D N – D excluded.  
- S M E L N – L excluded.  
- S K E E N – invalid.  
- S H E E N – invalid.  
- S C E N N – invalid.  
- S M E N N – valid (means “smell” in English, but “smell” is 5 letters: S M E L L, but L is excluded). Actually “SMELN” is invalid.  
- S M E N _ – “SMEN_” – no.  
- S M E _ N – “SMELN” invalid.  
- S C E _ N – “SCEAN” – A excluded.  
- S K E _ N – “SKEN_” – no.  
- S H E _ N – “SHEN_” – no.  
- S M E _ N – “SMELN” invalid.  
- S M E N N – invalid (L excluded).  
- S M E C N – invalid.  
- S M E D N – invalid (D excluded).  
- S M E L N – invalid (L excluded).  

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be S _ E _ N with N at 5. So position 2 is the only unknown, and position 4 must be a new letter.

Valid words:
- S M E C N – invalid.  
- S M E D N – invalid.  
- S M E L N – invalid.  
- S K E E N – invalid.  
- S H E E N – invalid.  
- S C E N N – invalid.  
- S M E N N – invalid.  

Actually, let me check “SMELT” – but T is excluded.  

Let me list all possible S ? E ? N words avoiding excluded letters:

Excluded letters: A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D.

Possible letters for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible letters for position 4: same pool, but must form a valid word.

Looking at common words:
- S M E C N – no.  
- S M E D N – no.  
- S M E L N – no.  
- S K E E N – no.  
- S H E E N – no.  
- S C E N N – no.  
- S M E N N – no.  

Wait, let me try “SMELT” – but T is excluded.  

Actually, the only common 5-letter word fitting S _ E _ N is “SMELT” (but T excluded), “SMELN” invalid, “SMELK” invalid.  

Let me check “SKEEN” – but not a word.  

I’m missing something. Let me re-examine:

We have: S _ E _ N, with N at 5.

Valid words:
- S M E C N – no.  
- S M E D N – no.  
- S M E L N – no.  
- S K E E N – no.  
- S H E E N – no.  
- S C E N N – no.  
- S M E N N – no.  

The only valid English word fitting S _ E _ N is “SMELT” (but T excluded).  

This suggests I might have missed a word. Let me think differently: “SKEEN” is invalid.  

Wait, let me check “SHEEN” – but E is already in 3.  

I realize I might have missed “SHEEN” (sheen). Let me check if it fits:
- S H E E N – position 3 is E, position 4 is E, position 5 is N. This fits S _ E _ N.  

Letters used: S, H, E, E, N.  
- H is new.  
- E is already known in 3.  
- N is known in 5.  

This seems valid.  

Let me verify:
- S H E E N – positions: S(✓) H _ E E N, but E is already in 3, so position 4 must be E, which is allowed.  
- N is in 5, which is allowed (since N can’t be in 2,1,3,4).  

This is the best available option.

From the latest feedback on SHEEN:
- S(✓) – position 1 is S.
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – position 3 is E.
- E(✓) – second E is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know E is in position 3, but the word might have another E).
- N(✓) – position 5 is N.

So the pattern is: S _ E E N

This tells us:
- Position 2 must be E (since position 3 is E and we already have E in position 4). But this would make the word S E E N _, which is 5 letters: S E E N _. Let me check this:

Actually, the pattern is S (position 1), then E (position 2), then E (position 3), then N (position 4), but position 4 is N which was marked wrong in SPEND (position 4). So N cannot be in position 4. Thus N must be in position 5, making the word S _ E E N. But position 2 must be E, so S E E N _ is 5 letters: S E E N _. 

Wait, let me re-express:

Thus the word is S _ E _ N with N at 5. But position 2 must be E, so the word is S E E _ N. But position 4 cannot be N (from SPEND feedback), and we have no restriction on position 4 being another letter.

Valid words:
- S M E A N – A excluded.  
- S M E C N – invalid.  
- S M E D N – D excluded.  
- S M E L N – L excluded.  
- S M E N N – invalid.  
- S K E E N – invalid.  
- S C E E N – invalid.  
- S M E E N – invalid.  

Actually, the only valid English word fitting S _ E _ N is “SMELT” (but T is excluded).  

Wait, let me check “SKEEN” – but K and N are allowed.  

But “SKEEN” is 5 letters: S K E E N. Let me check if this fits all constraints:
- S(✓) K, E(✓) E(✓), N(✓).  
- Letters used: S, K, E, E, N.  
- K is new.  
- E is already known in 3.  
- N is known in 5.  

This seems valid.  

But let me verify:
- S K E E N – positions: S(✓) K _ E E N, but we already have E in 3 and another E in 4. This is acceptable.  

Thus, the next guess is “SKEEN”.

<guess>SKEEN</guess>",SKEEN,"From the latest feedback on SHEEN:
- S(✓) – position 1 is S.
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – position 3 is E.
- E(✓) – second E is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know E is in position 3, but the word might have another E).
- N(✓) – position 5 is N.

So the pattern is: S _ E E N

This tells us:
- Position 2 must be E (since position 3 is E and we already have E in position 4). But this would make the word S E E N _, which is 5 letters: S E E N _. Let me check this:

Actually, the pattern is S (position 1), then E (position 2), then E (position 3), then N (position 4), but position 4 is N which was marked wrong in SPEND (position 4). So N cannot be in position 4. Thus N must be in position 5, making the word S _ E E N. But position 2 must be E, so S E E N _ is 5 letters: S E E N _. 

Wait, let me re-express:
Current knowns:
- S(✓) position 1
- E(✓) position 3
- N(✓) position 5
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, H

Thus the word is S _ E _ N with N at 5. But position 2 must be E, so the word is S E E _ N. But position 4 cannot be N (from SPEND feedback), and we have no restriction on position 4 being another letter.

Valid words:
- S M E A N – A excluded.  
- S M E C N – invalid.  
- S M E D N – D excluded.  
- S M E L N – L excluded.  
- S M E N N – invalid.  
- S K E E N – invalid.  
- S C E E N – invalid.  
- S M E E N – invalid.  

Actually, the only valid English word fitting S _ E _ N is “SMELT” (but T is excluded).  

Wait, let me check “SKEEN” – but K and N are allowed.  

But “SKEEN” is 5 letters: S K E E N. Let me check if this fits all constraints:
- S(✓) K, E(✓) E(✓), N(✓).  
- Letters used: S, K, E, E, N.  
- K is new.  
- E is already known in 3.  
- N is known in 5.  

This seems valid.  

But let me verify:
- S K E E N – positions: S(✓) K _ E E N, but we already have E in 3 and another E in 4. This is acceptable.  

Thus, the next guess is “SKEEN”.",Guess 6: SKEEN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) E(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
