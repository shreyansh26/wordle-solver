For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like ""SLIMY"" would include S but not in position 4, and use other common letters. However, ""Y"" might be too uncommon. ""STING"" uses S plus common letters, but has N and G which weren't tested yet. 

Let me try ""SLIMY"" to test S in position 1, and the letters L, I, M, Y.

<guess>SLIMY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLIMY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)  
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
   - L, M are not in the word.  
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I _ _  (I fixed in position 3)
- Must contain S and Y, but S ≠ 1 and Y ≠ 5.
- Must not contain: A, R, O, E, L, M.

Remaining common consonants: N, T, C, D, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (only one left).

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and Y in position 4, and uses N for the remaining consonant:  
N S I Y _  → “NSIY_” is invalid, but “N” “S” “I” “Y” “?” forms “NSIY” + ?.  
Actually, we need a 5-letter word with _ _ I _ _ , containing S and Y, avoiding A,R,O,E,L,M.

A good candidate: “USING”  
- U (vowel)  
- S (must be somewhere)  
- I (fixed in pos 3)  
- N (consonant)  
- G (consonant)  

Checking:  
- Does not contain forbidden letters.  
- Contains S and Y.  
- S is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Y is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is correctly placed in 3.  

This should efficiently narrow down the remaining letters.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)

   – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   – S is still not in position 1.

3. USING → U(x) S(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)  
   – I still ✓ in position 3.  
   – N is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  
   – S is still in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ I N _  
Letters still required: S (somewhere else), plus any other consonants/vowels not yet ruled out.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, L, M, U, G.

Remaining common letters: S, S must go in 1 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
But S cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE and USING feedback).  
Therefore S must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ _ I N S

Only the first two letters remain to be found, and they must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z (minus any already excluded).

Looking for common English 5-letter words ending in “IN S”:

- S in position 5 ✓.  
- No forbidden letters.

The only remaining plausible 5-letter word that fits _ _ I N S and uses only allowed letters is “FINES”, but E is forbidden.  
Next, check “PINEYS” – but E and Y are allowed, yet E is forbidden.  
Realize that no standard 5-letter English word fits _ _ I N S except “FINES” which is disqualified.

However, there is “FINES” but E is forbidden, so discard.

Re-examine allowed letters more carefully.  
The only letters left that can appear in positions 1 or 2 are from: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, V, X, Y, Z.

A valid word must be recorded.  
Actually, “FINES” is invalid (E).  
“DINGY” – but G is forbidden.  
“PINKY” – K and Y are allowed, and P, I, N, K, Y all fit.  
Check constraints:  
- P, I, N, K, Y.  
- I in 3, N in 4, S in 5 ✓.  
- No forbidden letters.  
- S is in position 5 ✓.  
- Y is in position 2 (allowed).  
- P and K are new letters but must be accepted.

Therefore “PINKY” is the only remaining candidate that satisfies every constraint.

But wait – “PINKY” has I in position 3, N in 4, K in 2, Y in 5, P in 1.  
Actually, that would be P I N K Y – but we need _ _ I N S.  
So positions are reversed: last letter must be S, so we need _ _ I N S.

Hence the word must be “PINKS” – but that’s 5 letters and P, I, N, K, S fit:  
- P (pos 1) – allowed.  
- I (pos 3) – ✓.  
- N (pos 4) – ✓.  
- S (pos 5) – ✓.  
- K (pos 2) – allowed.  

And “PINKS” is a valid English word meaning “a pink,” so it’s acceptable.

Therefore, the final guess is PINKS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like ""SLIMY"" would include S but not in position 4, and use other common letters. However, ""Y"" might be too uncommon. ""STING"" uses S plus common letters, but has N and G which weren't tested yet. 

Let me try ""SLIMY"" to test S in position 1, and the letters L, I, M, Y.

<guess>SLIMY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLIMY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)  
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
   - L, M are not in the word.  
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I _ _  (I fixed in position 3)
- Must contain S and Y, but S ≠ 1 and Y ≠ 5.
- Must not contain: A, R, O, E, L, M.

Remaining common consonants: N, T, C, D, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (only one left).

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and Y in position 4, and uses N for the remaining consonant:  
N S I Y _  → “NSIY_” is invalid, but “N” “S” “I” “Y” “?” forms “NSIY” + ?.  
Actually, we need a 5-letter word with _ _ I _ _ , containing S and Y, avoiding A,R,O,E,L,M.

A good candidate: “USING”  
- U (vowel)  
- S (must be somewhere)  
- I (fixed in pos 3)  
- N (consonant)  
- G (consonant)  

Checking:  
- Does not contain forbidden letters.  
- Contains S and Y.  
- S is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Y is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is correctly placed in 3.  

This should efficiently narrow down the remaining letters.

Guess 3: USING -> FEEDBACK: U(x) S(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)  
   – I is in position 3 (✓).  
   – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   – S is still not in position 1.

3. USING → U(x) S(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)  
   – I still ✓ in position 3.  
   – N is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  
   – S is still in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ I N _  
Letters still required: S (somewhere else), plus any other consonants/vowels not yet ruled out.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, L, M, U, G.

Remaining common letters: S, S must go in 1 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
But S cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE and USING feedback).  
Therefore S must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ _ I N S

Only the first two letters remain to be found, and they must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z (minus any already excluded).

Looking for common English 5-letter words ending in “IN S”:

- “WIN S” – invalid, only 4 letters.  
- “FIN S” – invalid.  
- “TWINS” – but W and T are allowed, and it’s a valid 5-letter word.  

Check “TWINS” against all constraints:
- T, W, I, N, S.  
- I in position 3 ✓.  
- N in position 4 ✓.  
- S in position 5 ✓.  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore “TWINS” is the logical next guess.

From all feedback so far:

   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(-)  
   – I is locked in position 3 (✓).  
   – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   – S is still not in position 1.

3. USING → U(x) S(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)

   – S is still in the word but NOT in position 2.

4. TWINS → T(x) W(x) I(✓) N(✓) S(✓)  
   – All four letters I, N, S are now ✓ in their exact positions.  
   – T and W are NOT in the word.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ I N S

We only need the first two letters.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, L, M, U, G, T, W.  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, V, X, Y, Z.  
Vowels left: none that haven’t been ruled out (only I is allowed).

Look for a valid 5-letter English word of the form ??INS.  
Common candidates:  
- “FINS” – only 4 letters.  
- “DINS” – invalid.  
- “HINS” – invalid.  
- “PINS” – invalid.  
- “BINS” – invalid.  
- “VINS” – invalid.  
- “KINS” – invalid.  
- “ZINS” – invalid.  

The only remaining plausible 5-letter word that fits _ _ I N S and uses only allowed letters is “FINES”, but E is forbidden.  
Next, check “PINEYS” – but E and Y are allowed, yet E is forbidden.  
Realize that no standard 5-letter English word fits _ _ I N S except “FINES” which is disqualified.

However, there is “FINES” but E is forbidden, so discard.

Re-examine allowed letters more carefully.  
The only letters left that can appear in positions 1 or 2 are from: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, V, X, Y, Z.

A valid word must be recorded.  
Actually, “FINES” is invalid (E).  
“DINGY” – but G is forbidden.  
“PINKY” – K and Y are allowed, and P, I, N, K, Y all fit.  
Check constraints:  
- P, I, N, K, Y.  
- I in 3, N in 4, S in 5 ✓.  
- No forbidden letters.  
- S is in position 5 ✓.  
- Y is in position 2 (allowed).  
- P and K are new letters but must be accepted.

Therefore “PINKY” is the only remaining candidate that satisfies every constraint.

But wait – “PINKY” has I in position 3, N in 4, K in 2, Y in 5, P in 1.  
Actually, that would be P I N K Y – but we need _ _ I N S.  
So positions are reversed: last letter must be S, so we need _ _ I N S.

Hence the word must be “PINKS” – but that’s 5 letters and P, I, N, K, S fit:  
- P (pos 1) – allowed.  
- I (pos 3) – ✓.  
- N (pos 4) – ✓.  
- S (pos 5) – ✓.  
- K (pos 2) – allowed.  

And “PINKS” is a valid English word meaning “a pink,” so it’s acceptable.

Therefore, the final guess is PINKS.

From all feedback:

Confirmed positions:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: S

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, L, M, U, G, T, W, K

Revised constraints:
- Word pattern: P _ I N S
- Letters allowed in position 2: Any remaining letters except those already ruled out.
- We must also consider that P, I, N, S are already placed correctly, so we need a valid 5-letter word of the form P ? I N S.

Valid English words fitting P _ I N S:
- PINES – but E is forbidden.
- PINS – only 4 letters.
- PIVINS – invalid.
- PAMINS – A is forbidden.
- PAINS – A is forbidden.
- PFINS – invalid.
- PHINS – invalid.
- PJINS – invalid.
- PKINS – K is forbidden.
- PVINS – invalid.
- PYINS – Y is allowed in position 2.

Check PYINS:
- P (✓) Y (allowed) I (✓) N (✓) S (✓)
- No forbidden letters.
- Meets every constraint.

Thus, the only remaining candidate is PYINS.
