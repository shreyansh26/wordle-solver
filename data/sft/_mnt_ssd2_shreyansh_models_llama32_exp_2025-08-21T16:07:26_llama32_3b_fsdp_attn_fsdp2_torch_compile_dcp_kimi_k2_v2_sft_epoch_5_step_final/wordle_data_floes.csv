For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), S, E
- S and E are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, but they could be in other positions.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5 for S and E respectively)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 4, since it was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but position 2 is O, so 1, 3, 4)

Let me think of words that fit _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere. Some possibilities:
- DOSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong for S and E)
- BOSES (but double S, and we don't know if S is duplicated)
- COSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong)
- FOIST (but this has an F, and we're not sure about F)
- LOUSE (but this has an L, and we're not sure about L)
- MOUSE (but M is uncertain)
- POISE (but this has an I and N, and we're not sure about I and N)
- TOILE (but has an T and L, and I is uncertain)
- VOILE (but V is uncertain)
- WORSE (but R is excluded)
- YODEL (but has an Y and D, and L is uncertain)

Looking at these, ""FOIST"" seems plausible:
- F: not sure, but let's check
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (but S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, S can't be in position 4.

Next option: ""LOUSE""
- L: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid again)
Not good.

""MOUSE"":
- M: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""POISE"":
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""VOILE"":
- V: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so invalid)

""TOILE"":
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

Hmm, most words with this pattern have S in position 4 which we know is wrong. Let me think differently - S must be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
- S in position 1: S O _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ O S _ _
- S in position 5: _ O _ _ S

And E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""SOBER"":
- S: position 1 (valid, since S was in position 4 before and marked wrong)
- O: position 2 ✓
- B: not sure
- E: position 4 (valid, since E was in position 5 before and marked wrong)
- R: but R is excluded from the word (from feedback)

""SOAKS"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- A: excluded
- K: not sure
- S: position 5 (but S can't be in position 4, but can be in 1 and 5 - but we have S in position 1 and 5, but that's okay for the game)

But ""SOAKS"" has A which is excluded.

""SONIC"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- I: not sure
- C: not sure
But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

""SONES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5
But this has two S's, and we don't know if S is duplicated.

""SOFTY"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- F: not sure
- T: not sure
- Y: not sure
But this lacks E.

""SOKEE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 4
- E: position 5 (but E can't be in position 5)

""SOKEE"" is invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLEM"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

This seems plausible - all letters are new and fit the constraints.

Another option: ""SOGIE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- G: not sure
- I: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOHME"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- H: not sure
- M: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOKEE"" was invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This is similar to ""SOLEM"", but ""SOLES"" has an S in position 1 and 5 - but the feedback didn't say S can't be in position 5 (only that S was wrong in position 4). So this might be valid.

But looking back, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1, 3, or 5. There's no restriction on S being in position 5.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 1 and 5 - but we don't know if S is duplicated.

Another option: ""SPOKE"":
- S: position 1
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STOLE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STONE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOFTY"" lacks E.

""SOKEE"" has E in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 5).

""SOLEM"" seems the best available:
- S: position 1 (valid)
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

But let me think of words with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 4, and has S in 5 which is allowed)

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 - position 4 is invalid for S, and position 5 is valid.

Wait, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S cannot be in position 4. There's no restriction on S being in position 1, 3, or 5.

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid).

""BOSES"":
- B: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)

This has S in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is allowed for S.

""BOSES"" seems possible.

But let me think of simpler words.

""FOIST"" lacks E.

""LOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""POISE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""VOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""TOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""MOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""HOSES"":
- H: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This fits all constraints.

""HOSES"" has:
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)
- H: not sure, but that's fine

This seems like the best next guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback that O is correctly placed at position 2, and S and E are in the word but not in their previous positions (4 and 5 respectively), I'll try a word that places O fixed, and tries S and E in new positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), S, E
- S and E are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, but they could be in other positions.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5 for S and E respectively)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 4, since it was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but position 2 is O, so 1, 3, 4)

Let me think of words that fit _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere. Some possibilities:
- DOSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong for S and E)
- BOSES (but double S, and we don't know if S is duplicated)
- COSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong)
- FOIST (but this has an F, and we're not sure about F)
- LOUSE (but this has an L, and we're not sure about L)
- MOUSE (but M is uncertain)
- POISE (but this has an I and N, and we're not sure about I and N)
- TOILE (but has an T and L, and I is uncertain)
- VOILE (but V is uncertain)
- WORSE (but R is excluded)
- YODEL (but has an Y and D, and L is uncertain)

Looking at these, ""FOIST"" seems plausible:
- F: not sure, but let's check
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (but S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, S can't be in position 4.

Next option: ""LOUSE""
- L: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid again)
Not good.

""MOUSE"":
- M: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""POISE"":
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""VOILE"":
- V: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so invalid)

""TOILE"":
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

Hmm, most words with this pattern have S in position 4 which we know is wrong. Let me think differently - S must be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
- S in position 1: S O _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ O S _ _
- S in position 5: _ O _ _ S

And E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""SOBER"":
- S: position 1 (valid, since S was in position 4 before and marked wrong)
- O: position 2 ✓
- B: not sure
- E: position 4 (valid, since E was in position 5 before and marked wrong)
- R: but R is excluded from the word (from feedback)

""SOAKS"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- A: excluded
- K: not sure
- S: position 5 (but S can't be in position 4, but can be in 1 and 5 - but we have S in position 1 and 5, but that's okay for the game)

But ""SOAKS"" has A which is excluded.

""SONIC"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- I: not sure
- C: not sure
But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

""SONES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5
But this has two S's, and we don't know if S is duplicated.

""SOFTY"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- F: not sure
- T: not sure
- Y: not sure
But this lacks E.

""SOKEE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 4
- E: position 5 (but E can't be in position 5)

""SOKEE"" is invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLEM"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

This seems plausible - all letters are new and fit the constraints.

Another option: ""SOGIE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- G: not sure
- I: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOHME"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- H: not sure
- M: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOKEE"" was invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This is similar to ""SOLEM"", but ""SOLES"" has an S in position 1 and 5 - but the feedback didn't say S can't be in position 5 (only that S was wrong in position 4). So this might be valid.

But looking back, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1, 3, or 5. There's no restriction on S being in position 5.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 1 and 5 - but we don't know if S is duplicated.

Another option: ""SPOKE"":
- S: position 1
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STOLE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STONE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOFTY"" lacks E.

""SOKEE"" has E in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 5).

""SOLEM"" seems the best available:
- S: position 1 (valid)
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

But let me think of words with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 4, and has S in 5 which is allowed)

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 - position 4 is invalid for S, and position 5 is valid.

Wait, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S cannot be in position 4. There's no restriction on S being in position 1, 3, or 5.

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid).

""BOSES"":
- B: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)

This has S in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is allowed for S.

""BOSES"" seems possible.

But let me think of simpler words.

""FOIST"" lacks E.

""LOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""POISE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""VOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""TOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""MOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""HOSES"":
- H: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This fits all constraints.

""HOSES"" has:
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)
- H: not sure, but that's fine

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback that O is correctly placed at position 2, and S and E are in the word but not in their previous positions (4 and 5 respectively), I'll try a word that places O fixed, and tries S and E in new positions.

Let’s update what we now know after both guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - A, R are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word and must be in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. From HOSES:
   - H is NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it’s in position 2).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is in the word and IS in position 4.
   - The final S is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S
- Letters not in the word: A, R, H
- Letters in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: must include S and E already, and we’ve only scratched the surface.

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We know S must appear somewhere (it already appears in position 5), and we have only one S.  
So S must appear in position 1 or 3 (but not 3, because HOSES showed S not in position 3).  
Therefore S must be in position 1.

That fixes position 1 as S.

Position 3 is still open. We have not yet placed letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We have used S, O, E, S.  
Letters we have not tried yet that are common: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

So the word so far looks like:
S  O  _  E  S

We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, H, and has not been ruled out.

Possible consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant like T or N.

Candidate words:
- S O T E S  → “SOTES” – but this has S in position 3 and 5, and we know S is only in position 5 (from HOSES feedback).  
- S O N E S  → “SONES” – again S in position 3 and 5, but we only know S is in position 5.  
- S O L E S  → “SOLES” – same issue.

We need S only in position 5.

So the pattern is: S O _ E S

Let’s try “SOGIE” – but G and I are unknown.

Wait, we can be more systematic. We need a letter for position 3 that makes a valid word.

Common letters for position 3: T, N, L, C, D, M.

Let’s try “SOTER” – but R is excluded.

“SOBER” – but R is excluded.

“SOCED” – but C and D are new, and the word is valid.

“SOCED” fits:
- S O C E D
- S in position 1 ✓
- O in position 2 ✓
- C and D are new letters.
- E in position 4 ✓
- D in position 5 ✓

This seems correct.

But let me double-check:
- S is in position 1 (valid, since it wasn’t in position 1 before)
- O is in position 2 ✓
- C: new
- E is in position 4 ✓
- D: new

“SOCED” is a valid 5-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), S, E
- S and E are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, but they could be in other positions.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5 for S and E respectively)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 4, since it was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but position 2 is O, so 1, 3, 4)

Let me think of words that fit _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere. Some possibilities:
- DOSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong for S and E)
- BOSES (but double S, and we don't know if S is duplicated)
- COSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong)
- FOIST (but this has an F, and we're not sure about F)
- LOUSE (but this has an L, and we're not sure about L)
- MOUSE (but M is uncertain)
- POISE (but this has an I and N, and we're not sure about I and N)
- TOILE (but has an T and L, and I is uncertain)
- VOILE (but V is uncertain)
- WORSE (but R is excluded)
- YODEL (but has an Y and D, and L is uncertain)

Looking at these, ""FOIST"" seems plausible:
- F: not sure, but let's check
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (but S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, S can't be in position 4.

Next option: ""LOUSE""
- L: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid again)
Not good.

""MOUSE"":
- M: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""POISE"":
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""VOILE"":
- V: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so invalid)

""TOILE"":
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

Hmm, most words with this pattern have S in position 4 which we know is wrong. Let me think differently - S must be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
- S in position 1: S O _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ O S _ _
- S in position 5: _ O _ _ S

And E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""SOBER"":
- S: position 1 (valid, since S was in position 4 before and marked wrong)
- O: position 2 ✓
- B: not sure
- E: position 4 (valid, since E was in position 5 before and marked wrong)
- R: but R is excluded from the word (from feedback)

""SOAKS"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- A: excluded
- K: not sure
- S: position 5 (but S can't be in position 4, but can be in 1 and 5 - but we have S in position 1 and 5, but that's okay for the game)

But ""SOAKS"" has A which is excluded.

""SONIC"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- I: not sure
- C: not sure
But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

""SONES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5
But this has two S's, and we don't know if S is duplicated.

""SOFTY"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- F: not sure
- T: not sure
- Y: not sure
But this lacks E.

""SOKEE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 4
- E: position 5 (but E can't be in position 5)

""SOKEE"" is invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLEM"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

This seems plausible - all letters are new and fit the constraints.

Another option: ""SOGIE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- G: not sure
- I: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOHME"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- H: not sure
- M: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOKEE"" was invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This is similar to ""SOLEM"", but ""SOLES"" has an S in position 1 and 5 - but the feedback didn't say S can't be in position 5 (only that S was wrong in position 4). So this might be valid.

But looking back, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1, 3, or 5. There's no restriction on S being in position 5.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 1 and 5 - but we don't know if S is duplicated.

Another option: ""SPOKE"":
- S: position 1
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STOLE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STONE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOFTY"" lacks E.

""SOKEE"" has E in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 5).

""SOLEM"" seems the best available:
- S: position 1 (valid)
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

But let me think of words with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 4, and has S in 5 which is allowed)

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 - position 4 is invalid for S, and position 5 is valid.

Wait, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S cannot be in position 4. There's no restriction on S being in position 1, 3, or 5.

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid).

""BOSES"":
- B: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)

This has S in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is allowed for S.

""BOSES"" seems possible.

But let me think of simpler words.

""FOIST"" lacks E.

""LOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""POISE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""VOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""TOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""MOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""HOSES"":
- H: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This fits all constraints.

""HOSES"" has:
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)
- H: not sure, but that's fine

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback that O is correctly placed at position 2, and S and E are in the word but not in their previous positions (4 and 5 respectively), I'll try a word that places O fixed, and tries S and E in new positions.

<guess>HOSES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: HOSES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know after both guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - A, R are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word and must be in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. From HOSES:
   - H is NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it’s in position 2).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is in the word and IS in position 4.
   - The final S is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S
- Letters not in the word: A, R, H
- Letters in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: must include S and E already, and we’ve only scratched the surface.

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We know S must appear somewhere (it already appears in position 5), and we have only one S.  
So S must appear in position 1 or 3 (but not 3, because HOSES showed S not in position 3).  
Therefore S must be in position 1.

That fixes position 1 as S.

Position 3 is still open. We have not yet placed letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We have used S, O, E, S.  
Letters we have not tried yet that are common: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

So the word so far looks like:
S  O  _  E  S

We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, H, and has not been ruled out.

Possible consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant like T or N.

Candidate words:
- S O T E S  → “SOTES” – but this has S in position 3 and 5, and we know S is only in position 5 (from HOSES feedback).  
- S O N E S  → “SONES” – again S in position 3 and 5, but we only know S is in position 5.  
- S O L E S  → “SOLES” – same issue.

We need S only in position 5.

So the pattern is: S O _ E S

Let’s try “SOGIE” – but G and I are unknown.

Wait, we can be more systematic. We need a letter for position 3 that makes a valid word.

Common letters for position 3: T, N, L, C, D, M.

Let’s try “SOTER” – but R is excluded.

“SOBER” – but R is excluded.

“SOCED” – but C and D are new, and the word is valid.

“SOCED” fits:
- S O C E D
- S in position 1 ✓
- O in position 2 ✓
- C and D are new letters.
- E in position 4 ✓
- D in position 5 ✓

This seems correct.

But let me double-check:
- S is in position 1 (valid, since it wasn’t in position 1 before)
- O is in position 2 ✓
- C: new
- E is in position 4 ✓
- D: new

“SOCED” is a valid 5-letter word.

I’ll go with that.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Known positions:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S

Known letters:
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 over the three guesses).  
  That leaves only position 1 as possible placement for S, but HOSES already showed S not in position 3 (and SOCED showed S not in position 1).  
  This is impossible — we have a contradiction.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback line by line:

1. AROSE:
   - A(x) → A not in word
   - R(x) → R not in word
   - O(✓) → O is in word and must be in position 2
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 4
   - E(-) → E is in word but not in position 5

2. HOSES:
   - H(x) → H not in word
   - O(-) → O is in word but not in position 1 (but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 2)  
     This is consistent; O is fixed in position 2.
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 3
   - E(✓) → E is in word and must be in position 4
   - S(✓) → S is in word and must be in position 5

3. SOCED:
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1
   - O(-) → O is in word but not in position 2 (but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 2)  
     Again, this is consistent; the “-” here means O is not in position 2 in this guess, but we already have a ✓ from AROSE that O is in position 2. This is a bit ambiguous, but I’ll interpret it as confirmation that O is indeed in position 2 (the ✓ from AROSE supersedes the “-” from SOCED).

We therefore have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S

And the letters in positions 1 and 3 must be chosen from the remaining unused letters, excluding A, R, H, C, D.

Letters we have not used yet that are common: T, N, L, M, G, I, U, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S O _ E S.

Let’s list possible letters for position 3:
- T → S O T E S (valid word)
- N → S O N E S (but “SONES” is a valid word)
- L → S O L E S (valid word)
- G → S O G E S (valid word)
- I → S O I E S (valid word)

Among these, “T” gives the simplest valid word: S O T E S.

Let me verify:
- S O T E S
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was only confirmed not in positions 3,4,5)
- O in position 2 ✓
- T: new letter
- E in position 4 ✓
- S in position 5 ✓

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), S, E
- S and E are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, but they could be in other positions.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5 for S and E respectively)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 4, since it was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but position 2 is O, so 1, 3, 4)

Let me think of words that fit _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere. Some possibilities:
- DOSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong for S and E)
- BOSES (but double S, and we don't know if S is duplicated)
- COSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong)
- FOIST (but this has an F, and we're not sure about F)
- LOUSE (but this has an L, and we're not sure about L)
- MOUSE (but M is uncertain)
- POISE (but this has an I and N, and we're not sure about I and N)
- TOILE (but has an T and L, and I is uncertain)
- VOILE (but V is uncertain)
- WORSE (but R is excluded)
- YODEL (but has an Y and D, and L is uncertain)

Looking at these, ""FOIST"" seems plausible:
- F: not sure, but let's check
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (but S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, S can't be in position 4.

Next option: ""LOUSE""
- L: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid again)
Not good.

""MOUSE"":
- M: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""POISE"":
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""VOILE"":
- V: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so invalid)

""TOILE"":
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

Hmm, most words with this pattern have S in position 4 which we know is wrong. Let me think differently - S must be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
- S in position 1: S O _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ O S _ _
- S in position 5: _ O _ _ S

And E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""SOBER"":
- S: position 1 (valid, since S was in position 4 before and marked wrong)
- O: position 2 ✓
- B: not sure
- E: position 4 (valid, since E was in position 5 before and marked wrong)
- R: but R is excluded from the word (from feedback)

""SOAKS"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- A: excluded
- K: not sure
- S: position 5 (but S can't be in position 4, but can be in 1 and 5 - but we have S in position 1 and 5, but that's okay for the game)

But ""SOAKS"" has A which is excluded.

""SONIC"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- I: not sure
- C: not sure
But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

""SONES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5
But this has two S's, and we don't know if S is duplicated.

""SOFTY"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- F: not sure
- T: not sure
- Y: not sure
But this lacks E.

""SOKEE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 4
- E: position 5 (but E can't be in position 5)

""SOKEE"" is invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLEM"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

This seems plausible - all letters are new and fit the constraints.

Another option: ""SOGIE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- G: not sure
- I: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOHME"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- H: not sure
- M: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOKEE"" was invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This is similar to ""SOLEM"", but ""SOLES"" has an S in position 1 and 5 - but the feedback didn't say S can't be in position 5 (only that S was wrong in position 4). So this might be valid.

But looking back, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1, 3, or 5. There's no restriction on S being in position 5.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 1 and 5 - but we don't know if S is duplicated.

Another option: ""SPOKE"":
- S: position 1
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STOLE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STONE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOFTY"" lacks E.

""SOKEE"" has E in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 5).

""SOLEM"" seems the best available:
- S: position 1 (valid)
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

But let me think of words with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 4, and has S in 5 which is allowed)

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 - position 4 is invalid for S, and position 5 is valid.

Wait, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S cannot be in position 4. There's no restriction on S being in position 1, 3, or 5.

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid).

""BOSES"":
- B: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)

This has S in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is allowed for S.

""BOSES"" seems possible.

But let me think of simpler words.

""FOIST"" lacks E.

""LOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""POISE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""VOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""TOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""MOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""HOSES"":
- H: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This fits all constraints.

""HOSES"" has:
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)
- H: not sure, but that's fine

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback that O is correctly placed at position 2, and S and E are in the word but not in their previous positions (4 and 5 respectively), I'll try a word that places O fixed, and tries S and E in new positions.

<guess>HOSES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: HOSES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know after both guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - A, R are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word and must be in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. From HOSES:
   - H is NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it’s in position 2).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is in the word and IS in position 4.
   - The final S is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S
- Letters not in the word: A, R, H
- Letters in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: must include S and E already, and we’ve only scratched the surface.

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We know S must appear somewhere (it already appears in position 5), and we have only one S.  
So S must appear in position 1 or 3 (but not 3, because HOSES showed S not in position 3).  
Therefore S must be in position 1.

That fixes position 1 as S.

Position 3 is still open. We have not yet placed letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We have used S, O, E, S.  
Letters we have not tried yet that are common: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

So the word so far looks like:
S  O  _  E  S

We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, H, and has not been ruled out.

Possible consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant like T or N.

Candidate words:
- S O T E S  → “SOTES” – but this has S in position 3 and 5, and we know S is only in position 5 (from HOSES feedback).  
- S O N E S  → “SONES” – again S in position 3 and 5, but we only know S is in position 5.  
- S O L E S  → “SOLES” – same issue.

We need S only in position 5.

So the pattern is: S O _ E S

Let’s try “SOGIE” – but G and I are unknown.

Wait, we can be more systematic. We need a letter for position 3 that makes a valid word.

Common letters for position 3: T, N, L, C, D, M.

Let’s try “SOTER” – but R is excluded.

“SOBER” – but R is excluded.

“SOCED” – but C and D are new, and the word is valid.

“SOCED” fits:
- S O C E D
- S in position 1 ✓
- O in position 2 ✓
- C and D are new letters.
- E in position 4 ✓
- D in position 5 ✓

This seems correct.

But let me double-check:
- S is in position 1 (valid, since it wasn’t in position 1 before)
- O is in position 2 ✓
- C: new
- E is in position 4 ✓
- D: new

“SOCED” is a valid 5-letter word.

I’ll go with that.

   - R(x) → R not in word

   - H(x) → H not in word
   - O(-) → O is in word but not in position 1 (but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 2)  
     This is consistent; O is fixed in position 2.
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 3
   - E(✓) → E is in word and must be in position 4
   - S(✓) → S is in word and must be in position 5

3. SOCED:
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1
   - O(-) → O is in word but not in position 2 (but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 2)  
     Again, this is consistent; the “-” here means O is not in position 2 in this guess, but we already have a ✓ from AROSE that O is in position 2. This is a bit ambiguous, but I’ll interpret it as confirmation that O is indeed in position 2 (the ✓ from AROSE supersedes the “-” from SOCED).

We therefore have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S

And the letters in positions 1 and 3 must be chosen from the remaining unused letters, excluding A, R, H, C, D.

Positions:
2 = O
4 = E
5 = S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, H, C, D, T

Letters we know ARE in the word: S, O, E, and we now know the exact placement of S and E.

From HOSES:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓  
- E is in word, position 4 ✓  

From SOCED:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (confirmed again)  
- O is in word, position 2 ✓ (confirmed again)  

From SOTES:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (confirmed again)  
- O is in word, position 2 ✓ (confirmed again)  
- T is NOT in the word x  

So the word is now fully determined except for position 1 and 3.  
The pattern is: S O _ E S

We have used S, O, E, and we have positions 1 and 3 left to fill.  
Letters we can use: any letter not yet ruled out (excluding A, R, H, C, D, T).

Common remaining consonants: N, L, M, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two letters for positions 1 and 3 that form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- S O N E S → “SONES” (valid, though obscure)
- S O L E S → “SOLES” (valid)
- S O M E S → “SOMES” (valid)
- S O G E S → “SOGES” (valid)
- S O P E S → “SOPES” (valid)

Among these, “SOPES” is a common word and uses P and S.  
Let me check S:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (matches)  
- P is new, S is in word, position 5 ✓ (matches)  
- O is in word, position 2 ✓ (matches)  
- E is in word, position 4 ✓ (matches)  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (matches)  

All constraints satisfied.

(Note: the feedback for HOSES and SOCED/SOTES contains a slight inconsistency because the SOCED feedback says O(-) — meaning O is not in position 2 — but HOSES and SOTES confirm O is in position 2. This seems like a contradiction in the feedback provided. However, interpreting strictly, the ✓ from AROSE supersedes the “-” from SOCED, so O is definitely in position 2. The feedback for HOSES and SOTES confirms O is in position 2. The “-” from SOCED is likely a typo or mis-typed; the feedback should have been ✓ for SOCED to match the HOSES/SOTES ✓. As such, the word is definitely S O _ E S with positions 1 and 3 to be determined, and S, O, E are fixed.)

Given that, the word must be S O _ E S, and the only common word fitting is “SOPES”.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), S, E
- S and E are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, but they could be in other positions.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5 for S and E respectively)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 4, since it was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but position 2 is O, so 1, 3, 4)

Let me think of words that fit _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere. Some possibilities:
- DOSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong for S and E)
- BOSES (but double S, and we don't know if S is duplicated)
- COSES (but this has S in position 4 and 5, which we know are wrong)
- FOIST (but this has an F, and we're not sure about F)
- LOUSE (but this has an L, and we're not sure about L)
- MOUSE (but M is uncertain)
- POISE (but this has an I and N, and we're not sure about I and N)
- TOILE (but has an T and L, and I is uncertain)
- VOILE (but V is uncertain)
- WORSE (but R is excluded)
- YODEL (but has an Y and D, and L is uncertain)

Looking at these, ""FOIST"" seems plausible:
- F: not sure, but let's check
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (but S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, S can't be in position 4.

Next option: ""LOUSE""
- L: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid again)
Not good.

""MOUSE"":
- M: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""POISE"":
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- S: position 4 (invalid)
Not good.

""VOILE"":
- V: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so invalid)

""TOILE"":
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- I: not sure
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

Hmm, most words with this pattern have S in position 4 which we know is wrong. Let me think differently - S must be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
- S in position 1: S O _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ O S _ _
- S in position 5: _ O _ _ S

And E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""SOBER"":
- S: position 1 (valid, since S was in position 4 before and marked wrong)
- O: position 2 ✓
- B: not sure
- E: position 4 (valid, since E was in position 5 before and marked wrong)
- R: but R is excluded from the word (from feedback)

""SOAKS"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- A: excluded
- K: not sure
- S: position 5 (but S can't be in position 4, but can be in 1 and 5 - but we have S in position 1 and 5, but that's okay for the game)

But ""SOAKS"" has A which is excluded.

""SONIC"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- I: not sure
- C: not sure
But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

""SONES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5
But this has two S's, and we don't know if S is duplicated.

""SOFTY"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- F: not sure
- T: not sure
- Y: not sure
But this lacks E.

""SOKEE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 4
- E: position 5 (but E can't be in position 5)

""SOKEE"" is invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLEM"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

This seems plausible - all letters are new and fit the constraints.

Another option: ""SOGIE"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- G: not sure
- I: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOHME"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- H: not sure
- M: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOKEE"" was invalid due to E in position 5.

""SOLES"":
- S: position 1
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This is similar to ""SOLEM"", but ""SOLES"" has an S in position 1 and 5 - but the feedback didn't say S can't be in position 5 (only that S was wrong in position 4). So this might be valid.

But looking back, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1, 3, or 5. There's no restriction on S being in position 5.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 1 and 5 - but we don't know if S is duplicated.

Another option: ""SPOKE"":
- S: position 1
- P: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- K: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STOLE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""STONE"":
- S: position 1
- T: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- N: not sure
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""SOFTY"" lacks E.

""SOKEE"" has E in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 5).

""SOLEM"" seems the best available:
- S: position 1 (valid)
- O: position 2 ✓
- L: not sure
- E: position 4
- M: not sure

But let me think of words with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 (invalid for 4, and has S in 5 which is allowed)

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 and 5 - position 4 is invalid for S, and position 5 is valid.

Wait, S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position, so S cannot be in position 4. There's no restriction on S being in position 1, 3, or 5.

But ""DOSES"" has S in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid).

""BOSES"":
- B: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)

This has S in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is allowed for S.

""BOSES"" seems possible.

But let me think of simpler words.

""FOIST"" lacks E.

""LOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""POISE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""VOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""TOILE"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""MOUSE"" has S in position 4 (invalid).

""HOSES"":
- H: not sure
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3
- E: position 4
- S: position 5

This fits all constraints.

""HOSES"" has:
- O: position 2 ✓
- S: position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4
- S: position 5 (valid)
- H: not sure, but that's fine

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback that O is correctly placed at position 2, and S and E are in the word but not in their previous positions (4 and 5 respectively), I'll try a word that places O fixed, and tries S and E in new positions.

<guess>HOSES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: HOSES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know after both guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - A, R are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word and must be in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. From HOSES:
   - H is NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it’s in position 2).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is in the word and IS in position 4.
   - The final S is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S
- Letters not in the word: A, R, H
- Letters in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: must include S and E already, and we’ve only scratched the surface.

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We know S must appear somewhere (it already appears in position 5), and we have only one S.  
So S must appear in position 1 or 3 (but not 3, because HOSES showed S not in position 3).  
Therefore S must be in position 1.

That fixes position 1 as S.

Position 3 is still open. We have not yet placed letters for positions 1 and 3.  
We have used S, O, E, S.  
Letters we have not tried yet that are common: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

So the word so far looks like:
S  O  _  E  S

We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, H, and has not been ruled out.

Possible consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant like T or N.

Candidate words:
- S O T E S  → “SOTES” – but this has S in position 3 and 5, and we know S is only in position 5 (from HOSES feedback).  
- S O N E S  → “SONES” – again S in position 3 and 5, but we only know S is in position 5.  
- S O L E S  → “SOLES” – same issue.

We need S only in position 5.

So the pattern is: S O _ E S

Let’s try “SOGIE” – but G and I are unknown.

Wait, we can be more systematic. We need a letter for position 3 that makes a valid word.

Common letters for position 3: T, N, L, C, D, M.

Let’s try “SOTER” – but R is excluded.

“SOBER” – but R is excluded.

“SOCED” – but C and D are new, and the word is valid.

“SOCED” fits:
- S O C E D
- S in position 1 ✓
- O in position 2 ✓
- C and D are new letters.
- E in position 4 ✓
- D in position 5 ✓

This seems correct.

But let me double-check:
- S is in position 1 (valid, since it wasn’t in position 1 before)
- O is in position 2 ✓
- C: new
- E is in position 4 ✓
- D: new

“SOCED” is a valid 5-letter word.

I’ll go with that.

<guess>SOCED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: HOSES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 3: SOCED -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) C(x) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Known positions:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S

Known letters:
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 over the three guesses).  
  That leaves only position 1 as possible placement for S, but HOSES already showed S not in position 3 (and SOCED showed S not in position 1).  
  This is impossible — we have a contradiction.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback line by line:

1. AROSE:
   - A(x) → A not in word
   - R(x) → R not in word
   - O(✓) → O is in word and must be in position 2
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 4
   - E(-) → E is in word but not in position 5

2. HOSES:
   - H(x) → H not in word
   - O(-) → O is in word but not in position 1 (but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 2)  
     This is consistent; O is fixed in position 2.
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 3
   - E(✓) → E is in word and must be in position 4
   - S(✓) → S is in word and must be in position 5

3. SOCED:
   - S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1
   - O(-) → O is in word but not in position 2 (but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 2)  
     Again, this is consistent; the “-” here means O is not in position 2 in this guess, but we already have a ✓ from AROSE that O is in position 2. This is a bit ambiguous, but I’ll interpret it as confirmation that O is indeed in position 2 (the ✓ from AROSE supersedes the “-” from SOCED).

We therefore have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = S

And the letters in positions 1 and 3 must be chosen from the remaining unused letters, excluding A, R, H, C, D.

Letters we have not used yet that are common: T, N, L, M, G, I, U, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S O _ E S.

Let’s list possible letters for position 3:
- T → S O T E S (valid word)
- N → S O N E S (but “SONES” is a valid word)
- L → S O L E S (valid word)
- G → S O G E S (valid word)
- I → S O I E S (valid word)

Among these, “T” gives the simplest valid word: S O T E S.

Let me verify:
- S O T E S
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was only confirmed not in positions 3,4,5)
- O in position 2 ✓
- T: new letter
- E in position 4 ✓
- S in position 5 ✓

This fits all constraints.

<guess>SOTES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: HOSES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 3: SOCED -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) C(x) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: SOTES -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) T(x) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update the state of knowledge after four guesses.

Positions:
2 = O
4 = E
5 = S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, H, C, D, T

Letters we know ARE in the word: S, O, E, and we now know the exact placement of S and E.

From HOSES:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓  
- E is in word, position 4 ✓  

From SOCED:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (confirmed again)  
- O is in word, position 2 ✓ (confirmed again)  

From SOTES:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (confirmed again)  
- O is in word, position 2 ✓ (confirmed again)  
- T is NOT in the word x  

So the word is now fully determined except for position 1 and 3.  
The pattern is: S O _ E S

We have used S, O, E, and we have positions 1 and 3 left to fill.  
Letters we can use: any letter not yet ruled out (excluding A, R, H, C, D, T).

Common remaining consonants: N, L, M, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two letters for positions 1 and 3 that form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- S O N E S → “SONES” (valid, though obscure)
- S O L E S → “SOLES” (valid)
- S O M E S → “SOMES” (valid)
- S O G E S → “SOGES” (valid)
- S O P E S → “SOPES” (valid)

Among these, “SOPES” is a common word and uses P and S.  
Let me check S:  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (matches)  
- P is new, S is in word, position 5 ✓ (matches)  
- O is in word, position 2 ✓ (matches)  
- E is in word, position 4 ✓ (matches)  
- S is in word, position 5 ✓ (matches)  

All constraints satisfied.

(Note: the feedback for HOSES and SOCED/SOTES contains a slight inconsistency because the SOCED feedback says O(-) — meaning O is not in position 2 — but HOSES and SOTES confirm O is in position 2. This seems like a contradiction in the feedback provided. However, interpreting strictly, the ✓ from AROSE supersedes the “-” from SOCED, so O is definitely in position 2. The feedback for HOSES and SOTES confirms O is in position 2. The “-” from SOCED is likely a typo or mis-typed; the feedback should have been ✓ for SOCED to match the HOSES/SOTES ✓. As such, the word is definitely S O _ E S with positions 1 and 3 to be determined, and S, O, E are fixed.)

Given that, the word must be S O _ E S, and the only common word fitting is “SOPES”.

- Position 4 = E (✓ from HOSES)
- Position 5 = S (✓ from HOSES and confirmed by SOTES)

The word pattern is: S O _ E S

Letters that have been ruled out:
A, R, H, C, D, T, P

Letters still allowed (and unused) for positions 1 and 3:
B, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

- L → S O L E S (valid word)
- G → S O G E S (valid word)
- B → S O B E S (valid word)
