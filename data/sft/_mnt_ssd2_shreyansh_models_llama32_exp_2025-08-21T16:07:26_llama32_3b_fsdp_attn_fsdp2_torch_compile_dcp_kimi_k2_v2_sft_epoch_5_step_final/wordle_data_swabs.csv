### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

- O is not in the word at all.

A good candidate is “SCALD”:

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the allowed set. We should prioritize common letters first.

Looking at remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U (as consonant), Y.

Possible candidates:

Let’s think of real words:
- S B A B _ : Not valid.

- S M A K E : E is out.
- S M A K _ : MAK? No.
- S H A M A : A is already in position 3, but word could have duplicate A. However, we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters.
- S H A M E : E is out.
- S H A M A : Valid word, uses H, M, A. A is allowed to appear twice.

Another angle: position 5 must be a consonant from the allowed set. Let’s try S H A M A (SHAMA). But ""SHAMA"" is not a standard English word (it’s a variant spelling of ""sham"" but not common).

Let’s think differently: position 2 and 5. Position 5 must be a consonant from allowed set. Let’s try S M A K Y (SMAKY – not a word). S M A K E (E out). S M A K A (valid word ""SMAKA""? No). 

Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words starting with S, A in position 3, and using allowed letters:

- S M A K A – not a word.
- S H A M A – valid word (""shama"" or ""shamm"" but not standard).
- S P A M S – not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1)
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. A good candidate is ""SAINT"" – it uses S and A, places S in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (also a new position), and introduces other common consonants (N, T) that haven't been tested yet. This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so the word starts with S.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A (positions 3,4, or 5 only).
- Does not contain R, O, E, I, N, T.
- Does contain S in position 1.

Remaining possible letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A, and using only the remaining letters. The most common remaining consonants are B, C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to place A in position 3, 4, or 5, and pick other consonants from the allowed set.

A good candidate is “SCALD”:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 3.
- Uses C, L, D (all allowed).
- All letters are unique, maximizing information gain.

Another candidate could be “SALAD” (but it has two A’s; we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters, so it’s safer to avoid). “SCALD” seems best.

Let’s go with “SCALD”.

We need:

Looking for common words fitting S _ A _ _ with remaining letters:

Possible consonants for positions 2,4,5: B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Let’s brainstorm:
- S B A _ _ : SB?A? No common words.
- S M A _ _ : SM?A? Possible: “SMACK” – but C, K are out.
- S P A _ _ : SP?A? Possible: “SPASM” – but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if S repeats.
- S G A _ _ : SG?A? No common words.
- S F A _ _ : SF?A? No common words.

- S M A F _ : SMAF_ – no.
- S M A J K – K is out.
- S M A P E – E is out.
- S M A B Y – Y is out.

Real words starting with S, A at 3:
- SMACK – C, K out.
- SPASM – S repeats (possible), P, S, M, A, but we don’t know if S repeats.
- SWAMI – W, M, I – I is out.

- SHALM – H, L out.
- SHARK – H, R out.
- SHAME – H, E out.
- SHAWN – H, N out.

Looking again, the only plausible word seems to be “SPASM” (S P A S M), but we don’t know if S repeats and M is allowed.

Another candidate: “SUAVE” – but E is out.
“SUGAR” – R is out.
“SAPPY” – Y is out.

Wait, let’s check “SPASM” again:
- S P A S M
- Letters: S, P, A, S, M
- S is allowed to repeat? We don’t know, but it’s possible.
- All letters are allowed (P, M not ruled out yet).

Another candidate: “SWAMP” – W, M, P allowed.
- S W A M P
- Letters: S, W, A, M, P
- W is allowed, M, P allowed.

But “SWAMP” uses W, which hasn’t been tested yet, and fits S _ A _ _ with allowed letters.

Between SPASM and SWAMP, SWAMP uses new letter W and doesn’t assume S repeats.

So, let’s choose SWAMP.

Check:
- S(✓) W _ A _ M _ P
- W is allowed, M and P allowed.
- No ruled-out letters used.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1)
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. A good candidate is ""SAINT"" – it uses S and A, places S in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (also a new position), and introduces other common consonants (N, T) that haven't been tested yet. This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

<guess>SAINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so the word starts with S.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A (positions 3,4, or 5 only).
- Does not contain R, O, E, I, N, T.
- Does contain S in position 1.

Remaining possible letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A, and using only the remaining letters. The most common remaining consonants are B, C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to place A in position 3, 4, or 5, and pick other consonants from the allowed set.

A good candidate is “SCALD”:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 3.
- Uses C, L, D (all allowed).
- All letters are unique, maximizing information gain.

Another candidate could be “SALAD” (but it has two A’s; we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters, so it’s safer to avoid). “SCALD” seems best.

Let’s go with “SCALD”.

Guess 3: SCALD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, T are not in the word.

3. SCALD → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(x) D(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in position 3 (✓).
   - C, L, D are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, L, D
- Remaining possible letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the allowed set. We should prioritize common letters first.

Looking at remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U (as consonant), Y.

Possible candidates:
- S B A _ _ : SB??
- S M A _ _ : SM???
- S P A _ _ : SP???
- S H A _ _ : SH???
- S G A _ _ : SG???

Let’s think of real words:
- S B A B _ : Not valid.
- S M A K _ : MAK? No, 5-letter word needs to end with a consonant.
- S P A R K : R is out.
- S H A R K : R is out.
- S P A C K : C is out.
- S M A R T : T is out.
- S M A K E : E is out.
- S M A K _ : MAK? No.
- S H A M A : A is already in position 3, but word could have duplicate A. However, we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters.
- S H A M E : E is out.
- S H A M A : Valid word, uses H, M, A. A is allowed to appear twice.

Another angle: position 5 must be a consonant from the allowed set. Let’s try S H A M A (SHAMA). But ""SHAMA"" is not a standard English word (it’s a variant spelling of ""sham"" but not common).

Let’s think differently: position 2 and 5. Position 5 must be a consonant from allowed set. Let’s try S M A K Y (SMAKY – not a word). S M A K E (E out). S M A K A (valid word ""SMAKA""? No). 

Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words starting with S, A in position 3, and using allowed letters:

- S M A K A – not a word.
- S H A M A – valid word (""shama"" or ""shamm"" but not standard).
- S P A M S – not a word.
- S M A K Y – not a word.
- S W A M I – I is out.
- S W A M P – not a word.

Real words starting with S, A in position 3:
- SHAKY – but Y is allowed (not in ruled-out list).
- SHARK – R is out.
- SHAME – E is out.
- SHALM – L is out.
- SHAWN – N is out.
- SHAYS – S is already in position 1, but Y is allowed.

Wait, let’s check SHALM – L is out. SHAWN – N is out. SHAYS – S is allowed to repeat? No, we don’t know.

SHAKY uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- H (allowed)
- A (position 3 ✓)
- K (allowed)
- Y (allowed)

This seems valid. Let’s check if any letters in SHAKY are ruled out:
- S, H, A, K, Y – none are in the excluded list.

This is a strong candidate.

Another candidate: S P A R K – R is out. S M A R K – R is out. S H A R K – R is out.

SHAKY seems the best available option.

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, L, D, H, K, Y, M, P.

Remaining letters allowed: B, F, G, J, Q, U, V, X, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, both from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 4: B, F, G, J, Q, U, V, X, Z
- Position 5: same list, but must form a valid 5-letter word with S, W, A already used.

Looking for real words:
- SWATH – H is out.
- SWATS – T is out.
- SWAGI – I is out.
- SWAMI – I is out.
- SWACK – C, K out.
- SWAMP – already tried (M, P out).
- SWASH – S repeats (possible), but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if S repeats.
- SWAZI – I is out.
- SWAVE – E is out.
- SWAYS – Y is out.

The only plausible word left seems to be “SWASH” (S W A S H), but H is ruled out.

Next possible: “SWAGS” – but G is allowed, S is allowed to repeat, and “SWAGS” is a valid word.

Check letters:
- S, W, A, G, S
- G is allowed (not ruled out yet).
- S repeats (possible).

“SWAGS” fits S W A _ _ with G in position 4 and S in position 5.

Another candidate: “SWANK” – N is out.
“SWAMP” already tried.
“SWASH” – H is out.

“SWAGS” seems the only valid word left with current constraints.
