### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opener.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opener.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters in the word but wrong position: A (not 1st), S (not 4th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, O, or E
- Contains A somewhere other than 1st
- Contains S somewhere other than 4th

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed)

I'll try a word that places A in the 2nd position and S in the 1st or 2nd, and uses other common letters. ""SAINT"" comes to mind:
- S (1st position, satisfies S is in word)
- A (2nd position, satisfies A is in word and not 1st)
- I (3rd position, new letter)
- N (4th position, new letter)
- T (5th position, new letter)

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A (positions 3,4, or 5 only).
- Does not contain R, O, E, I, N, T.
- Still need to place A and find the remaining two letters.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, L, M, P, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already confirmed, and I, O, E are out).

A good next word would:
- Keep S in position 1.
- Try A in position 3 (middle).
- Use two new common consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Candidate: S _ A _ _
Possible letters: C, D, L, M, etc.

Let’s try “SCALD”:
- S (1st) ✓ already.
- C (2nd) new letter.
- A (3rd) possible position for A.
- L (4th) new letter.
- D (5th) new letter.

This uses three new letters (C, L, D) while placing A in a new spot and keeping S fixed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opener.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters in the word but wrong position: A (not 1st), S (not 4th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, O, or E
- Contains A somewhere other than 1st
- Contains S somewhere other than 4th

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed)

I'll try a word that places A in the 2nd position and S in the 1st or 2nd, and uses other common letters. ""SAINT"" comes to mind:
- S (1st position, satisfies S is in word)
- A (2nd position, satisfies A is in word and not 1st)
- I (3rd position, new letter)
- N (4th position, new letter)
- T (5th position, new letter)

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

<guess>SAINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I, N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A (positions 3,4, or 5 only).
- Does not contain R, O, E, I, N, T.
- Still need to place A and find the remaining two letters.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, L, M, P, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already confirmed, and I, O, E are out).

A good next word would:
- Keep S in position 1.
- Try A in position 3 (middle).
- Use two new common consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Candidate: S _ A _ _
Possible letters: C, D, L, M, etc.

Let’s try “SCALD”:
- S (1st) ✓ already.
- C (2nd) new letter.
- A (3rd) possible position for A.
- L (4th) new letter.
- D (5th) new letter.

This uses three new letters (C, L, D) while placing A in a new spot and keeping S fixed.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: SCALD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.
   – R, O, E are out.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   – S is in position 1 (✓).
   – A is in the word but not in position 2.
   – I, N, T are out.

3. SCALD → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) D(x)
   – S is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 3.
   – L is confirmed in position 4.
   – C and D are out.

Current known pattern: S _ A L _
Letters already used / ruled out: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, D.

Remaining possible consonants for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (only one left).

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in position 3, and L in position 4. The pattern is S _ A L _.

Possible candidates:
- S B A L _ → SBAL_ (no valid word)
- S P A L _ → SPAL_ (no valid word)
- S H A L _ → SHAL_ (no valid word)
- S M A L _ → SMAL_ (no valid word)
- S G A L _ → SGAL_ (no valid word)
- S F A L _ → SFAL_ (no valid word)
- S G A L L → SGALL (not a word)
- S P A L L → SPALL (valid word)

SPALL is a real word meaning “to chip or flake off,” and it fits the pattern S _ A L _ with the letters P and L.

Let’s try SPALL.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SCALD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: SPALL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback:

Known positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 3 (✓).
- L is in position 4 (✓).

Known letters:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, D, P.
- L is in position 4, so the second L in SPALL (position 5) is wrong (L-). Therefore, there is only one L in the word, and it is in position 4.

Remaining positions to fill: 2 and 5.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (only vowel left)

We need a valid 5-letter word in the pattern: S _ A L _

Possible candidates:
- S B A L _ → SBAL_ (invalid)
- S F A L _ → SFAL_ (invalid)
- S G A L _ → SGAL_ (invalid)
- S H A L _ → SHAL_ (invalid)
- S M A L _ → SMAL_ (invalid)
- S V A L _ → SVAL_ (invalid)
- S W A L _ → SWAL_ (invalid)
- S U A L _ → SUAL_ (invalid)
- S B A L L → SBALL (invalid)
- S H A L L → SHALL (valid word)

SHALL is a valid word meaning “shall not” or “should not,” and it fits the pattern S _ A L _ with H in position 2 and L in position 4.

Let’s try SHALL.
