1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word so far is S L _ _ _.  
I need three more letters that:
1. Are not A, T, or E.
2. Fit in positions 3, 4, 5.

Common consonants not yet ruled out: R, N, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, V, W, Y, Z, J, Q.  
Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A good next probe should test several new consonants and a vowel.  
SLING is a strong candidate: it keeps the S and L we know are correct, adds I and G, and N.  
It also avoids the ruled-out letters A, T, E.

Let’s go with SLING.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: S L U _ _  (positions 1,2,3 locked)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, I, N, M, P
- Letter G is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 3 (from Guess 3), so G must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 5 is already ruled out for G, so G must be in position 4.

Thus the pattern is: S L U G _

We need two more letters for positions 5 and 6 that are NOT in the banned set {A, T, E, I, N, M, P}. Available letters include: B, C, D, F, H, K, O, R, S, V, W, Y, Z, J, Q.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching SLUG_:
- SLUGS (S repeats, but S is allowed)
- SLUFF (not a valid word)
- SLUGY (not a valid word)
- SLUGO (not a valid word)
- SLUGC (not a valid word)

The only valid common word is SLUGS. Let's try it.
