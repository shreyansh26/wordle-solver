- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative word ""SLATE"" is also popular, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

A good candidate word would be ""RAINS"":
- R is in position 1 (was position 2 before)
- A is in position 2 (was position 1 before)
- I is a new vowel (since O and E are out)
- N is a common consonant
- S is in position 5 (was position 4 before)

This should help us determine the correct positions for R, A, and S while testing new letters.

This places R, I in new spots and tests T and P.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word (but positions still unknown):
- A, R, I, S

Known letters with positions:
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)
- S is correct in position 5 (✓)

Letters definitely out:
- O, E, N, P

Current pattern: T _ _ _ S

We need to place A, R, I in positions 2, 3, 4 without using any of them in positions we’ve already ruled out.

Positions ruled out for each known letter:
- A: not 1, 2
- R: not 2, 1
- I: not 3

So possible positions:
- A can be 3 or 4
- R can be 3 or 4
- I can be 2 or 4

We still need two more consonants. Good untested common consonants: C, D, L, M, U, Y.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Starts with T
2. Ends with S
3. Uses A, R, I in allowed positions
4. Adds one or two new consonants

Candidate structure: T _ _ _ S
We must fit A, R, I into positions 2,3,4.

Possible combinations:
- If A is 3: T _ A _ S → need R and I in 2,4
  - T R A I S → “TRAIS” – not a valid word
  - T I A R S → “TIARS” – invalid
- If A is 4: T _ _ A S → need R and I in 2,3
  - T R I A S → “TRIAS” – invalid
  - T I R A S → “TIRAS” – invalid
- If I is 2: T I _ _ S → need A and R in 3,4
  - T I M A S → “TIMAS” – invalid
- If I is 4: T _ _ I S → need A and R in 2,3
  - T A R I S → “TARIS” – invalid
  - T R A I S → “TRAIS” – invalid

Let’s try “C” and “L” as new consonants.

Structure: T _ _ _ S
We need A, R, I in positions 2,3,4.

Option 1: A 3, R 4, I 2 → T I A R S → “TIARS” – invalid
Option 2: A 4, R 2, I 3 – but I cannot be in 3 (from feedback), so invalid.

Option 3: A 3, I 4, R 2 → T R A I S → “TRAIS” – invalid
Option 4: A 4, I 2, R 3 → T I R A S → “TIaras” – invalid

Option 5: Use “L” and “C” as new consonants.
We need to fit A, R, I in positions 2,3,4.

Try “C” in 2 and “L” in 3: T C L _ S – but we need 4 letters.

Better approach: look for valid 5-letter words fitting T _ _ _ S with remaining letters.

Valid word: “TARIS” – but “TARIS” is not a recognized English word.

Valid word: “TAROS” – contains O, out.

Valid word: “TARPS” – contains P, out.

Valid word: “TARDS” – contains D, but D is untested.

But we must use A, R, I.

Valid word: “TRASH” – contains H (new), but T is fixed in 1, S in 5: T _ _ _ S – so second letter must be A, R, I.

Valid word: “TRASH” – T R A S H – but S is in position 4 here, not 5. Wrong.

Valid word: “TRIAS” – invalid

Valid word: “TIRAS” – invalid

Valid word: “TARIS” – invalid

Valid word: “TAROS” – invalid

Valid word: “TARPS” – invalid

Valid word: “TARDS” – T A R D S – positions: T(1) A(2) R(3) D(4) S(5) – but S must be 5, so this is T A R D S – S is 5th. This fits!

T A R D S:
- T (✓) position 1
- A (must be somewhere, now in position 2 – but feedback said A is in word but wrong positions before, and position 2 was only ruled out for A in previous guesses when A was in 1 or 2 – wait, in AROSE A was in 1 (wrong), in RAINS A was in 2 (wrong), and in TRIPS A was not used. So A can be 3 or 4.

Similarly R: in AROSE R was 2 (wrong), in RAINS R was 1 (wrong), in TRIPS R was 2 (wrong) – so R can be 3 or 4.
I: in RAINS I was 3 (wrong), in TRIPS I was 3 (wrong) – so I can be 2 or 4.

In TARD S word: T A R D S
- A is in position 2 – but A cannot be in 2 (from RAINS feedback). So invalid.

Next try: T I R A S – “TIaras” – invalid

Another approach: fit A, R, I into positions 2,3,4.

“TRAKS”:
- T (✓) position 1
- R (must be in 2,3,4 – here R is 2) – but R was in 2 before and feedback said R is in word but wrong position (from TRIPS: R was 2, feedback –). So R cannot be 2. Thus invalid.

Valid word: “TRAGI” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAIK” – ends with K.

Valid word: “TRAJI” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAKS” – ends with S, but R is in 2 – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAMS” – ends with S, M is new, but R is 2 – invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list positions:

Letters to place: A, R, I in 2,3,4
- A cannot be 1,2 – so 3 or 4
- R cannot be 1,2 – so 3 or 4
- I cannot be 3 – so 2 or 4

Possible placements:
- I in 2, A in 3 or 4
- I in 4, A in 3 or 4 (but A can’t be 4 if I is 4, because then A would have to be 3)

Let’s try:
I in 2, A in 3: T I A _ S
Need R in 4: T I A R S → “TIARS” – invalid
Need R in 3: T I R A S → “TIaras” – invalid

I in 2, A in 4: T I _ A S
Need R in 3: T I R A S → “TIARA” – but A is 4, which is allowed (only ruled out 1,2 for A), R is 3 (allowed), S is 5 (fixed).

“TIARA” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- T (✓) position 1
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I was wrong only in 3)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was wrong only in 1,2)
- A in position 4 (allowed, since A was wrong only in 1,2)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative word ""SLATE"" is also popular, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, S but NOT O or E.
- None of A, R, S are in their guessed positions (positions 1,2,4 respectively).

Next, I need a word that:
1. Uses A, R, S in different positions than before.
2. Does not use O or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible letters left to try: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate word would be ""RAINS"":
- R is in position 1 (was position 2 before)
- A is in position 2 (was position 1 before)
- I is a new vowel (since O and E are out)
- N is a common consonant
- S is in position 5 (was position 4 before)

This should help us determine the correct positions for R, A, and S while testing new letters.

<guess>RAINS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RAINS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but not yet in the correct spots):
- A (wrong in positions 1 and 2)
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 1)
- I (wrong in position 3)
- S (wrong in position 4, but finally correct in position 5)

Letters that are definitely out:
- O, E, N

So the mystery word is _ _ _ _ S, contains A, R, and I somewhere, and does not contain O, E, or N.

Positions we still need to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4  
Known letters to place: A, R, I, S (with S locked in position 5).

A good next guess should:
1. Lock S in position 5 (already done).
2. Try A, R, I in new positions.
3. Add one or two new common consonants to test.

Candidate words:
- TRIAS (but TRIAS isn’t a valid 5-letter word)
- RASI C (but C is untested and RASI is not common)
- ARISE (but E is out)
- RAISE (but E is out)
- IRATE (but E is out)
- TRIAS (invalid)
- CRISP (but P is untested and C,R,I,S,P: C,R,I,S,P – only S is known, C and P are new)

The valid word “CRISP” uses:
- C (new letter)
- R (known, now in position 2)
- I (known, now in position 3)
- S (known, now in position 4 – but we learned S is correct in position 5, so position 4 is wrong for S; actually position 5 is fixed as S, so position 4 is irrelevant)
Wait, that’s wrong: S must be in position 5, so position 4 is not S.

Correct word: “CRISP” is 5 letters but ends with P, not S – so that’s invalid.

Better choice: “TRIPS”
- T (new letter)
- R (known, now in position 2)
- I (known, now in position 3)
- P (new letter)
- S (known, now in position 5 – correct)

This places R, I in new spots and tests T and P.

Let’s use “TRIPS”.

<guess>TRIPS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RAINS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
Guess 3: TRIPS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word (but positions still unknown):
- A, R, I, S

Known letters with positions:
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)
- S is correct in position 5 (✓)

Letters definitely out:
- O, E, N, P

Current pattern: T _ _ _ S

We need to place A, R, I in positions 2, 3, 4 without using any of them in positions we’ve already ruled out.

Positions ruled out for each known letter:
- A: not 1, 2
- R: not 2, 1
- I: not 3

So possible positions:
- A can be 3 or 4
- R can be 3 or 4
- I can be 2 or 4

We still need two more consonants. Good untested common consonants: C, D, L, M, U, Y.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Starts with T
2. Ends with S
3. Uses A, R, I in allowed positions
4. Adds one or two new consonants

Candidate structure: T _ _ _ S
We must fit A, R, I into positions 2,3,4.

Possible combinations:
- If A is 3: T _ A _ S → need R and I in 2,4
  - T R A I S → “TRAIS” – not a valid word
  - T I A R S → “TIARS” – invalid
- If A is 4: T _ _ A S → need R and I in 2,3
  - T R I A S → “TRIAS” – invalid
  - T I R A S → “TIRAS” – invalid
- If I is 2: T I _ _ S → need A and R in 3,4
  - T I M A S → “TIMAS” – invalid
- If I is 4: T _ _ I S → need A and R in 2,3
  - T A R I S → “TARIS” – invalid
  - T R A I S → “TRAIS” – invalid

Let’s try “C” and “L” as new consonants.

Structure: T _ _ _ S
We need A, R, I in positions 2,3,4.

Option 1: A 3, R 4, I 2 → T I A R S → “TIARS” – invalid
Option 2: A 4, R 2, I 3 – but I cannot be in 3 (from feedback), so invalid.

Option 3: A 3, I 4, R 2 → T R A I S → “TRAIS” – invalid
Option 4: A 4, I 2, R 3 → T I R A S → “TIaras” – invalid

Option 5: Use “L” and “C” as new consonants.
We need to fit A, R, I in positions 2,3,4.

Try “C” in 2 and “L” in 3: T C L _ S – but we need 4 letters.

Better approach: look for valid 5-letter words fitting T _ _ _ S with remaining letters.

Valid word: “TARIS” – but “TARIS” is not a recognized English word.

Valid word: “TILAK” – ends with K, not S.

Valid word: “TAROS” – contains O, out.

Valid word: “TARPS” – contains P, out.

Valid word: “TARDS” – contains D, but D is untested.

But we must use A, R, I.

Valid word: “TRASH” – contains H (new), but T is fixed in 1, S in 5: T _ _ _ S – so second letter must be A, R, I.

Valid word: “TRASH” – T R A S H – but S is in position 4 here, not 5. Wrong.

Valid word: “TRIAS” – invalid

Valid word: “TIRAS” – invalid

Valid word: “TARIS” – invalid

Valid word: “TAROS” – invalid

Valid word: “TARPS” – invalid

Valid word: “TARDS” – T A R D S – positions: T(1) A(2) R(3) D(4) S(5) – but S must be 5, so this is T A R D S – S is 5th. This fits!

T A R D S:
- T (✓) position 1
- A (must be somewhere, now in position 2 – but feedback said A is in word but wrong positions before, and position 2 was only ruled out for A in previous guesses when A was in 1 or 2 – wait, in AROSE A was in 1 (wrong), in RAINS A was in 2 (wrong), and in TRIPS A was not used. So A can be 3 or 4.

Similarly R: in AROSE R was 2 (wrong), in RAINS R was 1 (wrong), in TRIPS R was 2 (wrong) – so R can be 3 or 4.
I: in RAINS I was 3 (wrong), in TRIPS I was 3 (wrong) – so I can be 2 or 4.

In TARD S word: T A R D S
- A is in position 2 – but A cannot be in 2 (from RAINS feedback). So invalid.

Next try: T I R A S – “TIaras” – invalid

Another approach: fit A, R, I into positions 2,3,4.

Valid word: “TIARA” – but ends with A, not S.

Valid word: “TRASH” – T R A S H – S is 4, not 5.

Valid word: “TRAIL” – ends with L.

Valid word: “TRASH” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRASS” – not valid.

Valid word: “TRIAS” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRIAS” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAIK” – ends with K.

Valid word: “TRAGI” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAJI” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAKS” – ends with S, but K is new.

“TRAKS”:
- T (✓) position 1
- R (must be in 2,3,4 – here R is 2) – but R was in 2 before and feedback said R is in word but wrong position (from TRIPS: R was 2, feedback –). So R cannot be 2. Thus invalid.

Valid word: “TRAGI” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAIK” – ends with K.

Valid word: “TRAJI” – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAKS” – ends with S, but R is in 2 – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAMS” – ends with S, M is new, but R is 2 – invalid.

Valid word: “TRAPS” – P is out.

Valid word: “TARDS” – as above, T A R D S – A in 2 (invalid).

Valid word: “TARIS” – invalid.

Valid word: “TAROK” – ends with K.

Valid word: “TAROS” – invalid.

Valid word: “TARPS” – invalid.

Valid word: “TARSI” – ends with I.

Valid word: “TARSO” – invalid.

Valid word: “TARSI” – ends with I.

Valid word: “TARSI” – ends with I.

Valid word: “TARSI” – ends with I.

Wait, let’s systematically list positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed: T _ _ _ S

Letters to place: A, R, I in 2,3,4
- A cannot be 1,2 – so 3 or 4
- R cannot be 1,2 – so 3 or 4
- I cannot be 3 – so 2 or 4

Possible placements:
- I in 2, A in 3 or 4
- I in 4, A in 3 or 4 (but A can’t be 4 if I is 4, because then A would have to be 3)

Let’s try:
I in 2, A in 3: T I A _ S
Need R in 4: T I A R S → “TIARS” – invalid
Need R in 3: T I R A S → “TIaras” – invalid

I in 2, A in 4: T I _ A S
Need R in 3: T I R A S → “TIARA” – but A is 4, which is allowed (only ruled out 1,2 for A), R is 3 (allowed), S is 5 (fixed).

“TIARA” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- T (✓) position 1
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I was wrong only in 3)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was wrong only in 1,2)
- A in position 4 (allowed, since A was wrong only in 1,2)
- Second S is already fixed in 5.

This fits all constraints.

Let’s use “TIARA”.
