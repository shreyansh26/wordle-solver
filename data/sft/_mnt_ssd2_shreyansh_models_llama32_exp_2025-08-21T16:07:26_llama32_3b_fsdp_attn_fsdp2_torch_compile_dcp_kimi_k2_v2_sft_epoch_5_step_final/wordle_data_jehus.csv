### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Key deductions so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: S, E
- We also know:
  – S is not in position 1 (from STEIN) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  – E is not in position 3 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must:
- Contain both S and E.
- Place S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Place E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Use only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S and E).

I want a guess that puts S and E in new positions and introduces fresh common consonants. A good candidate is “SHELF”:
- S is in position 1 → but we already know S is not in position 1 (from STEIN feedback). So that’s bad.

Next candidate: “LSES” – but it repeats S and has S in position 3 and 4, which is inefficient for placement.

Another candidate: “SPELK” – but K is uncommon and we’d like to test more common letters.

Better: “SHELF” was invalid because S starts in position 1. Let’s try “E” in position 1 and S in position 2: “E S _ _ _”. A common word fitting this is “ESCAL” – but A and L are already questionable.

Let’s try “S” in position 3 and “E” in position 4: “_ _ S E _”. A common word: “BUSED” – but U and D are still possible.

But we need to avoid U and D for now because they’re less common. Instead, let’s use “MUSED” – but again U and D.

Let’s go back to basics: place S in position 2 and E in position 3 (invalid positions for both). Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 1: “E S _ _ _”. A common word: “ESSEX” – but X is rare.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 2: “_ E _ _ S”. A common word: “BEGUM” – but U and M are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 4: “_ _ S E _”. A common word: “FUSED” – U and D are still uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 1: “E _ S _ _”. A common word: “EASEL” – A and L are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 3: “_ S E _ _”. A common word: “FLESH” – F, L, H are still possible.

Yes! FLESH:
- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 2 (new position).
- E is in position 3 (new position).
- Letters F, L, H are all new and common enough.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, I, N) are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Key deductions so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: S, E
- We also know:
  – S is not in position 1 (from STEIN) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  – E is not in position 3 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must:
- Contain both S and E.
- Place S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Place E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Use only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S and E).

I want a guess that puts S and E in new positions and introduces fresh common consonants. A good candidate is “SHELF”:
- S is in position 1 → but we already know S is not in position 1 (from STEIN feedback). So that’s bad.

Next candidate: “LSES” – but it repeats S and has S in position 3 and 4, which is inefficient for placement.

Another candidate: “SPELK” – but K is uncommon and we’d like to test more common letters.

Better: “SHELF” was invalid because S starts in position 1. Let’s try “E” in position 1 and S in position 2: “E S _ _ _”. A common word fitting this is “ESCAL” – but A and L are already questionable.

Let’s try “S” in position 3 and “E” in position 4: “_ _ S E _”. A common word: “BUSED” – but U and D are still possible.

But we need to avoid U and D for now because they’re less common. Instead, let’s use “MUSED” – but again U and D.

Let’s go back to basics: place S in position 2 and E in position 3 (invalid positions for both). Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 1: “E S _ _ _”. A common word: “ESSEX” – but X is rare.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 2: “_ E _ _ S”. A common word: “BEGUM” – but U and M are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 4: “_ _ S E _”. A common word: “FUSED” – U and D are still uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 4: “_ S _ E _”. A common word: “HUMPS” – U, M, P, S, T. T is already out, so no.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 1: “E _ _ _ S”. A common word: “ELBOW” – O is out.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 2: “_ E S _ _”. A common word: “BESOM” – O is out.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 3: “_ S E _ _”. A common word: “HOUSE” – O and U are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 4: “_ _ _ E S”. A common word: “GUESS” – U and G are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 1: “E _ S _ _”. A common word: “EASEL” – A and L are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 3: “_ S E _ _”. A common word: “FLESH” – F, L, H are still possible.

Yes! FLESH:
- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 2 (new position).
- E is in position 3 (new position).
- Letters F, L, H are all new and common enough.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, I, N) are used.

This seems optimal.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, H  
(Notice: in FLESH, H is marked “-” – it is in the word but not in position 5.)

We also have positional constraints so far:
- S is NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from AROSE and STEIN and FLESH).
  So S must be in position 2 or 3.
- E is NOT in positions 3, 5 (from AROSE and STEIN and FLESH).
  So E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- H is NOT in position 5 (from FLESH).
  So H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E (with the above positional rules).
2. Contains H somewhere (again with positional rules).
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, E, H).

Let’s list possible positions for S, E, H:

Possible slots:
- S can be in 2 or 3
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4
- H can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need to place S, E, H without violating these positions.

Try building a word:
- If S is in 2, then E must be in 1 or 4.
  - E in 1: E S _ _ _  → need H in 3 or 4.
    - E S H _ _ → ES_H_ – a 5-letter word: “ESHER” (but that’s not common).
    - E S _ H _ → ES_H_ – nothing common.
  - E S _ _ E → but E is already in 2, so E S _ _ E – H must be in 3 or 4.
    - E S H _ E → “ESH_E” – “ESHE” is 4 letters.
    - E S _ H E → “ESHE” is 4 letters.
    - “SEHE” is 4 letters.

- If S is in 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4.
  - E in 1: E _ S _ _ → H must be in 2, 4.
    - E H S _ _ → “EHSAN” – not common.
    - E _ S H _ → “EUSHY” – but Y is possible.
    - “EUSHY” – contains U, S, H, Y. U is still allowed, Y is allowed.
      Check constraints:
      - S in 3 (allowed)
      - E in 1 (allowed)
      - H in 4 (allowed)
      - Letters U, Y are new but not forbidden.
      “EUSHY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L are absent. Good.

So “EUSHY” satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another possible word: “PUSES” – but repeats S and has S in 3 and 4, which is inefficient for placement.

“PUSES” is invalid (repeats S).

“PUSES” → no.

“EUSHY” seems the best so far.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both S and E (but S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
2. Excludes A, R, O entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, H, M, Y, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STEIN"" because:
- It includes both S and E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- It uses new common letters T, I, N to gather more information.
- It avoids A, R, O as required.

    - E S H _ _ → ES_H_ – a 5-letter word: “ESHER” (but that’s not common).
    - E S _ H _ → ES_H_ – nothing common.
  - E S _ _ E → but E is already in 2, so E S _ _ E – H must be in 3 or 4.
    - E S H _ E → “ESH_E” – “ESHE” is 4 letters.
    - E S _ H E → “ESHE” is 4 letters.
    - “SEHE” is 4 letters.

- If S is in 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4.
  - E in 1: E _ S _ _ → H must be in 2, 4.
    - E H S _ _ → “EHSAN” – not common.
    - E _ S H _ → “EUSHY” – but Y is possible.
    - “EUSHY” – contains U, S, H, Y. U is still allowed, Y is allowed.
      Check constraints:
      - S in 3 (allowed)
      - E in 1 (allowed)
      - H in 4 (allowed)
      - Letters U, Y are new but not forbidden.
      “EUSHY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L are absent. Good.

So “EUSHY” satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another possible word: “PUSES” – but repeats S and has S in 3 and 4, which is inefficient for placement.

“PUSES” is invalid (repeats S).

“PUSES” → no.

“EUSHY” seems the best so far.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both S and E (but S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
2. Excludes A, R, O entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, H, M, Y, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STEIN"" because:
- It includes both S and E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- It uses new common letters T, I, N to gather more information.
- It avoids A, R, O as required.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 2: STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Key deductions so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: S, E
- We also know:
  – S is not in position 1 (from STEIN) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  – E is not in position 3 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must:
- Contain both S and E.
- Place S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Place E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Use only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S and E).

I want a guess that puts S and E in new positions and introduces fresh common consonants. A good candidate is “SHELF”:
- S is in position 1 → but we already know S is not in position 1 (from STEIN feedback). So that’s bad.

Next candidate: “LSES” – but it repeats S and has S in position 3 and 4, which is inefficient for placement.

Another candidate: “SPELK” – but K is uncommon and we’d like to test more common letters.

Better: “SHELF” was invalid because S starts in position 1. Let’s try “E” in position 1 and S in position 2: “E S _ _ _”. A common word fitting this is “ESCAL” – but A and L are already questionable.

Let’s try “S” in position 3 and “E” in position 4: “_ _ S E _”. A common word: “BUSED” – but U and D are still possible.

But we need to avoid U and D for now because they’re less common. Instead, let’s use “MUSED” – but again U and D.

Let’s go back to basics: place S in position 2 and E in position 3 (invalid positions for both). Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 1: “E S _ _ _”. A common word: “ESSEX” – but X is rare.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 2: “_ E _ _ S”. A common word: “BEGUM” – but U and M are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 4: “_ _ S E _”. A common word: “FUSED” – U and D are still uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 4: “_ S _ E _”. A common word: “HUMPS” – U, M, P, S, T. T is already out, so no.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 1: “E _ _ _ S”. A common word: “ELBOW” – O is out.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 2: “_ E S _ _”. A common word: “BESOM” – O is out.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 3: “_ S E _ _”. A common word: “HOUSE” – O and U are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 5 and E in position 4: “_ _ _ E S”. A common word: “GUESS” – U and G are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 3 and E in position 1: “E _ S _ _”. A common word: “EASEL” – A and L are uncertain.

Let’s try S in position 2 and E in position 3: “_ S E _ _”. A common word: “FLESH” – F, L, H are still possible.

Yes! FLESH:
- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 2 (new position).
- E is in position 3 (new position).
- Letters F, L, H are all new and common enough.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, I, N) are used.

This seems optimal.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: FLESH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) E(-) S(-) H(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, H  
(Notice: in FLESH, H is marked “-” – it is in the word but not in position 5.)

We also have positional constraints so far:
- S is NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from AROSE and STEIN and FLESH).
  So S must be in position 2 or 3.
- E is NOT in positions 3, 5 (from AROSE and STEIN and FLESH).
  So E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- H is NOT in position 5 (from FLESH).
  So H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E (with the above positional rules).
2. Contains H somewhere (again with positional rules).
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, E, H).

Let’s list possible positions for S, E, H:

Possible slots:
- S can be in 2 or 3
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4
- H can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need to place S, E, H without violating these positions.

Try building a word:
- If S is in 2, then E must be in 1 or 4.
  - E in 1: E S _ _ _  → need H in 3 or 4.
    - E S H _ _ → ES_H_ – a 5-letter word: “ESHER” (but that’s not common).
    - E S _ H _ → ES_H_ – nothing common.
  - E S _ _ E → but E is already in 2, so E S _ _ E – H must be in 3 or 4.
    - E S H _ E → “ESH_E” – “ESHE” is 4 letters.
    - E S _ H E → “ESHE” is 4 letters.
    - “SEHE” is 4 letters.

- If S is in 3, then E can be in 1, 2, or 4.
  - E in 1: E _ S _ _ → H must be in 2, 4.
    - E H S _ _ → “EHSAN” – not common.
    - E _ S H _ → “EUSHY” – but Y is possible.
    - “EUSHY” – contains U, S, H, Y. U is still allowed, Y is allowed.
      Check constraints:
      - S in 3 (allowed)
      - E in 1 (allowed)
      - H in 4 (allowed)
      - Letters U, Y are new but not forbidden.
      “EUSHY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L are absent. Good.

So “EUSHY” satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another possible word: “PUSES” – but repeats S and has S in 3 and 4, which is inefficient for placement.

“PUSES” is invalid (repeats S).

“PUSES” → no.

“EUSHY” seems the best so far.

From all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, H, U  
(Notice: in EUSHY, U was marked “-” – it is in the word but not in position 2.)

Exact positional constraints so far:
- S is NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from AROSE, STEIN, FLESH, EUSHY).
  So S must be in position 2 or 3.
- E is NOT in positions 3, 5 (from AROSE, STEIN, FLESH, EUSHY).
  So E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- H is NOT in position 5 (from FLESH, EUSHY).
  So H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- U is NOT in position 2 (from EUSHY).
  So U must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, H, U.
2. Places S in 2 or 3.
3. Places E in 1, 2, or 4.
4. Places H in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. Places U in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
6. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus S, E, H, U).

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2
Then E must be in 1 or 4.
Sub-case 1a: E in 1
Word pattern: E S _ _ _
Need H and U in positions 3,4,5 with:
- H not in 5 (already) and not in 4 (from EUSHY feedback: H was “-” in position 4).
So H must be in 3.
U must be in 4 or 5.
Possible words:
- E S H U _ → “ESHU_” – no common 5-letter word.
- E S H _ U → “ESH_U” – “ESHU” is 4 letters.
- E S _ H U → “ES_HU” – “ESHU” is 4 letters.
- E S _ U H → “ES_UH” – “ESUH” is not a word.

Sub-case 1b: E in 4
Word pattern: _ S E _ _
H must be in 1, 2, or 5. But 2 is S, 3 is E, so H must be in 1 or 5.
U must be in 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 1 or 5.
- H in 1, U in 5 → H S E _ U → “HSE_U” – “SEHU” is not a word.
- H in 1, U in 3 → H S E U _ – “HSENU” – no.
- H in 5, U in 1 → U S E _ H → “USE_H” – “USESH” is not a word.

Case 2: S in position 3
Then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.
Sub-case 2a: E in 1
Word pattern: E _ S _ _
H must be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 5 because E is in 1).
U must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is S), so 4 or 5.
Possible:
- E _ S H U → “EHSU_” – “EHSUN” is 5 letters but “EHSUN” is not a word.
- E _ S U H → “EUS_H” – “EUSH_” – “EUSHY” already tried.
- _ E S H U → “_ESHU” – “BESHU” is not a word.
- _ S E H U → “_SEHU” – “DSEHU” is not a word.

Sub-case 2b: E in 2
Word pattern: _ E S _ _
H must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 because E is in 2).
U must be in 1, 4, or 5.
Possible:
- H E S _ U → “HES_U” – “HESNU” is not a word.
- H E S U _ → “HESU_” – “HESU_” – no.
- _ E S H U → “_ESHU” – no.
- U E S _ H → “UESH_” – “UESHY” is not a word.

Sub-case 2c: E in 4
Word pattern: _ _ S E _
H must be in 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
U must be in 1, 2, 5 (3 is S, 4 is E).
Possible:
- H _ S E _ → “H_S_E_” – “HUSKE” – K is allowed, but “HUSKE” has K, E, S, H, U.
  Check constraints:
  - S in 3 (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - H in 1 (allowed)
  - U in 2 (allowed)
  - K is new and allowed.
  “HUSKE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: H, U, S, K, E – all allowed.
- S is in 3 (allowed).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- H is in 1 (allowed).
- U is in 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, “HUSKE” is a valid next guess.

From all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, L, K, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, H, U  
(Notice: in HUSKE, U was marked “-” – it is in the word but not in position 2.)

Exact positional constraints so far:
- S is NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from AROSE, STEIN, FLESH, EUSHY, HUSKE).
  So S must be in position 2 or 3.
- E is NOT in positions 3, 5 (from AROSE, STEIN, FLESH, EUSHY, HUSKE).
  So E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- H is NOT in position 5 (from FLESH, EUSHY, HUSKE).
  So H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- U is NOT in position 2 (from EUSHY, HUSKE).
  So U must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, H, U.
2. Places S in 2 or 3.
3. Places E in 1, 2, or 4.
4. Places H in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. Places U in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
6. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus S, E, H, U).

Let’s build the pattern:

Case 1: S in position 2
Then E must be in 1 or 4.
Sub-case 1a: E in 1
Pattern: E S _ _ _
H must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 5).
U must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but 2 is S).
So:
- E S H U _ → “ESHU_” – no common word.
- E S _ H U → “ESHU_” – nothing.
- E S _ U H → “ESUH_” – “ESUH” is 4 letters.

Sub-case 1b: E in 4
Pattern: _ S E _ _
H must be in 1, 2, or 5 (2 is S, 3 is E).
U must be in 1, 5 (3 is E).
So:
- H S E _ U → “HSE_U” – “HSENU” is not a word.
- _ S E H U → “_SEHU” – “DSEHU” is not a word.
- _ S E U H → “_SEUH” – “BSEUH” is not a word.

Case 2: S in position 3
Then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.
Sub-case 2a: E in 1
Pattern: E _ S _ _
H must be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 5).
U must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is S).
So:
- E H S _ U → “EHS_U” – “EHSNU” is not a word.
- E _ S H U → “E_SHU” – “EUSHU” is not a word.
- _ E S _ H → “_ES_H” – “DES_H” – “DESH” is 4 letters.
- _ _ S E H → “_SE_H” – “BSE_H” – “BESHU” is not a word.

Sub-case 2b: E in 2
Pattern: _ E S _ _
H must be in 1, 4, or 5 (2 is E, 3 is S).
U must be in 1, 4, or 5.
So:
- H E S _ U → “HES_U” – “HESNU” is not a word.
- _ E S H U → “_ESHU” – “BESHU” is not a word.
- _ E S U H → “_ESUH” – “BESUH” is not a word.
- U E S _ H → “UES_H” – “UESHH” is not a word.

Sub-case 2c: E in 4
Pattern: _ _ S E _
H must be in 1, 2, or 5 (2 is S, 3 is E, 4 is E – wait, 4 is E).
Hence H must be in 1 or 5.
U must be in 1, 3, 5 (3 is S, 4 is E).
So:
- H _ S E _ → H _ S E _ – need U in 5.
  Pattern: H _ S E U → “H_S_EU” → “HUSHE” – but H is in 1 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), U in 5 (allowed).
  Check if “HUSHE” is a word – yes, it’s a valid variant spelling of “hush” (past tense of “hush” as a verb).

Let’s verify:
- Letters: H, U, S, H, E – but we have two H’s, which is allowed.
- S is in 3 (allowed).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- H is in 1 (allowed).
- U is in 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, “HUSHE” satisfies all constraints.

But wait – in HUSHE, the first H is in position 1 (allowed), the second H is in position 4 (allowed), and we have S, E, U as required.

However, let me double-check another common word to ensure we have the best.

Another candidate: “PUSES” – but repeats S and has S in 3 and 4, which is inefficient.

“PUSES” is invalid.

“HUSHE” seems the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But let me think of another: “DUSHY” – but Y is out.

“BUSHY” – Y is out.

“MUSHY” – Y is out.

“PUSHE” – H is in 4 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed).
Check if “PUSHE” is a word – yes, it’s a valid word (past participle of “push”).

Let’s compare:
- PUSHE: P, U, S, H, E.
- HUSHE: H, U, S, H, E.

Both are valid, but “PUSHE” uses P and H, while “HUSHE” uses H and U. Both are equally valid logically, but “PUSHE” introduces P, which is common.

I’ll go with “PUSHE” as it’s a common word and fits all constraints.
