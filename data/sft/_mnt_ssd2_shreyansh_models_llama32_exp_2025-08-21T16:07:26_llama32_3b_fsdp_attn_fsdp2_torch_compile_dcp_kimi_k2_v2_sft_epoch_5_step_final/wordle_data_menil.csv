### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would use U, N, T, I, E:
- E is in the word (confirmed).
- U, N, T, I are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 here, but since feedback said E is in wrong position (was 5th in AROSE), placing it in position 1-4 is fine.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th again - same position as first guess, which is bad since we know E is not in 5th. So need to change.

Better choice: ""LINED""
- Uses L, I, N, E, D.
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Tests new common letters.

Another good option: ""MIXED""
- E is in position 3.
- Tests M, I, X, D.

""MIXED"" seems slightly better as it tests more common letters (M, I, X) and E in position 3.

But let's go with ""LINED"" since it uses very common letters and keeps E in new positions.

Wait, actually ""LINED"" has E in position 4 - that's fine. But before finalizing, let's consider ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th - that's not good. So ""LINED"" is good.

Final choice: ""LINED""

- I is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- The word has N in position 3.
- It contains E, I, L, but not in positions 4, 2, 1 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, S, D.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: U (since A, O are out, I is in, E is in).

Possible structure: _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 (but respecting the exclusions).

Good candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) and I is in 2 (forbidden).
- ""LINED"" – already tried, D is out.
- ""ELINT"" – but T is untested, E in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.
- ""INLET"" – I in 1 (allowed), N in 3 (✓), L in 4 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden). Bad.
- ""UNTIL"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), T in 4, I in 5. But L must be in the word somewhere and we haven't placed it yet. Also, U is new.

- ""LINER"" – but R is out.
- ""LINED"" – already done, D out.
- ""ELINT"" – I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Better approach: place N in 3, and distribute E, I, L in allowed positions.
Positions allowed:

- I not in 2 → can be in 1,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 1,4,5.

But ""UNTIE"" has E in 2, which is allowed. However, we also have I in 5 (allowed) and L must be placed. We haven't placed L yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would use U, N, T, I, E:
- E is in the word (confirmed).
- U, N, T, I are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 here, but since feedback said E is in wrong position (was 5th in AROSE), placing it in position 1-4 is fine.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th again - same position as first guess, which is bad since we know E is not in 5th. So need to change.

Better choice: ""LINED""
- Uses L, I, N, E, D.
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Tests new common letters.

Another good option: ""MIXED""
- E is in position 3.
- Tests M, I, X, D.

""MIXED"" seems slightly better as it tests more common letters (M, I, X) and E in position 3.

But let's go with ""LINED"" since it uses very common letters and keeps E in new positions.

Wait, actually ""LINED"" has E in position 4 - that's fine. But before finalizing, let's consider ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th - that's not good. So ""LINED"" is good.

Final choice: ""LINED""

<guess>LINED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
- A, R, O, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: LINED → L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has N in position 3.
- It contains E, I, L, but not in positions 4, 2, 1 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, S, D.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: U (since A, O are out, I is in, E is in).

Possible structure: _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 (but respecting the exclusions).

Good candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) and I is in 2 (forbidden).
- ""LINED"" – already tried, D is out.
- ""ELINT"" – but T is untested, E in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.
- ""INLET"" – I in 1 (allowed), N in 3 (✓), L in 4 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden). Bad.
- ""UNTIL"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), T in 4, I in 5. But L must be in the word somewhere and we haven't placed it yet. Also, U is new.

Wait, we must include L. Let's try:
- ""LUNGI"" – but G is uncommon, and U is new.
- ""LINER"" – but R is out.
- ""LINED"" – already done, D out.
- ""ELINT"" – I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Better approach: place N in 3, and distribute E, I, L in allowed positions.
Positions allowed:
- E not in 4 or 5 → can be in 1,2,3, but 3 is N, so 1 or 2.
- I not in 2 → can be in 1,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 1,4,5.
- L not in 1 → can be in 2,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 2,4,5.

Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U(1), N(3), T(4), I(5), E(2) – but E cannot be in 2 (from LINED feedback, E was in 4 then 5, but 4 is forbidden, so 2 is allowed). Wait, LINED had E in 4 (forbidden), 5 (forbidden), so E can be in 1,2,3. But 3 is N, so 1 or 2.

But ""UNTIE"" has E in 2, which is allowed. However, we also have I in 5 (allowed) and L must be placed. We haven't placed L yet. 

Actually, let's construct:
We have _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L to place in positions 1,2,4,5 respecting constraints.

Possible word: ""ELINT"" – but I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Another approach: ""UNTIL"" – but L is missing.

Wait, we must include L. Let's try:
""ELINT"" – but I in 2 (forbidden).

""LINER"" – R is out.

""UNLIT"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), L in 2 (allowed), I in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed). This seems good:
- U is new.
- N is in 3 (✓).
- L in 2 (allowed).
- I in 4 (allowed).
- T in 5 (allowed).

And we haven't used U, T, L, I yet.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - N is in position 3 (✓).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from this we add that E is also not in 5, since in AROSE it was in 5 and in LINED in 4, so 1,2,3 are possible for E).

3. UNLIT → U(x) N(-) L(-) I(✓) T(x)
   - U is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know from LINED it is in position 3, so this is consistent).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent with LINED).
   - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - T is not in the word.

So far:
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: I (✓)
- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N, but I and N are already placed.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T.
- Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E, L (but only 1 each so far).

We have: _ _ N I _ with E and L still to place, and they must go in positions 1 or 2 or 5 (but respecting their exclusions):
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.
- L cannot be in 1, 3, 5 → must be in 2.

So L must be in 2, and E must be in 1.

Thus the word structure is: E L N I _

But we have 5 letters and positions:
- 1: E (confirmed)
- 2: L (confirmed)
- 3: N (confirmed)
- 4: I (confirmed)
- 5: ?

But we've used E, L, N, I. We need one more letter. From unused common letters, good candidates are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- E L N I B → ""ELINB"" – not a valid word.
- E L N I C → ""ELINC"" – not valid.
- E L N I D → D is out.
- E L N I F → ""ELINF"" – no.
- E L N I G → ""ELING"" – no.
- E L N I H → ""ELINH"" – no.
- E L N I K → ""ELINK"" – no.
- E L N I M → ""ELINM"" – no.
- E L N I P → ""ELINP"" – no.
- E L N I Q → ""ELINQ"" – no.
- E L N I R → R is out.
- E L N I S → S is out.
- E L N I V → ""ELINV"" – no.
- E L N I W → ""ELINW"" – no.
- E L N I X → ""ELINX"" – no.
- E L N I Y → ""ELINY"" – no.
- E L N I Z → ""ELINZ"" – no.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word starting E L N I _.

Actually, the structure is: E L N I _ with one more letter needed in position 5.

But we've placed E, L, N, I. The fifth letter must be new. Let's think of valid 5-letter words starting with E L N I:

- ""ELINT"" – but T is out.
- ""ELINK"" – not valid.
- ""ELINB"" – no.

Hmm, seems like ""ELINT"" was the only possibility, but T is out. Let me reconsider:

We have E L N I _ and need a 5th letter. Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- ""ELINT"" – T is out.
- ""ELINK"" – not valid.
- ""ELINB"" – no.
- ""ELING"" – no.

Wait, maybe ""ELFIN"" – but F is allowed. Let's check:
- E L N I F – ""ELFIN"" is a valid word!

Let's verify:
- E: position 1 – allowed (not excluded).
- L: position 2 – allowed (not excluded).
- N: position 3 – confirmed ✓.
- I: position 4 – confirmed ✓.
- F: new letter, not previously tested.

This fits all constraints.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would use U, N, T, I, E:
- E is in the word (confirmed).
- U, N, T, I are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 here, but since feedback said E is in wrong position (was 5th in AROSE), placing it in position 1-4 is fine.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th again - same position as first guess, which is bad since we know E is not in 5th. So need to change.

Better choice: ""LINED""
- Uses L, I, N, E, D.
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Tests new common letters.

Another good option: ""MIXED""
- E is in position 3.
- Tests M, I, X, D.

""MIXED"" seems slightly better as it tests more common letters (M, I, X) and E in position 3.

But let's go with ""LINED"" since it uses very common letters and keeps E in new positions.

Wait, actually ""LINED"" has E in position 4 - that's fine. But before finalizing, let's consider ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th - that's not good. So ""LINED"" is good.

Final choice: ""LINED""

<guess>LINED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
- A, R, O, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: LINED → L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has N in position 3.
- It contains E, I, L, but not in positions 4, 2, 1 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, S, D.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: U (since A, O are out, I is in, E is in).

Possible structure: _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 (but respecting the exclusions).

Good candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) and I is in 2 (forbidden).
- ""LINED"" – already tried, D is out.
- ""ELINT"" – but T is untested, E in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.
- ""INLET"" – I in 1 (allowed), N in 3 (✓), L in 4 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden). Bad.
- ""UNTIL"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), T in 4, I in 5. But L must be in the word somewhere and we haven't placed it yet. Also, U is new.

Wait, we must include L. Let's try:
- ""LUNGI"" – but G is uncommon, and U is new.
- ""LINER"" – but R is out.
- ""LINED"" – already done, D out.
- ""ELINT"" – I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Better approach: place N in 3, and distribute E, I, L in allowed positions.
Positions allowed:
- E not in 4 or 5 → can be in 1,2,3, but 3 is N, so 1 or 2.
- I not in 2 → can be in 1,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 1,4,5.
- L not in 1 → can be in 2,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 2,4,5.

Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U(1), N(3), T(4), I(5), E(2) – but E cannot be in 2 (from LINED feedback, E was in 4 then 5, but 4 is forbidden, so 2 is allowed). Wait, LINED had E in 4 (forbidden), 5 (forbidden), so E can be in 1,2,3. But 3 is N, so 1 or 2.

But ""UNTIE"" has E in 2, which is allowed. However, we also have I in 5 (allowed) and L must be placed. We haven't placed L yet. 

Actually, let's construct:
We have _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L to place in positions 1,2,4,5 respecting constraints.

Possible word: ""ELINT"" – but I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Another approach: ""UNTIL"" – but L is missing.

Wait, we must include L. Let's try:
""ELINT"" – but I in 2 (forbidden).

""LINER"" – R is out.

""UNLIT"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), L in 2 (allowed), I in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed). This seems good:
- U is new.
- N is in 3 (✓).
- L in 2 (allowed).
- I in 4 (allowed).
- T in 5 (allowed).

And we haven't used U, T, L, I yet.

<guess>UNLIT</guess>

<guess>UNLIT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
Guess 3: UNLIT -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) L(-) I(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - N is in position 3 (✓).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from this we add that E is also not in 5, since in AROSE it was in 5 and in LINED in 4, so 1,2,3 are possible for E).

3. UNLIT → U(x) N(-) L(-) I(✓) T(x)
   - U is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know from LINED it is in position 3, so this is consistent).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent with LINED).
   - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - T is not in the word.

So far:
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: I (✓)
- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N, but I and N are already placed.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T.
- Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E, L (but only 1 each so far).

We have: _ _ N I _ with E and L still to place, and they must go in positions 1 or 2 or 5 (but respecting their exclusions):
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.
- L cannot be in 1, 3, 5 → must be in 2.

So L must be in 2, and E must be in 1.

Thus the word structure is: E L N I _

But we have 5 letters and positions:
- 1: E (confirmed)
- 2: L (confirmed)
- 3: N (confirmed)
- 4: I (confirmed)
- 5: ?

But we've used E, L, N, I. We need one more letter. From unused common letters, good candidates are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- E L N I B → ""ELINB"" – not a valid word.
- E L N I C → ""ELINC"" – not valid.
- E L N I D → D is out.
- E L N I F → ""ELINF"" – no.
- E L N I G → ""ELING"" – no.
- E L N I H → ""ELINH"" – no.
- E L N I K → ""ELINK"" – no.
- E L N I M → ""ELINM"" – no.
- E L N I P → ""ELINP"" – no.
- E L N I Q → ""ELINQ"" – no.
- E L N I R → R is out.
- E L N I S → S is out.
- E L N I V → ""ELINV"" – no.
- E L N I W → ""ELINW"" – no.
- E L N I X → ""ELINX"" – no.
- E L N I Y → ""ELINY"" – no.
- E L N I Z → ""ELINZ"" – no.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word starting E L N I _.

Actually, the structure is: E L N I _ with one more letter needed in position 5.

But we've placed E, L, N, I. The fifth letter must be new. Let's think of valid 5-letter words starting with E L N I:

- ""ELINT"" – but T is out.
- ""ELINK"" – not valid.
- ""ELINB"" – no.

Hmm, seems like ""ELINT"" was the only possibility, but T is out. Let me reconsider:

We have E L N I _ and need a 5th letter. Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- ""ELINT"" – T is out.
- ""ELINK"" – not valid.
- ""ELINB"" – no.
- ""ELING"" – no.

Wait, maybe ""ELFIN"" – but F is allowed. Let's check:
- E L N I F – ""ELFIN"" is a valid word!

Let's verify:
- E: position 1 – allowed (not excluded).
- L: position 2 – allowed (not excluded).
- N: position 3 – confirmed ✓.
- I: position 4 – confirmed ✓.
- F: new letter, not previously tested.

This fits all constraints.

Let's update the state after the four guesses.

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word:
   - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from UNLIT and ELFIN feedback).
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from ELFIN feedback: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 1).
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from ELFIN feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 2).
   - From LINED: N is in position 3 (✓), but UNLIT and ELFIN also mention N(-) which seems to conflict. However, re-reading: 
     - LINED: N(✓) means N is correct in position 3.
     - UNLIT: N(-) means N is in the word but wrong position. This contradicts LINED where N(✓) said N is correct in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
       - N(✓) in LINED means N is correct in position 3.
       - N(-) in UNLIT means N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which is consistent with N being in position 3).
       - N(-) in ELFIN means N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (also consistent with N in position 3).

So:
- Position 3: N (fixed).
- Position 4: I (fixed from ELFIN).
- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.
Constraints:
- E must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,4,5 and 3 is N).
- L must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2,3,4).
- Position 5 can be any remaining letter, but must be new (since we've used E, L, I, N).

Thus the word structure is: _ E N I _ with L in 1 or 5, and one more letter in the remaining slot.

Possible words:
- L E N I _ → but then we need a 5th letter. Valid words: ""LENIA"" (but A is out), ""LENDS"" (S is out), ""LENTE"" (T is out), ""LENKI"" (K is allowed). ""LENKI"" is valid.
- _ E N I L → but then position 1 would need a new letter, and position 5 would be L. Valid word: ""INEL"" – but that's 4 letters. Needing 5 letters, the only possibility is ""INEL"" plus a letter, but we've used I, N, E, L. The only valid word fitting is ""INELK"" – but that's not a word. Actually, ""INEL"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word with structure _ E N I L.

Wait, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ E N I L is ""HENIL"" – but H hasn't been tested and is allowed. However, ""HENIL"" is not a valid English word.

Re-evaluate: we have _ E N I _ with L in 5. The fifth letter must be new and valid. Possible words:
- ""BENIX"" – but X is allowed, but ""BENIX"" is not common.
- ""VENIL"" – V is allowed, but ""VENIL"" is not a word.
- ""MENIA"" – A is out.
- ""PENIC"" – C is allowed, and ""PENIC"" is a valid word!

""PENIC"" fits:
- P (new, allowed).
- E in 2 (allowed).
- N in 3 (fixed).
- I in 4 (fixed).
- C in 5 (new, allowed).

Let's verify:
- P: new, allowed.
- E: allowed in 2.
- N: fixed in 3.
- I: fixed in 4.
- C: new, allowed.

This seems correct.

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word:
   - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from UNLIT and ELFIN feedback).
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from ELFIN feedback: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 1).
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from ELFIN feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 2).
   - From LINED: N is in position 3 (✓), but UNLIT and ELFIN also mention N(-) which seems to conflict. However, re-reading: 
     - LINED: N(✓) means N is correct in position 3.
     - UNLIT: N(-) means N is in the word but wrong position. This contradicts LINED where N(✓) said N is correct in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
       - N(✓) in LINED means N is correct in position 3.
       - N(-) in UNLIT means N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which is consistent with N being in position 3).
       - N(-) in ELFIN means N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (also consistent with N in position 3).

So:
- Position 3: N (fixed).
- Position 4: I (fixed from ELFIN).
- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.
Constraints:
- E must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,4,5 and 3 is N).
- L must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2,3,4).
- Position 5 can be any remaining letter, but must be new (since we've used E, L, I, N).

Thus the word structure is: _ E N I _ with L in 1 or 5, and one more letter in the remaining slot.

Possible words:
- L E N I _ → but then we need a 5th letter. Valid words: ""LENIA"" (but A is out), ""LENDS"" (S is out), ""LENTE"" (T is out), ""LENKI"" (K is allowed). ""LENKI"" is valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would use U, N, T, I, E:
- E is in the word (confirmed).
- U, N, T, I are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 here, but since feedback said E is in wrong position (was 5th in AROSE), placing it in position 1-4 is fine.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th again - same position as first guess, which is bad since we know E is not in 5th. So need to change.

Better choice: ""LINED""
- Uses L, I, N, E, D.
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Tests new common letters.

Another good option: ""MIXED""
- E is in position 3.
- Tests M, I, X, D.

""MIXED"" seems slightly better as it tests more common letters (M, I, X) and E in position 3.

But let's go with ""LINED"" since it uses very common letters and keeps E in new positions.

Wait, actually ""LINED"" has E in position 4 - that's fine. But before finalizing, let's consider ""UNTIE"" has E in 5th - that's not good. So ""LINED"" is good.

Final choice: ""LINED""

<guess>LINED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
- A, R, O, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: LINED → L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has N in position 3.
- It contains E, I, L, but not in positions 4, 2, 1 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, S, D.

Letters we still need to test: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: U (since A, O are out, I is in, E is in).

Possible structure: _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 (but respecting the exclusions).

Good candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) and I is in 2 (forbidden).
- ""LINED"" – already tried, D is out.
- ""ELINT"" – but T is untested, E in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.
- ""INLET"" – I in 1 (allowed), N in 3 (✓), L in 4 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden). Bad.
- ""UNTIL"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), T in 4, I in 5. But L must be in the word somewhere and we haven't placed it yet. Also, U is new.

Wait, we must include L. Let's try:
- ""LUNGI"" – but G is uncommon, and U is new.
- ""LINER"" – but R is out.
- ""LINED"" – already done, D out.
- ""ELINT"" – I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Better approach: place N in 3, and distribute E, I, L in allowed positions.
Positions allowed:
- E not in 4 or 5 → can be in 1,2,3, but 3 is N, so 1 or 2.
- I not in 2 → can be in 1,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 1,4,5.
- L not in 1 → can be in 2,3,4,5, but 3 is N, so 2,4,5.

Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U(1), N(3), T(4), I(5), E(2) – but E cannot be in 2 (from LINED feedback, E was in 4 then 5, but 4 is forbidden, so 2 is allowed). Wait, LINED had E in 4 (forbidden), 5 (forbidden), so E can be in 1,2,3. But 3 is N, so 1 or 2.

But ""UNTIE"" has E in 2, which is allowed. However, we also have I in 5 (allowed) and L must be placed. We haven't placed L yet. 

Actually, let's construct:
We have _ _ N _ _ with E, I, L to place in positions 1,2,4,5 respecting constraints.

Possible word: ""ELINT"" – but I in 2 (forbidden), L in 3 (but N must be in 3), so no.

Another approach: ""UNTIL"" – but L is missing.

Wait, we must include L. Let's try:
""ELINT"" – but I in 2 (forbidden).

""LINER"" – R is out.

""UNLIT"" – U in 1, N in 3 (✓), L in 2 (allowed), I in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed). This seems good:
- U is new.
- N is in 3 (✓).
- L in 2 (allowed).
- I in 4 (allowed).
- T in 5 (allowed).

And we haven't used U, T, L, I yet.

<guess>UNLIT</guess>

<guess>UNLIT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
Guess 3: UNLIT -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) L(-) I(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - N is in position 3 (✓).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from this we add that E is also not in 5, since in AROSE it was in 5 and in LINED in 4, so 1,2,3 are possible for E).

3. UNLIT → U(x) N(-) L(-) I(✓) T(x)
   - U is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know from LINED it is in position 3, so this is consistent).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent with LINED).
   - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - T is not in the word.

So far:
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: I (✓)
- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N, but I and N are already placed.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T.
- Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E, L (but only 1 each so far).

We have: _ _ N I _ with E and L still to place, and they must go in positions 1 or 2 or 5 (but respecting their exclusions):
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.
- L cannot be in 1, 3, 5 → must be in 2.

So L must be in 2, and E must be in 1.

Thus the word structure is: E L N I _

But we have 5 letters and positions:
- 1: E (confirmed)
- 2: L (confirmed)
- 3: N (confirmed)
- 4: I (confirmed)
- 5: ?

But we've used E, L, N, I. We need one more letter. From unused common letters, good candidates are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- E L N I B → ""ELINB"" – not a valid word.
- E L N I C → ""ELINC"" – not valid.
- E L N I D → D is out.
- E L N I F → ""ELINF"" – no.
- E L N I G → ""ELING"" – no.
- E L N I H → ""ELINH"" – no.
- E L N I K → ""ELINK"" – no.
- E L N I M → ""ELINM"" – no.
- E L N I P → ""ELINP"" – no.
- E L N I Q → ""ELINQ"" – no.
- E L N I R → R is out.
- E L N I S → S is out.
- E L N I V → ""ELINV"" – no.
- E L N I W → ""ELINW"" – no.
- E L N I X → ""ELINX"" – no.
- E L N I Y → ""ELINY"" – no.
- E L N I Z → ""ELINZ"" – no.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word starting E L N I _.

Actually, the structure is: E L N I _ with one more letter needed in position 5.

But we've placed E, L, N, I. The fifth letter must be new. Let's think of valid 5-letter words starting with E L N I:

- ""ELINT"" – but T is out.
- ""ELINK"" – not valid.
- ""ELINB"" – no.

Hmm, seems like ""ELINT"" was the only possibility, but T is out. Let me reconsider:

We have E L N I _ and need a 5th letter. Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- ""ELINT"" – T is out.
- ""ELINK"" – not valid.
- ""ELINB"" – no.
- ""ELING"" – no.

Wait, maybe ""ELFIN"" – but F is allowed. Let's check:
- E L N I F – ""ELFIN"" is a valid word!

Let's verify:
- E: position 1 – allowed (not excluded).
- L: position 2 – allowed (not excluded).
- N: position 3 – confirmed ✓.
- I: position 4 – confirmed ✓.
- F: new letter, not previously tested.

This fits all constraints.

<guess>ELFIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
Guess 3: UNLIT -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) L(-) I(✓) T(x)
Guess 4: ELFIN -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) F(x) I(✓) N(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's update the state after the four guesses.

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word:
   - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from UNLIT and ELFIN feedback).
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from ELFIN feedback: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 1).
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from ELFIN feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 2).
   - From LINED: N is in position 3 (✓), but UNLIT and ELFIN also mention N(-) which seems to conflict. However, re-reading: 
     - LINED: N(✓) means N is correct in position 3.
     - UNLIT: N(-) means N is in the word but wrong position. This contradicts LINED where N(✓) said N is correct in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
       - N(✓) in LINED means N is correct in position 3.
       - N(-) in UNLIT means N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which is consistent with N being in position 3).
       - N(-) in ELFIN means N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (also consistent with N in position 3).

So:
- Position 3: N (fixed).
- Position 4: I (fixed from ELFIN).
- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.
Constraints:
- E must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,4,5 and 3 is N).
- L must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2,3,4).
- Position 5 can be any remaining letter, but must be new (since we've used E, L, I, N).

Thus the word structure is: _ E N I _ with L in 1 or 5, and one more letter in the remaining slot.

Possible words:
- L E N I _ → but then we need a 5th letter. Valid words: ""LENIA"" (but A is out), ""LENDS"" (S is out), ""LENTE"" (T is out), ""LENKI"" (K is allowed). ""LENKI"" is valid.
- _ E N I L → but then position 1 would need a new letter, and position 5 would be L. Valid word: ""INEL"" – but that's 4 letters. Needing 5 letters, the only possibility is ""INEL"" plus a letter, but we've used I, N, E, L. The only valid word fitting is ""INELK"" – but that's not a word. Actually, ""INEL"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word with structure _ E N I L.

Wait, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ E N I L is ""HENIL"" – but H hasn't been tested and is allowed. However, ""HENIL"" is not a valid English word.

Re-evaluate: we have _ E N I _ with L in 5. The fifth letter must be new and valid. Possible words:
- ""BENIX"" – but X is allowed, but ""BENIX"" is not common.
- ""VENIL"" – V is allowed, but ""VENIL"" is not a word.
- ""MENIA"" – A is out.
- ""PENIC"" – C is allowed, and ""PENIC"" is a valid word!

""PENIC"" fits:
- P (new, allowed).
- E in 2 (allowed).
- N in 3 (fixed).
- I in 4 (fixed).
- C in 5 (new, allowed).

Let's verify:
- P: new, allowed.
- E: allowed in 2.
- N: fixed in 3.
- I: fixed in 4.
- C: new, allowed.

This seems correct.

This contradicts LINED where N(✓) said N is correct in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:\n       - N(✓) in LINED means N is correct in position 3.\n       - N(-) in UNLIT means N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which is consistent with N being in position 3).\n       - N(-) in ELFIN means N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (also consistent with N in position 3).\n\nSo:\n- Position 3: N (fixed).\n- Position 4: I (fixed from ELFIN).\n- Letters in the word: E, L, I, N.\n- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F.\n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\nConstraints:\n- E must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,4,5 and 3 is N).\n- L must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2,3,4).\n- Position 5 can be any remaining letter, but must be new (since we\'ve used E, L, I, N).\n\nThus the word structure is: _ E N I _ with L in 1 or 5, and one more letter in the remaining slot.\n\nPossible words:\n- L E N I _ → but then we need a 5th letter. Valid words: ""LENIA"" (but A is out), ""LENDS"" (S is out), ""LENTE"" (T is out), ""LENKI"" (K is allowed). ""LENKI"" is valid.\n- _ E N I L → but then position 1 would need a new letter, and position 5 would be L. Valid word: ""INEL"" – but that\'s 4 letters. Needing 5 letters, the only possibility is ""INEL"" plus a letter, but we\'ve used I, N, E, L. The only valid word fitting is ""INELK"" – but that\'s not a word. Actually, ""INEL"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word with structure _ E N I L.\n\nWait, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ E N I L is ""HENIL"" – but H hasn\'t been tested and is allowed. However, ""HENIL"" is not a valid English word.\n\nRe-evaluate: we have _ E N I _ with L in 5. The fifth letter must be new and valid.

From the new feedback on PENIC:
- P: not in the word (x)
- E: correct in position 2 (✓)
- N: correct in position 3 (✓)
- I: correct in position 4 (✓)
- C: not in the word (x)

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not yet ruled out.
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: N (fixed)
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, D, U, T, F, P, C.

Letters we know ARE in the word: E, L, I, N.

From earlier:
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,4 → must be in position 5.
- E is already placed in position 2.
- I in 4, N in 3.

Thus the word must be: _ E N I L.

We just need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern. The only common word is ""HENIL"" (but not valid), ""MENIL"" (not valid), ""VENIL"" (not valid), ""BENIL"" (not valid).

Wait, the correct common word is ""VENIL"" – but that's not valid. Actually, the correct word is ""VENIL"" – no.

Realizing the only valid English word fitting _ E N I L is ""HENIL"" (invalid), ""MENIL"" (invalid), ""BENIL"" (invalid), ""VENIL"" (invalid).

But ""VENIL"" is not a word. The correct word is ""VENIL"" – no.

Upon reflection, the only valid word fitting _ E N I L is ""VENIL"" – but that's not valid.
