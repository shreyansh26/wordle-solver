### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices among Wordle players. 

Looking at these options:
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes the very common letters C, R, A, N, and E, which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are in the word:
- R, A, T, O (each has shown up as “-” at least once, so they’re all present)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- C, N, E, I, D

Positions we have ruled out for each letter:
- R: not 1, 2, 4, 5  ⇒  R must be in position 3
- A: not 2, 3  ⇒  A must be in 1, 4, or 5
- T: not 3, 5  ⇒  T must be in 1, 2, or 4
- O: not 3, 5  ⇒  O must be in 1, 2, or 4

We still need one more letter (since the word is 5 letters and we’ve only placed R so far).  
That extra letter must be one of the unused consonants that are allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to build the word:

We already know:
- Position 3 = R
- We still need to place A, T, O and one new letter.

Try placing A, T, O in positions 1, 2, 4 or 1, 4, 5 etc., while keeping the extra letter.

A promising pattern:
- Position 1 = O
- Position 2 = T
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = A
- Position 5 = new letter (must be allowed)

Word formed: OT R A _  → “OTR A ?”  
We need a 5-letter word matching O T R A _ with the fifth letter not C, N, E, I, D.

Valid options: OTARB (no), OTRAW (no), OTRAM (no), OTRAP (no), OTRAK (no), OTRAW (no)…

Wait, let’s try a different arrangement.

Another pattern:
- Position 1 = A
- Position 2 = T
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = O
- Position 5 = new letter

Word formed: A T R O _  → “ATRO_”

Valid English word: ATROP (no), ATROS (no), ATROG (no)…

Hmm, none of these seem valid.

Try:
- Position 1 = T
- Position 2 = A
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = O
- Position 5 = new letter

Word formed: T A R O _  → “TARO_”

Valid English word: TAROK (no), TAROT (no), TAROP (no)…

Still nothing.

Try:
- Position 1 = T
- Position 2 = O
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = A
- Position 5 = new letter

Word formed: T O R A _  → “TORA_”

Valid English word: TORAH (yes, 5 letters, uses H which is allowed).

Check constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (required)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- H is new and allowed (not in forbidden list)

So the only valid word fitting all constraints is “TORAH”.
