For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct, high-frequency letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word
- It gives us information about 5 different letters right away

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all

3. Uses two new letters to gather more information

Good remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

Let’s try a word that shifts A, R, O and adds two new letters. “TAROC” is invalid (contains C but not a valid word). “RATIO” uses R, A, T, I, O – all valid and informative.

Check positions:
- R (position 1) – allowed since R was not in position 2

- T (position 3) – new letter

- O in position 5 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed since R was not in position 1 or 2)
- C and D are new letters to test.

Thus, CARDO is a good next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, O are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   – S, E are not in the word.

2. RATIO → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(✓)  
   – A is locked in position 2.  
   – O is locked in position 5.  
   – R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
   – T, I are not in the word.

3. CARDO → C(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓) O(✓)  
   – A, R, D, O are all in their correct positions (2, 3, 4, 5).  
   – C is not in the word.

So the pattern is now: _ A R D O.

We need a single letter for the first position that:
- Has not been ruled out yet (not S, E, T, I, C).  
- Forms a valid 5-letter English word with A R D O.

Possible first letters (common, unused so far): B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, W, etc.

Valid words fitting _ A R D O:
- B A R D O – not a standard word.  
- F A R D O – not a word.  
- G A R D O – not a word.  
- H A R D O – not a word.  
- L A R D O – not a word.  
- M A R D O – not a word.  
- N A R D O – not a word.  
- P A R D O – not a word.  
- W A R D O – not a word.  

Wait, let me double-check: the only common English word ending in A R D O is “FARDO” (a variant spelling of “fardo” – a type of dance), but it’s obscure. However, “HARDON” is 6 letters. 

But there’s one clear, common word: “BARDO” (a Himalayan Buddhist text) – though it’s also quite rare. 

Another possibility: “GARDO” – no. 

Actually, the most plausible valid word is “BARDO,” despite its rarity. However, if we’re restricted to common words, we might consider “HARDON” (but it’s 6 letters). 

Rechecking: the only valid 5-letter word with pattern _ A R D O is “BARDO.” 

Therefore, BARDO is the logical next guess.
