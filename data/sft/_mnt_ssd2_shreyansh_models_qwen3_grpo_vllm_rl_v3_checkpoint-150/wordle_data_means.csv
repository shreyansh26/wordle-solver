### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – A is in the word but not in slot 1.
   – R, O are not in the word at all.
   – S is in the word but not in slot 4.
   – E is in the word but not in slot 5.

2. SEATS → S(-) E(✓) A(✓) T(x) S(✓)
   – S is in the word but not in slot 1.
   – E is in slot 2 and is correct.
   – A is in slot 3 and is correct.
   – T is not in the word.
   – The final S is in slot 5 and is correct.

So far we know:
- E is fixed in slot 2.
- A is fixed in slot 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in slots 1, 4, or 5 (from AROSE and SEATS feedback).
  – The only remaining slot for S is slot 3, but slot 3 is already A.
  – This seems like a contradiction, so I must have misread the SEATS feedback.

Wait, let’s re-parse SEATS feedback carefully:

SEATS: positions 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:  S E A T S
Feedback: S(-) E(✓) A(✓) T(x) S(✓)

- Slot 1: S(-) → S is in the word but not here.
- Slot 2: E(✓) → E is correct here.
- Slot 3: A(✓) → A is correct here.
- Slot 4: T(x) → T is not in the word.
- Slot 5: S(✓) → S is correct here.

So:
- E is fixed in slot 2.
- A is fixed in slot 3.
- S is in slot 5 and is correct.
- S cannot be in slots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? No, slot 5 is correct for S.
- From AROSE: S is not in slot 4 (consistent).
- From AROSE: S is in the word but not in slot 4 (already placed in slot 5).

Thus the word pattern so far:
_ E A _ S

Letters confirmed in word: E, A, S
Letters confirmed NOT in word: R, O, T

We need to fill slots 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ E A _ S and uses new common letters. Candidates:

- S cannot be in slots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? No, slot 5 is correct for S.
- From AROSE: S is not in slot 4 (consistent).
- From AROSE: S is in the word but not in slot 4 (already placed in slot 5).

Thus the word pattern so far:
_ E A _ S

Letters confirmed in word: E, A, S
Letters confirmed NOT in word: R, O, T

We need to fill slots 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ E A _ S and uses new common letters. Candidates:
- BEADS (but D is okay, but we already have S at end)
- LEADS (L, D okay)
- MEANS (M, N okay)
- PEAKS (but K not tested, but we have A in slot 3)
- YEARS (but R is out)
- FEAST (but T is out)
- WEASEL (but 5 letters)
- HEARS (but R is out)

Best simple candidates:
- LEADS
- MEANS
- FEARS (but R is out)
- BEADS

Let me pick LEADS:
- L in slot 1 (new)
- E in slot 2 (fixed)
- A in slot 3 (fixed)
- D in slot 4 (new)
- S in slot 5 (fixed)

This tests L and D.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – A is in the word, not in position 1.
   – R, O are not in the word.
   – S is in the word, not in position 4.
   – E is in the word, not in position 5.

2. SEATS → S(-) E(✓) A(✓) T(x) S(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 2.
   – A is fixed in position 3.
   – S is fixed in position 5.
   – T is not in the word.
   – S is not in positions 1 or 4 (consistent).

3. LEADS → L(x) E(✓) A(✓) D(x) S(✓)
   – L and D are not in the word.
   – Confirms E, A, S positions: _ E A _ S.

So the word must be _ E A _ S, with letters in positions 1 and 4 still unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, T, L, D.  
Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English endings “_EAS” are rare, but “_EAS” is valid (e.g., “PEAS” is 4 letters).  
We need a 5-letter word ending in “EAS” with an initial letter and a fourth letter that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- BEAST (but T is out)
- FEARS (R is out)
- HEAPS (P okay, but ends in PS)
- MEANS (N okay, ends in AS)
- YEARS (R out)
- WEASEL (too long)
- CEASE (C okay, ends in EAS)
- PEASE (P okay, ends in EAS)

“CEASE” fits _ E A _ S and uses new letters C and E (but E is already used).  
Wait, “CEASE” is C E A S E, but we have E in position 2 and S in position 5, so it would be C E A _ S, but “CEASE” ends in E, not S.  
Actually, the pattern is _ E A _ S, so we need a word like C E A N S, M E A N S, P E A K S, etc.

“MEANS” is M E A N S – fits _ E A _ S and uses M and N (both new).

“PEANS” is P E A N S – also fits.

“KEANS” is not a valid English word.

“HEAPS” is H E A P S – fits _ E A _ S and uses H and P.

Let’s pick “MEANS” as it’s common and tests M and N.

3. LEADS → L(x) E(✓) A(✓) D(x) S(✓)

So the word must be _ E A _ S, with letters in positions 1 and 4 still unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, T, L, D.  
Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

“PEANS” is P E A N S – also fits.

“KEANS” is not a valid English word.
