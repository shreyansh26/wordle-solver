### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but S is NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Letters we can eliminate: A, R, O, E.
Letters we know are in the word: S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A strong next guess could be ""SUNNY"" but that has N and Y which might not be optimal.
Another option is ""SLING"" but that has L, I, N, G which are all good letters.
Another is ""STING"" which is similar.
""STUMP"" is also good but has U and P which are less common.

I'll go with ""STING"" as it uses S (known to be in the word), T, I, N, G - all common letters not yet eliminated.

From the new feedback on STING:
- S is in the word AND in the correct 1st position (✓).
- T, I, N are NOT in the word (x).
- G is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Starts with S (S _ _ _ _).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Contains G, but G is NOT in the 5th position.

Letters we know:
- Present: S (position 1), G.
- Absent: A, R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing G (not at the end), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible structures: S _ _ G _ or S _ G _ _.

Let's think of words:
- S _ _ G _: SCUBG? No. SPUG? No. SLUG? Contains L, U, G. L and U are allowed, G is allowed but not in 5th position. SLUG has G in 4th position - allowed. But SLUG is 4 letters, needs 5.
- S _ G _ _: SG... but S and G are first two letters, need 3rd letter. SG is start, but need 5 letters.

Let's think of 5-letter words starting with S, containing G (not last), no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- SUGAR: has A and R which are forbidden.
- SUGAR: invalid.
- SULKY: has U, L, K, Y. No G.
- SUGAR: invalid.
- SUGGEST: too long.
- SUGAR: invalid.
- SUGAR: invalid.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need S _ _ _ _ with G somewhere in positions 2,3,4 and no A,R,O,E,T,I,N.

Letters allowed: B,C,D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z plus G.

Possible words:
- S B U G _: SBUG? No.
- S C U G _: SCUG? No.
- S L U G _: SLUG? Needs 5 letters. SLUG + ? SLUGS? That's 5 letters and ends with S. But G is in 4th position here, which is allowed.

SLUGS: S L U G S.
- S is in correct position 1 (✓).
- G is in position 4 (not 5, so allowed).
- Letters used: S, L, U, G, S. No forbidden letters.
- This seems valid.

Another option: S P U G _: SPUG? No.
S C U G _: SCUG? No.
S H U G _: SHUG? No.
S L U G _: SLUGS is the only 5-letter extension.

SLUGS seems like the best next guess.
