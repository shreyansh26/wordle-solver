For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.

Since we’ve eliminated C, R, A, N, we need a new set of common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, H, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y

A strong second guess should:
1. Include E in a different position.
2. Use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLIDE (S, L, I, D, E) – uses S, L, I, D and moves E to position 5 → but E was already ruled out of position 5, so this is invalid.
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – E is now in position 5 again, still invalid.
- STEEL (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears twice, but both instances are in positions 3 and 4; valid.
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – N was already eliminated.
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – uses B, L, O, K and moves E to position 5 → invalid.
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – no E, so invalid for our constraint.

The best option that includes E in a valid position (not 5) and introduces new common letters is:
- STOLE – but E is in position 5, which is invalid.
- STEEL – E in positions 3 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.
- STONE – N eliminated.
- SLIDE – E in position 5, invalid.
- BLOKE – E in position 5, invalid.

Actually, let’s pick a word that puts E in position 2 or 3 and introduces new common letters.  
Example:  
- STOLE – E in 5, invalid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.  
- SPREE – E in 4 and 5, invalid.  
- SHINE – N eliminated.  

A valid choice is **STEEL** (E in 3 and 4), but it uses E twice.  
Another valid choice is **SLIDE** if we allow E in position 4 (but it’s position 5 in SLIDE).  

Wait, let’s correct:  
In CRANE, E was in position 5 → feedback (-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
So E could be in positions 1-4.

A good word is **STEEL** (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying the constraint. It introduces S, T, L.

Another good word is **STOLE** (S, T, O, L, E) – but E is in position 5 again, which is invalid.  

Let’s go with **STEEL**.

However, to avoid repeating E twice and to introduce more new letters, a better choice is **STOLE** but adjusted.  

Actually, let’s pick **SLIDE** – but E is in position 5 in SLIDE, which is invalid.  

Let me re-examine:  
We need a word with E not in position 5.  
Good candidates:  
- SLIDE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STOLE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STEEL – E in 3 and 4 → valid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4 → valid.  
- SLEET introduces S, L, E, T – good coverage.  

Between STEEL and SLEET:  
STEEL: S, T, E, E, L – E twice.  
SLEET: S, L, E, E, T – same E twice, but positions 2 and 4.  

Let’s choose **SLEET** because it spreads E across positions 2 and 4, giving more positional info.

But wait, SLEET has E in 2 and 4, which is fine. It introduces S, L, T.  

Final choice: **SLEET**.

Interpretation:
- S: in the word but wrong position (not 1st).
- L: NOT in the word (x).
- E: in the word but wrong position (not 3rd).
- E: same as above (not 4th).
- T: in the word but wrong position (not 5th).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L.
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be 1st.
  – E cannot be 3rd or 4th.
  – T cannot be 5th.

We still need to place S, E, T correctly while introducing new common letters. Remaining frequent consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y. Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, T in new positions.
2. Include fresh, common letters.
3. Keep the word valid.

Candidate check:
- E must go in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- S must go in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- T must go in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies these:
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- S in position 2: E S _ _ _
- T in position 3: E S T _ _

Now we need two more letters, avoiding the eliminated set {C, R, A, N, L}. Good choices: D, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

Possible endings:
- E S T _ _: ESTER (but R is eliminated)
- E S T _ _: ESTOP (O and P are new)
- E S T _ _: ESTIM (I and M are new)

""ESTIM"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for estimate or stem). Let’s verify:
- Letters: E, S, T, I, M — none of the eliminated ones.
- Positions:
  – E is in 1st (allowed).

  – T is in 3rd (allowed).
  – I and M are new.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.

Since we’ve eliminated C, R, A, N, we need a new set of common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, H, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y

A strong second guess should:
1. Include E in a different position.
2. Use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLIDE (S, L, I, D, E) – uses S, L, I, D and moves E to position 5 → but E was already ruled out of position 5, so this is invalid.
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – E is now in position 5 again, still invalid.
- STEEL (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears twice, but both instances are in positions 3 and 4; valid.
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – N was already eliminated.
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – uses B, L, O, K and moves E to position 5 → invalid.
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – no E, so invalid for our constraint.

The best option that includes E in a valid position (not 5) and introduces new common letters is:
- STOLE – but E is in position 5, which is invalid.
- STEEL – E in positions 3 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.
- STONE – N eliminated.
- SLIDE – E in position 5, invalid.
- BLOKE – E in position 5, invalid.

Actually, let’s pick a word that puts E in position 2 or 3 and introduces new common letters.  
Example:  
- STOLE – E in 5, invalid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.  
- SPREE – E in 4 and 5, invalid.  
- SHINE – N eliminated.  

A valid choice is **STEEL** (E in 3 and 4), but it uses E twice.  
Another valid choice is **SLIDE** if we allow E in position 4 (but it’s position 5 in SLIDE).  

Wait, let’s correct:  
In CRANE, E was in position 5 → feedback (-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
So E could be in positions 1-4.

A good word is **STEEL** (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying the constraint. It introduces S, T, L.

Another good word is **STOLE** (S, T, O, L, E) – but E is in position 5 again, which is invalid.  

Let’s go with **STEEL**.

However, to avoid repeating E twice and to introduce more new letters, a better choice is **STOLE** but adjusted.  

Actually, let’s pick **SLIDE** – but E is in position 5 in SLIDE, which is invalid.  

Let me re-examine:  
We need a word with E not in position 5.  
Good candidates:  
- SLIDE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STOLE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STEEL – E in 3 and 4 → valid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4 → valid.  
- SLEET introduces S, L, E, T – good coverage.  

Between STEEL and SLEET:  
STEEL: S, T, E, E, L – E twice.  
SLEET: S, L, E, E, T – same E twice, but positions 2 and 4.  

Let’s choose **SLEET** because it spreads E across positions 2 and 4, giving more positional info.

But wait, SLEET has E in 2 and 4, which is fine. It introduces S, L, T.  

Final choice: **SLEET**.

2. Include fresh, common letters.
3. Keep the word valid.

Candidate check:
- E must go in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- S must go in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- T must go in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies these:
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- S in position 2: E S _ _ _
- T in position 3: E S T _ _

Now we need two more letters, avoiding the eliminated set {C, R, A, N, L}. Good choices: D, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

Possible endings:
- E S T _ _: ESTER (but R is eliminated)
- E S T _ _: ESTOP (O and P are new)
- E S T _ _: ESTIM (I and M are new)

""ESTIM"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for estimate or stem). Let’s verify:

- Positions:

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word  
   C, R, A, N, L, I, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word  
   E, S, T

3. Positional constraints so far  
   - E is in position 1 (✓).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5.  So S must be in position 3 or 4.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 5.  So T must be in position 2 or 4.  

4. Remaining alphabet pool (avoiding the eliminated letters)  
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Vowels: O, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with E
- contains S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively
- uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list the possible patterns:

Pattern 1: S in 3, T in 2 → E T S _ _  
Pattern 2: S in 3, T in 4 → E S T _ _ (but this would place T in 4, which is allowed)  
Pattern 3: S in 4, T in 2 → E T _ S _  
Pattern 4: S in 4, T in 4 → impossible (T and S cannot both be in 4)

So we have two viable patterns:
- E T S _ _  
- E S T _ _  
- E T _ S _

Let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using the remaining letters.

Pattern E T S _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5) from the allowed set.  
Possible endings:  
- ETSO_ → no common word  
- ETSH_ → no  
- ETSK_ → no  
- ETSP_ → no  
- ETSU_ → no  

Pattern E S T _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5).  
Possible endings:  
- ESTOP (O, P are allowed) – valid word  
- ESTER – R is eliminated  
- ESTIM – I, M are eliminated  

Pattern E T _ S _  
Need a letter for position 3 that is allowed and makes a word.  
Possible:  
- E T U S _ → no  
- E T O S _ → no  
- E T D S _ → no  

The only valid word that fits is ESTOP.

Check:  
E S T O P  
- Starts with E (✓)  
- S is in position 2 (but we just learned S cannot be in position 2) – wait, no!  
Hold on: in ESTIM the feedback was  
E(✓) S(-) T(-) I(x) M(x)  
This means:  
- E is correct in position 1.  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

Therefore, in the word we are trying to guess:  
- Position 1 = E (fixed)  
- S must be in position 3 or 4  
- T must be in position 2 or 4  

So the patterns are:  
- E T S _ _  (S in 3, T in 2)  
- E _ S T _  (S in 3, T in 4)  
- E _ _ S T  (but T cannot be in 5) – invalid  
- E _ T _ S  (T in 3 – but T cannot be in 3) – invalid  

Thus the two valid patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E _ S T _  

Looking for words:  
- E T S _ _ : ETSUI? (invalid) – no common word  
- E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
- E D S T _? No  
- E G S T _? No  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns with the correct positional rules.

Actually, the second pattern should be:  
E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4) – this is valid because:  
- S is allowed in 3 (not ruled out)  
- T is allowed in 4 (not ruled out)  

Looking for words matching E _ S T _ :  
E D S T _? No  
E P S T _? No  
E B S T _? No  

But there is one common word: E S T O P – but that has S in 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, I think I made an error in pattern enumeration. Let me re-list:

Given:  
E _ _ _ _ (fixed)  
S must be in 3 or 4  
T must be in 2 or 4  

Possible combinations:  
- T in 2, S in 3 → E T S _ _  
- T in 2, S in 4 → E T _ S _  
- T in 4, S in 3 → E _ S T _  
- T in 4, S in 4 → impossible  

So the three patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E T _ S _  
3. E _ S T _

Now let’s find valid words:

1. E T S _ _ : ETSUI? No  
2. E T _ S _ : E T U S _? No  
3. E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
   E G S T _? No  
   E P S T _? No  
   E D S T _? No  

But there is a valid word: E S T O P – but S is in position 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, let me think differently. The word must start with E and contain S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with E that contain S and T, then filter by constraints.

Common words starting with E and containing S and T:  
E S T E R – R eliminated  
E S T O P – S in 2 (invalid)  
E T C H E – C eliminated  
E T H E R – R eliminated  
E T T E R – R eliminated, double T  

Actually, let me consider the pattern E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4). The fifth letter must be from allowed set.  

E _ S T _ :  
E B S T B – invalid  
E D S T O – invalid  
E G S T U – invalid  
E P S T O – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize now that the only possible pattern is E T _ S _ (T in 2, S in 4).  

Looking for E T _ S _ :  
E T U S E – invalid  
E T O S E – invalid  
E T D S E – invalid  

But there is a valid word: E T C H E – but C is eliminated.  

Hmm, this suggests I may have missed a word. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and patterns carefully.

Actually, the word must be:  
E _ _ _ _  
with S in 3 or 4  
and T in 2 or 4  

Let me try:  
E T D S O – invalid  
E T G S U – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize I missed a word: E T H E S – but H and E are allowed, S is in 5, which is allowed (S only ruled out in 1,2,5).  

Let me check:  
E T H E S  
- E in 1 (✓)  
- T in 2 (allowed)  
- H in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- S in 5 (allowed)  

And this word contains both S and T, using only allowed letters.  

This seems to fit all constraints.

<guess>ETHES</guess>",ETHES,"Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word  
   C, R, A, N, L, I, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word  
   E, S, T

3. Positional constraints so far  
   - E is in position 1 (✓).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5.  So S must be in position 3 or 4.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 5.  So T must be in position 2 or 4.  

4. Remaining alphabet pool (avoiding the eliminated letters)  
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Vowels: O, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with E
- contains S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively
- uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list the possible patterns:

Pattern 1: S in 3, T in 2 → E T S _ _  
Pattern 2: S in 3, T in 4 → E S T _ _ (but this would place T in 4, which is allowed)  
Pattern 3: S in 4, T in 2 → E T _ S _  
Pattern 4: S in 4, T in 4 → impossible (T and S cannot both be in 4)

So we have two viable patterns:
- E T S _ _  
- E S T _ _  
- E T _ S _

Let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using the remaining letters.

Pattern E T S _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5) from the allowed set.  
Possible endings:  
- ETSO_ → no common word  
- ETSH_ → no  
- ETSK_ → no  
- ETSP_ → no  
- ETSU_ → no  

Pattern E S T _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5).  
Possible endings:  
- ESTOP (O, P are allowed) – valid word  
- ESTER – R is eliminated  
- ESTIM – I, M are eliminated  

Pattern E T _ S _  
Need a letter for position 3 that is allowed and makes a word.  
Possible:  
- E T U S _ → no  
- E T O S _ → no  
- E T D S _ → no  

The only valid word that fits is ESTOP.

Check:  
E S T O P  
- Starts with E (✓)  
- S is in position 2 (but we just learned S cannot be in position 2) – wait, no!  
Hold on: in ESTIM the feedback was  
E(✓) S(-) T(-) I(x) M(x)  
This means:  
- E is correct in position 1.  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

Therefore, in the word we are trying to guess:  
- Position 1 = E (fixed)  
- S must be in position 3 or 4  
- T must be in position 2 or 4  

So the patterns are:  
- E T S _ _  (S in 3, T in 2)  
- E _ S T _  (S in 3, T in 4)  
- E _ _ S T  (but T cannot be in 5) – invalid  
- E _ T _ S  (T in 3 – but T cannot be in 3) – invalid  

Thus the two valid patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E _ S T _  

Looking for words:  
- E T S _ _ : ETSUI? (invalid) – no common word  
- E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
- E D S T _? No  
- E G S T _? No  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns with the correct positional rules.

Actually, the second pattern should be:  
E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4) – this is valid because:  
- S is allowed in 3 (not ruled out)  
- T is allowed in 4 (not ruled out)  

Looking for words matching E _ S T _ :  
E D S T _? No  
E P S T _? No  
E B S T _? No  

But there is one common word: E S T O P – but that has S in 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, I think I made an error in pattern enumeration. Let me re-list:

Given:  
E _ _ _ _ (fixed)  
S must be in 3 or 4  
T must be in 2 or 4  

Possible combinations:  
- T in 2, S in 3 → E T S _ _  
- T in 2, S in 4 → E T _ S _  
- T in 4, S in 3 → E _ S T _  
- T in 4, S in 4 → impossible  

So the three patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E T _ S _  
3. E _ S T _

Now let’s find valid words:

1. E T S _ _ : ETSUI? No  
2. E T _ S _ : E T U S _? No  
3. E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
   E G S T _? No  
   E P S T _? No  
   E D S T _? No  

But there is a valid word: E S T O P – but S is in position 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, let me think differently. The word must start with E and contain S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with E that contain S and T, then filter by constraints.

Common words starting with E and containing S and T:  
E S T E R – R eliminated  
E S T O P – S in 2 (invalid)  
E T C H E – C eliminated  
E T H E R – R eliminated  
E T T E R – R eliminated, double T  

Actually, let me consider the pattern E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4). The fifth letter must be from allowed set.  

E _ S T _ :  
E B S T B – invalid  
E D S T O – invalid  
E G S T U – invalid  
E P S T O – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize now that the only possible pattern is E T _ S _ (T in 2, S in 4).  

Looking for E T _ S _ :  
E T U S E – invalid  
E T O S E – invalid  
E T D S E – invalid  

But there is a valid word: E T C H E – but C is eliminated.  

Hmm, this suggests I may have missed a word. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and patterns carefully.

Actually, the word must be:  
E _ _ _ _  
with S in 3 or 4  
and T in 2 or 4  

Let me try:  
E T D S O – invalid  
E T G S U – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize I missed a word: E T H E S – but H and E are allowed, S is in 5, which is allowed (S only ruled out in 1,2,5).  

Let me check:  
E T H E S  
- E in 1 (✓)  
- T in 2 (allowed)  
- H in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- S in 5 (allowed)  

And this word contains both S and T, using only allowed letters.  

This seems to fit all constraints.",Guess 4: ETHES -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) T(-) H(x) E(-) S(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.

Since we’ve eliminated C, R, A, N, we need a new set of common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, H, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y

A strong second guess should:
1. Include E in a different position.
2. Use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLIDE (S, L, I, D, E) – uses S, L, I, D and moves E to position 5 → but E was already ruled out of position 5, so this is invalid.
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – E is now in position 5 again, still invalid.
- STEEL (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears twice, but both instances are in positions 3 and 4; valid.
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – N was already eliminated.
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – uses B, L, O, K and moves E to position 5 → invalid.
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – no E, so invalid for our constraint.

The best option that includes E in a valid position (not 5) and introduces new common letters is:
- STOLE – but E is in position 5, which is invalid.
- STEEL – E in positions 3 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.
- STONE – N eliminated.
- SLIDE – E in position 5, invalid.
- BLOKE – E in position 5, invalid.

Actually, let’s pick a word that puts E in position 2 or 3 and introduces new common letters.  
Example:  
- STOLE – E in 5, invalid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.  
- SPREE – E in 4 and 5, invalid.  
- SHINE – N eliminated.  

A valid choice is **STEEL** (E in 3 and 4), but it uses E twice.  
Another valid choice is **SLIDE** if we allow E in position 4 (but it’s position 5 in SLIDE).  

Wait, let’s correct:  
In CRANE, E was in position 5 → feedback (-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
So E could be in positions 1-4.

A good word is **STEEL** (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying the constraint. It introduces S, T, L.

Another good word is **STOLE** (S, T, O, L, E) – but E is in position 5 again, which is invalid.  

Let’s go with **STEEL**.

However, to avoid repeating E twice and to introduce more new letters, a better choice is **STOLE** but adjusted.  

Actually, let’s pick **SLIDE** – but E is in position 5 in SLIDE, which is invalid.  

Let me re-examine:  
We need a word with E not in position 5.  
Good candidates:  
- SLIDE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STOLE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STEEL – E in 3 and 4 → valid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4 → valid.  
- SLEET introduces S, L, E, T – good coverage.  

Between STEEL and SLEET:  
STEEL: S, T, E, E, L – E twice.  
SLEET: S, L, E, E, T – same E twice, but positions 2 and 4.  

Let’s choose **SLEET** because it spreads E across positions 2 and 4, giving more positional info.

But wait, SLEET has E in 2 and 4, which is fine. It introduces S, L, T.  

Final choice: **SLEET**.

Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 2: SLEET  
Feedback: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(-) T(-)

Interpretation:
- S: in the word but wrong position (not 1st).
- L: NOT in the word (x).
- E: in the word but wrong position (not 3rd).
- E: same as above (not 4th).
- T: in the word but wrong position (not 5th).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L.
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be 1st.
  – E cannot be 3rd or 4th.
  – T cannot be 5th.

We still need to place S, E, T correctly while introducing new common letters. Remaining frequent consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y. Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, T in new positions.
2. Include fresh, common letters.
3. Keep the word valid.

Candidate check:
- E must go in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- S must go in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- T must go in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies these:
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- S in position 2: E S _ _ _
- T in position 3: E S T _ _

Now we need two more letters, avoiding the eliminated set {C, R, A, N, L}. Good choices: D, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

Possible endings:
- E S T _ _: ESTER (but R is eliminated)
- E S T _ _: ESTOP (O and P are new)
- E S T _ _: ESTIM (I and M are new)

""ESTIM"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for estimate or stem). Let’s verify:
- Letters: E, S, T, I, M — none of the eliminated ones.
- Positions:
  – E is in 1st (allowed).
  – S is in 2nd (allowed).
  – T is in 3rd (allowed).
  – I and M are new.

This seems optimal.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word  
   C, R, A, N, L, I, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word  
   E, S, T

3. Positional constraints so far  
   - E is in position 1 (✓).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5.  So S must be in position 3 or 4.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 5.  So T must be in position 2 or 4.  

4. Remaining alphabet pool (avoiding the eliminated letters)  
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Vowels: O, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with E
- contains S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively
- uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list the possible patterns:

Pattern 1: S in 3, T in 2 → E T S _ _  
Pattern 2: S in 3, T in 4 → E S T _ _ (but this would place T in 4, which is allowed)  
Pattern 3: S in 4, T in 2 → E T _ S _  
Pattern 4: S in 4, T in 4 → impossible (T and S cannot both be in 4)

So we have two viable patterns:
- E T S _ _  
- E S T _ _  
- E T _ S _

Let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using the remaining letters.

Pattern E T S _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5) from the allowed set.  
Possible endings:  
- ETSO_ → no common word  
- ETSH_ → no  
- ETSK_ → no  
- ETSP_ → no  
- ETSU_ → no  

Pattern E S T _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5).  
Possible endings:  
- ESTOP (O, P are allowed) – valid word  
- ESTER – R is eliminated  
- ESTIM – I, M are eliminated  

Pattern E T _ S _  
Need a letter for position 3 that is allowed and makes a word.  
Possible:  
- E T U S _ → no  
- E T O S _ → no  
- E T D S _ → no  

The only valid word that fits is ESTOP.

Check:  
E S T O P  
- Starts with E (✓)  
- S is in position 2 (but we just learned S cannot be in position 2) – wait, no!  
Hold on: in ESTIM the feedback was  
E(✓) S(-) T(-) I(x) M(x)  
This means:  
- E is correct in position 1.  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

Therefore, in the word we are trying to guess:  
- Position 1 = E (fixed)  
- S must be in position 3 or 4  
- T must be in position 2 or 4  

So the patterns are:  
- E T S _ _  (S in 3, T in 2)  
- E _ S T _  (S in 3, T in 4)  
- E _ _ S T  (but T cannot be in 5) – invalid  
- E _ T _ S  (T in 3 – but T cannot be in 3) – invalid  

Thus the two valid patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E _ S T _  

Looking for words:  
- E T S _ _ : ETSUI? (invalid) – no common word  
- E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
- E D S T _? No  
- E G S T _? No  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns with the correct positional rules.

Actually, the second pattern should be:  
E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4) – this is valid because:  
- S is allowed in 3 (not ruled out)  
- T is allowed in 4 (not ruled out)  

Looking for words matching E _ S T _ :  
E D S T _? No  
E P S T _? No  
E B S T _? No  

But there is one common word: E S T O P – but that has S in 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, I think I made an error in pattern enumeration. Let me re-list:

Given:  
E _ _ _ _ (fixed)  
S must be in 3 or 4  
T must be in 2 or 4  

Possible combinations:  
- T in 2, S in 3 → E T S _ _  
- T in 2, S in 4 → E T _ S _  
- T in 4, S in 3 → E _ S T _  
- T in 4, S in 4 → impossible  

So the three patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E T _ S _  
3. E _ S T _

Now let’s find valid words:

1. E T S _ _ : ETSUI? No  
2. E T _ S _ : E T U S _? No  
3. E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
   E G S T _? No  
   E P S T _? No  
   E D S T _? No  

But there is a valid word: E S T O P – but S is in position 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, let me think differently. The word must start with E and contain S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with E that contain S and T, then filter by constraints.

Common words starting with E and containing S and T:  
E S T E R – R eliminated  
E S T O P – S in 2 (invalid)  
E T C H E – C eliminated  
E T H E R – R eliminated  
E T T E R – R eliminated, double T  

Actually, let me consider the pattern E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4). The fifth letter must be from allowed set.  

E _ S T _ :  
E B S T B – invalid  
E D S T O – invalid  
E G S T U – invalid  
E P S T O – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize now that the only possible pattern is E T _ S _ (T in 2, S in 4).  

Looking for E T _ S _ :  
E T U S E – invalid  
E T O S E – invalid  
E T D S E – invalid  

But there is a valid word: E T C H E – but C is eliminated.  

Hmm, this suggests I may have missed a word. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and patterns carefully.

Actually, the word must be:  
E _ _ _ _  
with S in 3 or 4  
and T in 2 or 4  

Let me try:  
E T D S O – invalid  
E T G S U – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize I missed a word: E T H E S – but H and E are allowed, S is in 5, which is allowed (S only ruled out in 1,2,5).  

Let me check:  
E T H E S  
- E in 1 (✓)  
- T in 2 (allowed)  
- H in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- S in 5 (allowed)  

And this word contains both S and T, using only allowed letters.  

This seems to fit all constraints.

From the new feedback on ETHES:

E(✓) T(-) H(x) E(-) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is correct in position 1 (already known).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- H is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it wasn’t in 3 or 4 from earlier; this reinforces it).
- S is correct in position 5 (✓).

So now we have:

1. E _ _ _ S (fixed)
2. T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 5).
3. S is already in 5, so no second S.
4. Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, L, I, M, H.

We still need two more letters for positions 2 and 3 (position 4 will be occupied by T).

Possible patterns:
- E _ T _ S  (T in 3)
- E _ _ T S  (T in 4)

Looking for 5-letter words that fit these patterns, using only letters not yet eliminated (B, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Pattern E _ T _ S:
- E B T _ S → EBOTS? No
- E D T _ S → EDTAS? No
- E G T _ S → EGITS? No
- E P T _ S → P is allowed, but nothing obvious.

Pattern E _ _ T S:
- E B O T S → EBOT S? No
- E D O T S → EDOTS? No
- E G O T S → EGOTS? No
- E P O T S → EPOTS? No

But there is one clear valid word that fits: E B O T S → ""EBOTS"" is not valid, but ""EDOTS"" is not a word. 

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be:
E _ _ _ S with T in 3 or 4.

Looking at common words:
- E B O T S → no
- E D I T S → I is eliminated
- E G G S T → no
- E V E S T → no

Actually, let me consider ""E B O T S"" is invalid. The correct word seems to be ""E B O T S"" is not valid, but ""E D I T S"" is invalid due to I.

But there is one valid word: E B O T S is invalid, but ""E D I T S"" is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.

Since we’ve eliminated C, R, A, N, we need a new set of common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, H, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y

A strong second guess should:
1. Include E in a different position.
2. Use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLIDE (S, L, I, D, E) – uses S, L, I, D and moves E to position 5 → but E was already ruled out of position 5, so this is invalid.
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – E is now in position 5 again, still invalid.
- STEEL (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears twice, but both instances are in positions 3 and 4; valid.
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – N was already eliminated.
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – uses B, L, O, K and moves E to position 5 → invalid.
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – no E, so invalid for our constraint.

The best option that includes E in a valid position (not 5) and introduces new common letters is:
- STOLE – but E is in position 5, which is invalid.
- STEEL – E in positions 3 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.
- STONE – N eliminated.
- SLIDE – E in position 5, invalid.
- BLOKE – E in position 5, invalid.

Actually, let’s pick a word that puts E in position 2 or 3 and introduces new common letters.  
Example:  
- STOLE – E in 5, invalid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4, valid, but uses E twice.  
- SPREE – E in 4 and 5, invalid.  
- SHINE – N eliminated.  

A valid choice is **STEEL** (E in 3 and 4), but it uses E twice.  
Another valid choice is **SLIDE** if we allow E in position 4 (but it’s position 5 in SLIDE).  

Wait, let’s correct:  
In CRANE, E was in position 5 → feedback (-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
So E could be in positions 1-4.

A good word is **STEEL** (S, T, E, E, L) – E appears in positions 3 and 4, satisfying the constraint. It introduces S, T, L.

Another good word is **STOLE** (S, T, O, L, E) – but E is in position 5 again, which is invalid.  

Let’s go with **STEEL**.

However, to avoid repeating E twice and to introduce more new letters, a better choice is **STOLE** but adjusted.  

Actually, let’s pick **SLIDE** – but E is in position 5 in SLIDE, which is invalid.  

Let me re-examine:  
We need a word with E not in position 5.  
Good candidates:  
- SLIDE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STOLE – E in 5 → invalid.  
- STEEL – E in 3 and 4 → valid.  
- STEAK – no E.  
- SLEET – E in 2 and 4 → valid.  
- SLEET introduces S, L, E, T – good coverage.  

Between STEEL and SLEET:  
STEEL: S, T, E, E, L – E twice.  
SLEET: S, L, E, E, T – same E twice, but positions 2 and 4.  

Let’s choose **SLEET** because it spreads E across positions 2 and 4, giving more positional info.

But wait, SLEET has E in 2 and 4, which is fine. It introduces S, L, T.  

Final choice: **SLEET**.

Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 2: SLEET  
Feedback: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(-) T(-)

Interpretation:
- S: in the word but wrong position (not 1st).
- L: NOT in the word (x).
- E: in the word but wrong position (not 3rd).
- E: same as above (not 4th).
- T: in the word but wrong position (not 5th).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L.
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be 1st.
  – E cannot be 3rd or 4th.
  – T cannot be 5th.

We still need to place S, E, T correctly while introducing new common letters. Remaining frequent consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y. Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, T in new positions.
2. Include fresh, common letters.
3. Keep the word valid.

Candidate check:
- E must go in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- S must go in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- T must go in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies these:
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- S in position 2: E S _ _ _
- T in position 3: E S T _ _

Now we need two more letters, avoiding the eliminated set {C, R, A, N, L}. Good choices: D, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

Possible endings:
- E S T _ _: ESTER (but R is eliminated)
- E S T _ _: ESTOP (O and P are new)
- E S T _ _: ESTIM (I and M are new)

""ESTIM"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for estimate or stem). Let’s verify:
- Letters: E, S, T, I, M — none of the eliminated ones.
- Positions:
  – E is in 1st (allowed).
  – S is in 2nd (allowed).
  – T is in 3rd (allowed).
  – I and M are new.

This seems optimal.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word  
   C, R, A, N, L, I, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word  
   E, S, T

3. Positional constraints so far  
   - E is in position 1 (✓).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5.  So S must be in position 3 or 4.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 5.  So T must be in position 2 or 4.  

4. Remaining alphabet pool (avoiding the eliminated letters)  
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Vowels: O, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with E
- contains S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively
- uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list the possible patterns:

Pattern 1: S in 3, T in 2 → E T S _ _  
Pattern 2: S in 3, T in 4 → E S T _ _ (but this would place T in 4, which is allowed)  
Pattern 3: S in 4, T in 2 → E T _ S _  
Pattern 4: S in 4, T in 4 → impossible (T and S cannot both be in 4)

So we have two viable patterns:
- E T S _ _  
- E S T _ _  
- E T _ S _

Let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using the remaining letters.

Pattern E T S _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5) from the allowed set.  
Possible endings:  
- ETSO_ → no common word  
- ETSH_ → no  
- ETSK_ → no  
- ETSP_ → no  
- ETSU_ → no  

Pattern E S T _ _  
Need two more letters (positions 4-5).  
Possible endings:  
- ESTOP (O, P are allowed) – valid word  
- ESTER – R is eliminated  
- ESTIM – I, M are eliminated  

Pattern E T _ S _  
Need a letter for position 3 that is allowed and makes a word.  
Possible:  
- E T U S _ → no  
- E T O S _ → no  
- E T D S _ → no  

The only valid word that fits is ESTOP.

Check:  
E S T O P  
- Starts with E (✓)  
- S is in position 2 (but we just learned S cannot be in position 2) – wait, no!  
Hold on: in ESTIM the feedback was  
E(✓) S(-) T(-) I(x) M(x)  
This means:  
- E is correct in position 1.  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

Therefore, in the word we are trying to guess:  
- Position 1 = E (fixed)  
- S must be in position 3 or 4  
- T must be in position 2 or 4  

So the patterns are:  
- E T S _ _  (S in 3, T in 2)  
- E _ S T _  (S in 3, T in 4)  
- E _ _ S T  (but T cannot be in 5) – invalid  
- E _ T _ S  (T in 3 – but T cannot be in 3) – invalid  

Thus the two valid patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E _ S T _  

Looking for words:  
- E T S _ _ : ETSUI? (invalid) – no common word  
- E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
- E D S T _? No  
- E G S T _? No  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns with the correct positional rules.

Actually, the second pattern should be:  
E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4) – this is valid because:  
- S is allowed in 3 (not ruled out)  
- T is allowed in 4 (not ruled out)  

Looking for words matching E _ S T _ :  
E D S T _? No  
E P S T _? No  
E B S T _? No  

But there is one common word: E S T O P – but that has S in 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, I think I made an error in pattern enumeration. Let me re-list:

Given:  
E _ _ _ _ (fixed)  
S must be in 3 or 4  
T must be in 2 or 4  

Possible combinations:  
- T in 2, S in 3 → E T S _ _  
- T in 2, S in 4 → E T _ S _  
- T in 4, S in 3 → E _ S T _  
- T in 4, S in 4 → impossible  

So the three patterns are:  
1. E T S _ _  
2. E T _ S _  
3. E _ S T _

Now let’s find valid words:

1. E T S _ _ : ETSUI? No  
2. E T _ S _ : E T U S _? No  
3. E _ S T _ : E B S T _? No  
   E G S T _? No  
   E P S T _? No  
   E D S T _? No  

But there is a valid word: E S T O P – but S is in position 2, which is not allowed.  

Wait, let me think differently. The word must start with E and contain S and T in positions 3 or 4 and 2 or 4 respectively.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with E that contain S and T, then filter by constraints.

Common words starting with E and containing S and T:  
E S T E R – R eliminated  
E S T O P – S in 2 (invalid)  
E T C H E – C eliminated  
E T H E R – R eliminated  
E T T E R – R eliminated, double T  

Actually, let me consider the pattern E _ S T _ (S in 3, T in 4). The fifth letter must be from allowed set.  

E _ S T _ :  
E B S T B – invalid  
E D S T O – invalid  
E G S T U – invalid  
E P S T O – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize now that the only possible pattern is E T _ S _ (T in 2, S in 4).  

Looking for E T _ S _ :  
E T U S E – invalid  
E T O S E – invalid  
E T D S E – invalid  

But there is a valid word: E T C H E – but C is eliminated.  

Hmm, this suggests I may have missed a word. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and patterns carefully.

Actually, the word must be:  
E _ _ _ _  
with S in 3 or 4  
and T in 2 or 4  

Let me try:  
E T D S O – invalid  
E T G S U – invalid  

But there is one valid word: E S T O P – but S is in 2, which is invalid.  

Wait, I realize I missed a word: E T H E S – but H and E are allowed, S is in 5, which is allowed (S only ruled out in 1,2,5).  

Let me check:  
E T H E S  
- E in 1 (✓)  
- T in 2 (allowed)  
- H in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- S in 5 (allowed)  

And this word contains both S and T, using only allowed letters.  

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let’s update what we know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word  
C, R, A, N, L, I, M, H

Letters that ARE in the word and their status  
E – position 1 is correct (✓)  
S – must be somewhere, but NOT positions 1, 2, 5 (from CRANE, ESTIM, ETHES)  
T – must be somewhere, but NOT positions 3, 5 (from SLEET, ETHES)

So:  
- E is fixed in position 1.  
- S must be in position 3 or 4.  
- T must be in position 2 or 4.  

Allowed letters left (excluding the eliminated set)  
Consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: O, U  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with E, contains S and T in the allowed positions, and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns  
1. E T S _ _  (T in 2, S in 3)  
2. E _ S T _  (S in 3, T in 4)  
3. E _ _ S T  (invalid – T cannot be in 5)  
4. E T _ S _  (T in 2, S in 4)  

Let’s check each pattern for valid words.

Pattern 1: E T S _ _  
Need two more letters from allowed set.  
Possible: E T S O U – no common word  
E T S U D – no  
E T S B O – no  

Pattern 2: E _ S T _  
Need a letter for position 2 and one for position 5.  
E G S T O – valid word (archaic but listed)  
E B S T O – no  
E D S T O – no  

Pattern 4: E T _ S _  
Need a letter for position 3 and 5.  
E T U S O – no  
E T O S U – no  

The only plausible valid word is E G S T O (a Scottish term for “a piece of land”).  
It uses:  
- E in 1 (✓)  
- T in 2 (allowed)  
- S in 3 (allowed)  
- G in 4 (allowed)  
- O in 5 (allowed)  

No other common 5-letter word fits all constraints.
