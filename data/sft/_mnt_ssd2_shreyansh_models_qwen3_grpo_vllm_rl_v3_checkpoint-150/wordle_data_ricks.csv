### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P.

Positions we have ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from AROSE and STIRP).
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 1 (from AROSE and STIRP).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STIRP).

We still need to place R, S, I correctly.  
We also want to introduce new common letters (N, L, D, etc.) while avoiding the eliminated ones.

A good next guess should:
1. Use R, S, I in still-allowed positions.
2. Add new common consonants and vowels.
3. Keep the word valid and common.

Candidate: “NIRS” + one new letter → “NIRSD” is invalid (not a word).  
Try “SINRL” – invalid.  
Instead, “RINSE” uses R, I, S but E is eliminated.  
Try “SIRIN” – invalid.

Try “CRISP” – P is eliminated.  
Try “BRISK” – B is new, but let’s check positions:

B R I S K  
- B is new.  
- R is in position 2 (but from AROSE, R cannot be in position 2). So BRISK is invalid for R placement.

Try “FRISK” – F is new, R is in position 2 (invalid).  
Try “GRINS” – G is new, R is in position 4 (invalid from AROSE).  
Try “SCRIN” – S is in position 1 (invalid from STIRP).

Try “SIRKS” – K is new, but S is in position 1 (invalid).  
Try “SIRNY” – Y is new, but not common.  
Try “SIRLO” – O is eliminated.  
Try “SIRCH” – not a word.  
Valid word: “SHIRK” – S is in position 1 (invalid), H is new.  
Valid word: “SHIRK” – still S in 1 invalid.

Valid word: “RINSE” – E is eliminated.  
Valid word: “RISIN” – not common.  
Valid word: “RISKS” – S in 5 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed, I in 3 is allowed (only 3 is ruled out, 2,4,5 are allowed).  
Let’s check RISKS:
- R in position 1: allowed (no feedback against it).

We know:
- The word starts with R I _ K S.
- The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant (since all vowels A, O, E, I are either ruled out or placed).
- From earlier rounds, the letters NOT in the word are: A, O, E, T, P, and now we can add any letters that have not been used and are not ruled out (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern R I _ K S:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about letter presence in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, R was in position 2, so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, S was in position 4, so S must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E.
Letters we know ARE in the word: R, S.

Next guess should:
1. Include R and S in new positions.
2. Avoid A, O, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STIRP"" (S, T, I, R, P). This uses S and R in new positions and introduces T, I, P.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P.  
Known letters that ARE in the word: R, S, I.

Positions we have ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from AROSE and STIRP).
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 1 (from AROSE and STIRP).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STIRP).

We still need to place R, S, I correctly.  
We also want to introduce new common letters (N, L, D, etc.) while avoiding the eliminated ones.

A good next guess should:
1. Use R, S, I in still-allowed positions.
2. Add new common consonants and vowels.
3. Keep the word valid and common.

Candidate: “NIRS” + one new letter → “NIRSD” is invalid (not a word).  
Try “SINRL” – invalid.  
Instead, “RINSE” uses R, I, S but E is eliminated.  
Try “SIRIN” – invalid.  
Try “LISNR” – invalid.  
Valid word: “LINER” – uses L, I, N, E, R. But E is eliminated.  
Next valid common word: “DRIPS” – P is eliminated.  
Try “CRISP” – P is eliminated.  
Try “BRISK” – B is new, but let’s check positions:

B R I S K  
- B is new.  
- R is in position 2 (but from AROSE, R cannot be in position 2). So BRISK is invalid for R placement.

Try “FRISK” – F is new, R is in position 2 (invalid).  
Try “GRINS” – G is new, R is in position 4 (invalid from AROSE).  
Try “SCRIN” – S is in position 1 (invalid from STIRP).  
Try “WISPS” – P is eliminated.  
Try “SIRKS” – K is new, but S is in position 1 (invalid).  
Try “SIRNY” – Y is new, but not common.  
Try “SIRLO” – O is eliminated.  
Try “SIRCH” – not a word.  
Valid word: “SHIRK” – S is in position 1 (invalid), H is new.  
Valid word: “SHIRK” – still S in 1 invalid.

Valid word: “RINSE” – E is eliminated.  
Valid word: “RISIN” – not common.  
Valid word: “RISKS” – S in 5 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed, I in 3 is allowed (only 3 is ruled out, 2,4,5 are allowed).  
Let’s check RISKS:
- R in position 1: allowed (no feedback against it).  
- I in position 2: allowed.  
- S in position 5: allowed.  
- K is new.  
- S is duplicated but allowed.

“RISKS” is a valid 5-letter word, uses R, I, S in allowed positions, and introduces K.

Therefore, guess RISKS.

- R I C K S – ""RICKS"" is the most common and likely intended word.

Therefore, the correct word must be RICKS.

<guess>RICKS</guess>",RICKS,"From the four rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

2. STIRP → S(-) T(x) I(-) R(-) P(x)  
   ⇒ S is not in position 1, I is not in position 3, R is not in position 4.

3. RISKS → R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(✓) S(✓)  
   ⇒ R is correctly in position 1, I is correctly in position 2, K is correctly in position 4, and the final S is correctly in position 5.  
   ⇒ The only remaining unknown is position 3.

4. RINKS → R(✓) I(✓) N(x) K(✓) S(✓)  
   ⇒ N is NOT in the word (x in position 3).

So the pattern is still R I _ K S, and the missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, T, P, N.

Possible remaining consonants for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit R I _ K S and whose third letter is not in the ruled-out set:

- R I D K S – not a word.
- R I C K S – ""RICKS"" – valid (plural of rick).
- R I B K S – not a word.
- R I G K S – not a word.
- R I L K S – ""RILKS"" – valid but rare.
- R I M K S – not a word.
- R I H K S – not a word.
- R I C K S – ""RICKS"" is the most common and likely intended word.

Therefore, the correct word must be RICKS.",Guess 5: RICKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
