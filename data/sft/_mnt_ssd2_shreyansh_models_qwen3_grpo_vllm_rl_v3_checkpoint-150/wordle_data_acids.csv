### Game Rules:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good positional coverage of common letters

This should give us good feedback on multiple letters and their positions.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, U, T.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S and D (both marked “-”).
   - S is not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 again (from ADUST), so S must be in position 2 or 3 or 5.
   - D is somewhere in the word except position 2 (from ADUST), so D could be 3, 4, or 5.
4. Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Contains both S and D (each exactly once).
- Does not contain R, O, E, U, T.
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” list.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A straightforward candidate is “ABSID” (short for abside, a church term), but that’s obscure.  
Another is “ADIOS” (but it has an O, which is out).  
“DISKS” has two S’s and is invalid.  
“BASIN” has an N and I, but only one S and one D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good positional coverage of common letters

This should give us good feedback on multiple letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E
3. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
4. Still need to determine the other three letters

Good next letters to test are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Since O and E are out, the remaining vowels are I and U. Common consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 1
- Uses S in a new position (2 or 3 or 5)
- Tests new common letters

A good candidate is ""ASH"" but we need 5 letters. ""ASHES"" is invalid (repeats S). ""ASTIR"" contains R which is out. ""ABUSE"" contains E which is out. 

""ABUZZ"" has Z which is uncommon. ""ADUST"" has U and T, but is 5 letters. 

""ADUST"" seems good:
- A(✓) already
- Tests D, U, S in new positions
- No R, O, E
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this is ok because we're moving S to position 3)

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ADUST -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(-) U(x) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (position 1 fixed).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, U, T.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S and D (both marked “-”).
   - S is not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 again (from ADUST), so S must be in position 2 or 3 or 5.
   - D is somewhere in the word except position 2 (from ADUST), so D could be 3, 4, or 5.
4. Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Contains both S and D (each exactly once).
- Does not contain R, O, E, U, T.
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” list.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A straightforward candidate is “ABSID” (short for abside, a church term), but that’s obscure.  
Another is “ADIOS” (but it has an O, which is out).  
“DISKS” has two S’s and is invalid.  
“BASIN” has an N and I, but only one S and one D.

Actually, “BASIN” doesn’t contain D, so it’s invalid.  
“SANDY” has Y and N, but S is first, which is allowed.

Let me construct a valid word:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must include S and D somewhere after position 1.
- Must exclude R, O, E, U, T.

A good candidate is “ABSID” (A-B-S-I-D).  
- Starts with A.  
- Contains S and D.  
- No forbidden letters.  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- D is in position 5 (allowed).

So I’ll go with “ABSID”.

From the feedback on AVIDS we now know the exact positions of four letters:

A(✓) I(✓) D(✓) S(✓)

So the word looks like:

A _ I D S

The only missing letter is the second position.  
We need a letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters already excluded (x in at least one guess):  
R, O, E, U, T, B, V

Letters already confirmed in the word: A, I, D, S  
So the fifth letter must be one of the remaining unused common letters:  
C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, W, Y

Looking at valid 5-letter English words that match the pattern A _ I D S:

- A C I D S → ACIDS (real word, “acids”)
- A F I D S → not a word
- A G I D S → not a word
- A H I D S → not a word
- A L I D S → not a word
- A M I D S → not a word
- A N I D S → not a word
- A P I D S → not a word
- A W I D S → not a word
- A Y I D S → not a word

The only valid word is ACIDS.
