From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L  
- Letters we know ARE in the word: I (and it is in the 4th position)  
- Letter U is in the word but not in position 1.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
Allowed letters now include U (but not in slot 1) and any other letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, B, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (already confirmed), and we might consider Y as a vowel.

A good next word would place U in a different position and introduce several new consonants.  
“CHUMP” uses C, H, M, P and places U in position 2.  
However, let’s check: C, H, U, M, P – none of these are in the forbidden set, and U is now in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.

But wait – we know I is fixed in position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ I _.  
“CHUMP” is invalid because it has I in position 4, but its structure is C H U M P, which doesn’t fit _ _ _ I _.  
Let me rethink.

We need a 5-letter word with I in the 4th position, no A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, and U somewhere else (not first).

Possible candidates:  
- “CUBIC” – but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet.  
- “MUSIC” – but S is ruled out.  
- “PIVOT” – but O, T are ruled out.  
- “HUMID” – but D is okay, yet L is ruled out.  
- “VIBGY” – not a real word.  
- “MUSIC” – again, S is out.  
- “DUILE” – E is out.  
- “FUMIE” – E is out.  
- “CUPID” – A is out.  
- “MUCID” – A is out.  
- “BUILT” – T, L out.  
- “VIGIL” – L out.  
- “QUIET” – Q, T, E out.  
- “FUGUE” – U, G, E out.  
- “MUSIC” – S out.  
- “PITHY” – T, H, Y okay, but T is out.  
- “DIXIE” – X, E out.  
- “FUGIO” – O out.  
- “VIGOR” – O, R out.  
- “CUPID” – A out.  
- “MUCID” – A out.  
- “BUIER” – R out.  
- “MULCH” – L out.  
- “FUMED” – E out.  
- “CUPID” – A out.  
- “PUDGY” – G, Y okay.  
- “PUDGY” – structure P U D G Y, which is _ _ _ _ _, not _ _ _ I _.  
- “MUDGY” – same issue.  

Let me search for 5-letter words with I in position 4, avoiding forbidden letters.

Examples:  
- “CUBIC” – I is in position 4, letters C, U, B, I, C. Forbidden letters: none of C, U, B are out.

- “QUIET” – Q, T, E out.  
- “FUGUE” – E out.  
- “MUSIC” – S out.  
- “PITHY” – T out.  

“CUBIC” seems the best so far: C, U, B, I, C. It has I in position 4, U in position 2 (not 1), and introduces C, U, B. None of these letters are forbidden.

- “PUDGY” – G, Y okay.  
- “PUDGY” – structure P U D G Y, which is _ _ _ _ _, not _ _ _ I _.  
- “MUDGY” – same issue.  

Let me search for 5-letter words with I in position 4, avoiding forbidden letters.

Examples:  
- “CUBIC” – I is in position 4, letters C, U, B, I, C. Forbidden letters: none of C, U, B are out.  
- “MUSIC” – S out.  
- “DIXIE” – E out.  
- “FUGIO” – O out.  
- “PUDGY” – structure wrong.  
- “MUCID” – A out.  
- “CUPID” – A out.  
- “BUILT” – T, L out.  
- “VIGIL” – L out.  
- “QUIET” – Q, T, E out.  
- “FUGUE” – E out.  
- “MUSIC” – S out.  
- “PITHY” – T out.  

“CUBIC” seems the best so far: C, U, B, I, C. It has I in position 4, U in position 2 (not 1), and introduces C, U, B. None of these letters are forbidden.

Let’s go with CUBIC.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ eliminate A, R, O, S, E.

2. UNTIL → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)  
   ⇒ eliminate N, T, L.  
   ⇒ I is in position 4.  
   ⇒ U is in the word but NOT in position 1.

3. CUBIC → C(-) U(✓) B(x) I(✓) C(-)  
   ⇒ B is eliminated.  
   ⇒ C is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.  
   ⇒ U is in position 2 (✓).  
   ⇒ I is in position 4 (✓).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ U _ I _  (positions 2 and 4 fixed)  
- Letters still allowed: all except A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, B  
  Remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
  Remaining vowels: U (already used), I (already used)  
- C must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 5 are excluded for C from feedback).

Possible candidates:
- C must be in position 3 or 5.  
- Position 1: any remaining consonant (D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z)  
- Position 5: if C is not in position 3, then C must be here.

Let’s list valid words:
1. C in position 3: _ U C I _  
   Possible: DUCIK, FUCID, GUCIO (invalid O), HUCIE (invalid E), KUDIC (invalid C), MUDIC (invalid C), PUDIC (invalid C), VUDIC (invalid C), WUDIC (invalid C), YUDIC (invalid C), ZUDIC (invalid C).  
   Real words: DUCIK (not valid), FUCID (not valid), KUDIC (not valid).  
   Seems no valid real words here.

2. C in position 5: _ U _ I C  
   Possible: DUCKI (invalid), FUMIC (not valid), HUMIC (valid), KUMIC (not valid), MUMIC (not valid), PUDIC (already checked), VUMIC (not valid), WUMIC (not valid), YUMIC (not valid), ZUMIC (not valid).  
   Real word: HUMIC.

Check HUMIC:
- Letters: H, U, M, I, C.  
- All letters allowed (H, M, C are not in forbidden set).  
- Pattern: H U M I C → positions: 1-H, 2-U, 3-M, 4-I, 5-C.  
- C is in position 5 (allowed, since feedback only said C is not in 1 or 5, but here it’s in 5 – wait, feedback said C(-) in positions 1 and 5, meaning C is in word but not in 1 or 5. So C must be in 2,3, or 4. But positions 2 and 4 are fixed as U and I. So C must be in position 3. But we saw no valid words with C in position 3.  
   So HUMIC is invalid because C is in position 5, which was marked as wrong position in CUBIC.

Wait, re-examining CUBIC feedback:
C(-) in position 1 and 5 means C is in word but not in 1 or 5. So C must be in position 3.

Thus word must be: _ U C I _  
But no valid 5-letter words fit _ U C I _ with remaining letters.

Alternative: maybe C is in position 3 and another consonant in position 5.

Possible: D U C I K, F U C I D, G U C I D, H U C I D, M U C I D, P U C I D, V U C I D, W U C I D, Y U C I D, Z U C I D.

Real words: DUCIK (not valid), FUCID (not valid), GUCID (not valid), HUCID (not valid), KUCID (not valid), MUCID (not valid), PUCID (not valid), VUCID (not valid), WUCID (not valid), YUCID (not valid), ZUCID (not valid).

Seems no valid words. Maybe I missed.

Wait, let me re-examine allowed letters:
Forbidden: A,R,O,S,E,N,T,L,B  
Allowed consonants: C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,V,W,Y,Z  
Vowels: only U and I used.

We need _ U _ I _ with C in position 3.

So _ U C I _  
Possible: DUCIK (invalid), FUCID (invalid), GUCID (invalid), HUCID (invalid), KUCID (invalid), MUCID (invalid), PUCID (invalid), VUCID (invalid), WUCID (invalid), YUCID (invalid), ZUCID (invalid).

No valid words. Maybe C is in position 3 and we need a valid consonant in position 5.

Looking up, the only valid word seems to be ""DUCIC"" (not valid), ""FUCID"" (not valid), etc.

Wait, ""MUCID"" is a real word (relating to pus), but M is allowed, U,C,I,D are allowed.

Check MUCID:
- Letters: M, U, C, I, D.  
- All allowed.  
- Pattern: M U C I D → positions: 1-M, 2-U, 3-C, 4-I, 5-D.  
- C is in position 3 (allowed).  
- D is allowed.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- I is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, MUCID is a valid next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- Pattern: _ U _ I _ (U in position 2, I in position 4)
- C must be in position 3 (since it's in the word but not in 1 or 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, B

The only valid word fitting these constraints is MUCID.

   So HUMIC is invalid because C is in position 5, which was marked as wrong position in CUBIC.

Wait, re-examining CUBIC feedback:
C(-) in position 1 and 5 means C is in word but not in 1 or 5. So C must be in position 3.

Thus word must be: _ U C I _

Possible: D U C I K, F U C I D, G U C I D, H U C I D, M U C I D, P U C I D, V U C I D, W U C I D, Y U C I D, Z U C I D.

Allowed consonants: C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,V,W,Y,Z  
Vowels: only U and I used.
