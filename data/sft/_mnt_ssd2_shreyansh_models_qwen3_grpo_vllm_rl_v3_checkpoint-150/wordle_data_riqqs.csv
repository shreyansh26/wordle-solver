For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- It does NOT contain A, O, E.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Avoids R in position 2 and S in position 4.

Good letters to try next are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. The remaining common vowels are I and U. Let’s look for a word with R and S plus I or U, while keeping the constraints.

Possible candidates: RISKY, URINE, STRIP, TRIPS, etc.  
""TRIPS"" looks good: it has R and S, avoids A/O/E, and positions are:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this would be bad)
  
""RISKY"" has R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and uses I/K/Y – all new letters. No A/O/E.  
""URINE"" has S missing.  
""STRIP"" has S in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RISKY"" seems the best so far.

Another option: ""CRISP"" – but has C and P (new), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""DRIPS"" – D, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""FRISK"" – F, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""GRIST"" – G, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""WRIST"" – W, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""PRISK"" – P, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""TRIPS"" – T, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URBIS"" – U, R, B, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URGIS"" – U, R, G, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URSUS"" – has two S’s and U twice, but R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RUSTY"" – has no S.  

""RIFTS"" – R, I, F, T, S. R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). No A/O/E. This looks good.  

Between ""RISKY"" and ""RIFTS"":
- ""RISKY"" has R in 1, S in 3, I in 4, K in 5, Y in 2.

From the new feedback on RIFTS:

- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 4: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 5: S

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, O, E, F, T).

We need to find a word that starts with R, has I in position 2, ends with S, and uses only allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible patterns: R I _ _ S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – not common
- RICHS – not a word
- RIGGS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – not common
- RINSE – has E (invalid)
- RINNS – has N, but ends with S
- RINSE – invalid
- RINNS – valid? RINNS is a Scottish term for narrow lanes, but obscure.
- RIVNS – not a word
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILTS – T is invalid
- RILAS – A is invalid
- RILIS – I is already in position 2
- RIKES – E is invalid
- RILKE – E is invalid
- RILLY – ends with Y, not S
- RIMPS – M, P allowed
- RINPS – not a word
- RINMS – not a word
- RIKES – E invalid
- RIMES – E invalid
- RINSE – E invalid
- RILKS – L, K allowed
- RILKS is a valid word (variant spelling of rilke, a poet)

Another candidate: RINMS – not a word.
RILKS seems the only valid one.

But let me check more systematically:

Valid English words starting with RI and ending with S:
- RIBAS – Spanish surname, not common English
- RICAS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – valid (variant of Rilke)
- RINAS – not common
- RINSE – invalid (E)
- RINNS – obscure
- RIVAS – not common
- RIZS – not 5 letters
- RIKES – invalid (E)
- RIMES – invalid (E)
- RINSE – invalid (E)

RILKS appears to be the only valid word fitting the pattern R I _ _ S with allowed letters (B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Thus, the next guess is RILKS.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, O, E, F, T).

We need to find a word that starts with R, has I in position 2, ends with S, and uses only allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible patterns: R I _ _ S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – not common

- RIGGS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – not common
- RINSE – has E (invalid)
- RINNS – has N, but ends with S

- RINNS – valid? RINNS is a Scottish term for narrow lanes, but obscure.
- RIVNS – not a word
- RIKIS – not a word

Another candidate: RINMS – not a word.
RILKS seems the only valid one.

But let me check more systematically:

Valid English words starting with RI and ending with S:
- RIBAS – Spanish surname, not common English
- RICAS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – valid (variant of Rilke)

- RINNS – obscure
- RIVAS – not common
- RIZS – not 5 letters
- RIKES – invalid (E)
- RIMES – invalid (E)
- RINSE – invalid (E)

RILKS appears to be the only valid word fitting the pattern R I _ _ S with allowed letters (B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- It does NOT contain A, O, E.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Avoids R in position 2 and S in position 4.

Good letters to try next are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. The remaining common vowels are I and U. Let’s look for a word with R and S plus I or U, while keeping the constraints.

Possible candidates: RISKY, URINE, STRIP, TRIPS, etc.  
""TRIPS"" looks good: it has R and S, avoids A/O/E, and positions are:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this would be bad)
  
""RISKY"" has R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and uses I/K/Y – all new letters. No A/O/E.  
""URINE"" has S missing.  
""STRIP"" has S in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RISKY"" seems the best so far.

Another option: ""CRISP"" – but has C and P (new), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""DRIPS"" – D, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""FRISK"" – F, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""GRIST"" – G, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""WRIST"" – W, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""PRISK"" – P, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""TRIPS"" – T, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URBIS"" – U, R, B, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URGIS"" – U, R, G, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URSUS"" – has two S’s and U twice, but R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RUSTY"" – has no S.  

""RIFTS"" – R, I, F, T, S. R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). No A/O/E. This looks good.  

Between ""RISKY"" and ""RIFTS"":
- ""RISKY"" has R in 1, S in 3, I in 4, K in 5, Y in 2.
- ""RIFTS"" has R in 1, I in 2, F in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

""RIFTS"" avoids position conflicts for R and S, and introduces I, F, T.  
Let’s go with ""RIFTS"".

- Position 3: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 4: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 5: S

- RINUS – not a word  
- RIVUS – not a word

Good letters to try next are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. The remaining common vowels are I and U. Let’s look for a word with R and S plus I or U, while keeping the constraints.

Possible candidates: RISKY, URINE, STRIP, TRIPS, etc.  
""TRIPS"" looks good: it has R and S, avoids A/O/E, and positions are:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this would be bad)
  
""RISKY"" has R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and uses I/K/Y – all new letters. No A/O/E.  
""URINE"" has S missing.  
""STRIP"" has S in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RISKY"" seems the best so far.

Another option: ""CRISP"" – but has C and P (new), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""DRIPS"" – D, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""FRISK"" – F, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""GRIST"" – G, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""WRIST"" – W, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""PRISK"" – P, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""TRIPS"" – T, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URBIS"" – U, R, B, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URGIS"" – U, R, G, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URSUS"" – has two S’s and U twice, but R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RUSTY"" – has no S.  

""RIFTS"" – R, I, F, T, S. R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). No A/O/E. This looks good.  

Between ""RISKY"" and ""RIFTS"":
- ""RISKY"" has R in 1, S in 3, I in 4, K in 5, Y in 2.
- ""RIFTS"" has R in 1, I in 2, F in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

""RIFTS"" avoids position conflicts for R and S, and introduces I, F, T.  
Let’s go with ""RIFTS"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RIFTS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) F(x) T(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RIFTS:

- R(✓) – R is in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 4: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 5: S

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, O, E, F, T).

We need to find a word that starts with R, has I in position 2, ends with S, and uses only allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible patterns: R I _ _ S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – not common
- RICHS – not a word
- RIGGS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – not common
- RINSE – has E (invalid)
- RINNS – has N, but ends with S
- RINSE – invalid
- RINNS – valid? RINNS is a Scottish term for narrow lanes, but obscure.
- RIVNS – not a word
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILTS – T is invalid
- RILAS – A is invalid
- RILIS – I is already in position 2
- RIKES – E is invalid
- RILKE – E is invalid
- RILLY – ends with Y, not S
- RIMPS – M, P allowed
- RINPS – not a word
- RINMS – not a word
- RIKES – E invalid
- RIMES – E invalid
- RINSE – E invalid
- RILKS – L, K allowed
- RILKS is a valid word (variant spelling of rilke, a poet)

Another candidate: RINMS – not a word.
RILKS seems the only valid one.

But let me check more systematically:

Valid English words starting with RI and ending with S:
- RIBAS – Spanish surname, not common English
- RICAS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – valid (variant of Rilke)
- RINAS – not common
- RINSE – invalid (E)
- RINNS – obscure
- RIVAS – not common
- RIZS – not 5 letters
- RIKES – invalid (E)
- RIMES – invalid (E)
- RINSE – invalid (E)

RILKS appears to be the only valid word fitting the pattern R I _ _ S with allowed letters (B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Thus, the next guess is RILKS.

Guess 3: RILKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) L(x) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RILKS:

- R(✓) – R is in position 1 (confirmed again).
- I(✓) – I is in position 2 (confirmed again).
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 (confirmed again).

So the pattern is now:
R I _ _ S
with positions 3 and 4 still unknown, but we now know the letters NOT to use in those positions:
Forbidden letters so far: A, O, E, F, T, L, K.

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that starts with RI, ends with S, and uses only allowed letters in the middle two positions.

Let’s list common English words matching R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – not common
- RICHS – not a word
- RIGGS – not common
- RIKIS – invalid (K, I already used)
- RILKS – already tried
- RINSE – contains E (invalid)
- RINNS – obscure
- RIVNS – not a word
- RIZS – not 5 letters
- RIMPS – M, P allowed
- RINPS – not a word
- RINMS – not a word
- RIKES – contains E (invalid)
- RIMES – contains E (invalid)
- RINSE – contains E (invalid)

The only plausible remaining word seems to be RIMPS, but that’s not a standard word.  
Another candidate: RINAS – not common.  
RIGGS – not common.  
RIBBS – not common.  

However, ""RIGGS"" is actually a valid word (a surname or Scottish term for a ridge).  
""RIGGS"" uses G in position 4 and S in 5, but S is already fixed in 5.  

Wait – ""RIGGS"" is R I G G S, but position 5 is already S, so it would be R I G G S – but we need position 4 to be a single letter, and this has G in both 3 and 4.  

Let me think of other possibilities:  
- RINUS – not a word  
- RIVUS – not a word  
- RIMUS – not a word  
- RINAS – not a word  

Another systematic approach: look for 5-letter words starting with RI and ending with S, excluding any of the forbidden letters in positions 3 and 4.

Valid English words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBAS – Spanish surname  
- RICAS – not common  
- RIGGS – valid (Scottish ridge)  
- RIKIS – invalid  
- RINAS – not common  
- RINSE – invalid (E)  
- RINNS – obscure  
- RIVAS – not common  
- RIZS – not 5 letters  

""RIGGS"" appears to be the only common enough word left that fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is RIGGS.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- It does NOT contain A, O, E.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Avoids R in position 2 and S in position 4.

Good letters to try next are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. The remaining common vowels are I and U. Let’s look for a word with R and S plus I or U, while keeping the constraints.

Possible candidates: RISKY, URINE, STRIP, TRIPS, etc.  
""TRIPS"" looks good: it has R and S, avoids A/O/E, and positions are:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this would be bad)
  
""RISKY"" has R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and uses I/K/Y – all new letters. No A/O/E.  
""URINE"" has S missing.  
""STRIP"" has S in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RISKY"" seems the best so far.

Another option: ""CRISP"" – but has C and P (new), R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""DRIPS"" – D, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""FRISK"" – F, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""GRIST"" – G, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""WRIST"" – W, R, I, S, T. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""PRISK"" – P, R, I, S, K. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""TRIPS"" – T, R, I, P, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URBIS"" – U, R, B, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URGIS"" – U, R, G, I, S. R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""URSUS"" – has two S’s and U twice, but R in position 2 (not allowed).  

""RUSTY"" – has no S.  

""RIFTS"" – R, I, F, T, S. R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). No A/O/E. This looks good.  

Between ""RISKY"" and ""RIFTS"":
- ""RISKY"" has R in 1, S in 3, I in 4, K in 5, Y in 2.
- ""RIFTS"" has R in 1, I in 2, F in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

""RIFTS"" avoids position conflicts for R and S, and introduces I, F, T.  
Let’s go with ""RIFTS"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RIFTS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) F(x) T(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RIFTS:

- R(✓) – R is in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 4: unknown (but not F, T, A, O, E)
- Position 5: S

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, O, E, F, T).

We need to find a word that starts with R, has I in position 2, ends with S, and uses only allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible patterns: R I _ _ S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – not common
- RICHS – not a word
- RIGGS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – not common
- RINSE – has E (invalid)
- RINNS – has N, but ends with S
- RINSE – invalid
- RINNS – valid? RINNS is a Scottish term for narrow lanes, but obscure.
- RIVNS – not a word
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILTS – T is invalid
- RILAS – A is invalid
- RILIS – I is already in position 2
- RIKES – E is invalid
- RILKE – E is invalid
- RILLY – ends with Y, not S
- RIMPS – M, P allowed
- RINPS – not a word
- RINMS – not a word
- RIKES – E invalid
- RIMES – E invalid
- RINSE – E invalid
- RILKS – L, K allowed
- RILKS is a valid word (variant spelling of rilke, a poet)

Another candidate: RINMS – not a word.
RILKS seems the only valid one.

But let me check more systematically:

Valid English words starting with RI and ending with S:
- RIBAS – Spanish surname, not common English
- RICAS – not common
- RIKIS – not a word
- RILKS – valid (variant of Rilke)
- RINAS – not common
- RINSE – invalid (E)
- RINNS – obscure
- RIVAS – not common
- RIZS – not 5 letters
- RIKES – invalid (E)
- RIMES – invalid (E)
- RINSE – invalid (E)

RILKS appears to be the only valid word fitting the pattern R I _ _ S with allowed letters (B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Thus, the next guess is RILKS.

Guess 3: RILKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) L(x) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RILKS:

- R(✓) – R is in position 1 (confirmed again).
- I(✓) – I is in position 2 (confirmed again).
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 (confirmed again).

So the pattern is now:
R I _ _ S
with positions 3 and 4 still unknown, but we now know the letters NOT to use in those positions:
Forbidden letters so far: A, O, E, F, T, L, K.

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that starts with RI, ends with S, and uses only allowed letters in the middle two positions.

Let’s list common English words matching R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – not common
- RICHS – not a word
- RIGGS – not common
- RIKIS – invalid (K, I already used)
- RILKS – already tried
- RINSE – contains E (invalid)
- RINNS – obscure
- RIVNS – not a word
- RIZS – not 5 letters
- RIMPS – M, P allowed
- RINPS – not a word
- RINMS – not a word
- RIKES – contains E (invalid)
- RIMES – contains E (invalid)
- RINSE – contains E (invalid)

The only plausible remaining word seems to be RIMPS, but that’s not a standard word.  
Another candidate: RINAS – not common.  
RIGGS – not common.  
RIBBS – not common.  

However, ""RIGGS"" is actually a valid word (a surname or Scottish term for a ridge).  
""RIGGS"" uses G in position 4 and S in 5, but S is already fixed in 5.  

Wait – ""RIGGS"" is R I G G S, but position 5 is already S, so it would be R I G G S – but we need position 4 to be a single letter, and this has G in both 3 and 4.  

Let me think of other possibilities:  
- RINUS – not a word  
- RIVUS – not a word  
- RIMUS – not a word  
- RINAS – not a word  

Another systematic approach: look for 5-letter words starting with RI and ending with S, excluding any of the forbidden letters in positions 3 and 4.

Valid English words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBAS – Spanish surname  
- RICAS – not common  
- RIGGS – valid (Scottish ridge)  
- RIKIS – invalid  
- RINAS – not common  
- RINSE – invalid (E)  
- RINNS – obscure  
- RIVAS – not common  
- RIZS – not 5 letters  

""RIGGS"" appears to be the only common enough word left that fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is RIGGS.

Current known pattern: R I _ _ S  
Forbidden letters in positions 3 and 4 so far: A, O, E, F, T, L, K, G.

Remaining usable letters for positions 3 and 4 (alphabetically): B, C, D, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word starting with RI, ending with S, and using only allowed letters in the middle two positions.

Common English words fitting R I _ _ S:
- RIBBS – B allowed, but “RIBBS” is uncommon.
- RICHS – not a word.
- RINDS – D and N allowed; “RINDS” is valid (plural of rind).
- RINSE – invalid (E).
- RIVNS – not a word.
- RIZS – not 5 letters.
- RIMPS – M and P allowed; “RIMPS” is uncommon.
- RINAS – not common.
- RIVAS – not common.

The clearest valid word left is “RINDS”.

Check letters:
- R(1) ✓, I(2) ✓, N(3) allowed, D(4) allowed, S(5) ✓.
- No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, the next guess is RINDS.
