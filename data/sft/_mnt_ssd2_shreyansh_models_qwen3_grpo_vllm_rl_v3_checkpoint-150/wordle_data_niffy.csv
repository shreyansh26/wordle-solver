### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good coverage for identifying which letters are in the secret word.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

From the new feedback on DINGY:

- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- I(✓) → I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N(-) → N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be elsewhere).
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:

Letters that must appear:
- I in position 2
- Y in position 5
- N somewhere (but not in position 3)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G

Remaining possible letters (excluding the above):
B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I as the second letter
- Y as the fifth letter
- N somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but position 2 is already I, so positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Only using the remaining letters above

Possible patterns: _ I _ _ _ with Y at the end and N somewhere in the first three positions.

Let's think of words fitting this:
- B I N K Y → ""BINKY"" (but we don't know about B, K yet)
- C I N C Y → ""CINCY"" (but C is okay, and Y is correct)
- F I N E Y → but E is excluded
- H I N G Y → but G is excluded
- M I N C Y → ""Mincy"" (but is this a valid word?)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good coverage for identifying which letters are in the secret word.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters, so I need a fresh set of letters that are still frequent in English 5-letter words.  
Good remaining candidates include:  
- T, I, N, L, U  
- C, H, D, M, P  
- B, G, K, Y, F  

A balanced word using several of these is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).

From the feedback so far:

- AROSE → all letters x → A, R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
- UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x) → N and I are in the word but in wrong positions.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Letters that must appear: N and I (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)

Looking for a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both N and I
2. Does not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
3. Places N somewhere other than position 2
4. Places I somewhere other than position 4

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, B, V, W, etc.

2. Letters that must appear:

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that:

  – N I C Y _ → N I C Y (but needs 5 letters)  
  – N I V Y _ → N I V Y (invalid)  
  – N I C K Y → N I C K Y (but K is excluded)

  – _ I _ N Y → M I N C Y (M allowed, word valid)  
  – _ I _ N Y → F I N C Y (F allowed, word valid)

Among these, the simplest valid word that uses only allowed letters and satisfies all constraints is “CINCY” (C I N C Y).

- Pattern: _ I _ N Y → C I N C Y → fits _ I _ N Y
- Contains N in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters C, I, N, C, Y are from the allowed set
- Word is valid English (variant of “cinch” or a recognized brand)

Current constraints:

1. Word pattern: _ I _ _ Y
   - Position 2 = I
   - Position 5 = Y

2. Letters that must appear:
   - N (from earlier “-” feedback) but NOT in positions 3 (from DINGY) or 3/4 (from BINKY).  
     So N must be in position 1 or 4.

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (x so far):
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, B, K

4. Remaining candidate letters (alphabet minus excluded set):
   C, F, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
   - is of the form N I _ _ Y or _ I _ N Y
   - uses only the remaining letters in the blanks
   - contains N exactly once (since we’ve only seen one “N” so far)

Possible patterns:
   N I _ _ Y   or   _ I _ N Y

Let’s list valid English words that fit:

- N I _ _ Y
  – N I C Y _ → N I C Y (but needs 5 letters)  
  – N I V Y _ → N I V Y (invalid)  
  – N I C K Y → N I C K Y (but K is excluded)

- _ I _ N Y
  – _ I _ N Y → H I Z N Y (invalid)  
  – _ I _ N Y → C I N C Y (but C is allowed, and word is valid)  
  – _ I _ N Y → P I N C Y (P allowed, word valid)  
  – _ I _ N Y → M I N C Y (M allowed, word valid)  
  – _ I _ N Y → F I N C Y (F allowed, word valid)

Among these, the simplest valid word that uses only allowed letters and satisfies all constraints is “CINCY” (C I N C Y).  
Let’s check:
- Pattern: _ I _ N Y → C I N C Y → fits _ I _ N Y
- Contains N in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters C, I, N, C, Y are from the allowed set
- Word is valid English (variant of “cinch” or a recognized brand)

Therefore, the next logical guess is CINCY.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Fixed letters:  
   - Position 2 = I  
   - Position 5 = Y  

2. Letter N must appear exactly once and must be in the word, but it cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (it was shown in position 3 by DINGY and in position 3 again by BINKY, both times marked “-”, so it must be elsewhere).  
   Therefore N must be in position 1.

3. Excluded letters so far:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, B, K, C

4. Remaining candidate letters for positions 3 and 4:  
   F, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

5. Word must be of the form N I _ _ Y and use only the allowed letters in the blanks.

Possible 5-letter words fitting N I _ _ Y with allowed letters:
- N I F _ Y → N I F _ Y → N I F T Y (but T is excluded)  
- N I M _ Y → N I M _ Y → N I M B Y (B excluded)  
- N I P _ Y → N I P _ Y → N I P P Y (P allowed, word valid)  
- N I V _ Y → N I V _ Y → N I V Y _ (needs 5 letters)  
- N I H _ Y → N I H _ Y → N I H A Y (A excluded)  

The only valid English word left that fits all constraints is N I P P Y.

Check:
- N I P P Y  
  - Position 1 = N (allowed)  
  - Position 2 = I (fixed)  
  - Position 5 = Y (fixed)  
  - Letters P and P are from the remaining allowed set.  
  - Word is valid and uses no excluded letters.

Therefore, the final logical guess is NIPPY.
