For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters and is a valid word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is not in the word
- T is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but neither is in its original spot.
- The letters L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- Therefore the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. Has S not in position 1 and E not in position 5

Good next-step strategy: choose a word that places S and E in new positions and introduces new common letters (R, I, N, O, C, etc.) while avoiding the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- SHINE (S in 1, E in 5 → violates constraints)
- ROSES (S in 4, E in 5 → violates E in 5)
- SPIRE (S in 1, E in 5 → violates)
- SERFS (S in 1 and 4, E in 2 → violates S in 1)
- INSECTS (too long)
- REINS (S in 5, E in 2 → E is allowed in 2, S in 5 is allowed since original S was in 1)
   - Contains R, I, N which are common
   - Avoids L, A, T
   - S is in position 5 (originally 1, so new position)
   - E is in position 2 (originally 5, so new position)

REINS seems like a strong next guess.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, N  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from SLATE and REINS).  
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  

3. Therefore, the valid positions for each known letter:
   - S: positions 2, 3, or 4  
   - E: positions 1, 3, or 4  
   - N: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5  

4. We still need two more letters (positions 5 or 1/2/3/4 depending on the others) that are not L, A, T, R, I.  
   Common remaining consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

5. A good next word should:
   - Place S, E, N in new, still-allowed positions.  
   - Introduce new common letters to narrow down the remaining slots.  
   - Avoid any of the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- NOSEY (N, O, S, E, Y) – places N in 1, S in 3, E in 4 (all allowed), introduces O and Y.  
- HENGY (but Y is less common, and G is possible)  
- CONES (C, O, N, E, S) – places N in 3, E in 4, S in 5 (but S can't be in 5), so invalid.  
- WOKEN (W, O, K, E, N) – places N in 5, E in 4, introduces O and K.  

""WOKEN"" looks strong:  
- W, O, K are new letters.  
- N is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), S must fit somewhere – but we haven't placed S yet.  
Actually, we need to include S, E, N together.

Better candidate: ""NOSEY""  
- N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (new), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (new).  
All constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""SENOR"" – but R is excluded.  
""SONIC"" – I is excluded.  
""SNOUT"" – T is excluded.  
""SNOWY"" – Y and W are new, N in 1, S in 2 (allowed), O in 3, W in 4, Y in 5.  
This also looks good.

Between ""NOSEY"" and ""SNOWY"", both are valid.  
""SNOWY"" places S in 2 (allowed) and N in 1 (allowed), while ""NOSEY"" places N in 1 and S in 3.  
Both are equally valid, but I'll go with ""NOSEY"" as it introduces O and Y in positions 2 and 5.

- ROSES (S in 4, E in 5 → violates E in 5)
- SPIRE (S in 1, E in 5 → violates)
- SERFS (S in 1 and 4, E in 2 → violates S in 1)
- INSECTS (too long)
- REINS (S in 5, E in 2 → E is allowed in 2, S in 5 is allowed since original S was in 1)
   - Contains R, I, N which are common
   - Avoids L, A, T
   - S is in position 5 (originally 1, so new position)

Let's consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

Guess 1: SLATE  
S(-)  L(x)  A(x)  T(x)  E(-)

Guess 2: REINS  
R(x)  E(-)  I(x)  N(-)  S(-)

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, N  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from SLATE and REINS).  
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  

3. Therefore, the valid positions for each known letter:
   - S: positions 2, 3, or 4  
   - E: positions 1, 3, or 4  
   - N: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5  

4. We still need two more letters (positions 5 or 1/2/3/4 depending on the others) that are not L, A, T, R, I.  
   Common remaining consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

5. A good next word should:
   - Place S, E, N in new, still-allowed positions.  
   - Introduce new common letters to narrow down the remaining slots.  
   - Avoid any of the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- NOSEY (N, O, S, E, Y) – places N in 1, S in 3, E in 4 (all allowed), introduces O and Y.  
- HENGY (but Y is less common, and G is possible)  
- CONES (C, O, N, E, S) – places N in 3, E in 4, S in 5 (but S can't be in 5), so invalid.  
- WOKEN (W, O, K, E, N) – places N in 5, E in 4, introduces O and K.  

""WOKEN"" looks strong:  
- W, O, K are new letters.  
- N is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), S must fit somewhere – but we haven't placed S yet.  
Actually, we need to include S, E, N together.

Better candidate: ""NOSEY""  
- N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (new), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (new).  
All constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""SENOR"" – but R is excluded.  
""SONIC"" – I is excluded.  
""SNOUT"" – T is excluded.  
""SNOWY"" – Y and W are new, N in 1, S in 2 (allowed), O in 3, W in 4, Y in 5.  
This also looks good.

Between ""NOSEY"" and ""SNOWY"", both are valid.  
""SNOWY"" places S in 2 (allowed) and N in 1 (allowed), while ""NOSEY"" places N in 1 and S in 3.  
Both are equally valid, but I'll go with ""NOSEY"" as it introduces O and Y in positions 2 and 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters and is a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is not in the word
- T is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but neither is in its original spot.
- The letters L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- Therefore the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. Has S not in position 1 and E not in position 5

Good next-step strategy: choose a word that places S and E in new positions and introduces new common letters (R, I, N, O, C, etc.) while avoiding the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- SHINE (S in 1, E in 5 → violates constraints)
- ROSES (S in 4, E in 5 → violates E in 5)
- SPIRE (S in 1, E in 5 → violates)
- SERFS (S in 1 and 4, E in 2 → violates S in 1)
- INSECTS (too long)
- REINS (S in 5, E in 2 → E is allowed in 2, S in 5 is allowed since original S was in 1)
   - Contains R, I, N which are common
   - Avoids L, A, T
   - S is in position 5 (originally 1, so new position)

   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  

3. Therefore, the valid positions for each known letter:
   - S: positions 2, 3, or 4  
   - E: positions 1, 3, or 4  
   - N: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5  

4. We still need two more letters (positions 5 or 1/2/3/4 depending on the others) that are not L, A, T, R, I.  
   Common remaining consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

5. A good next word should:
   - Place S, E, N in new, still-allowed positions.  
   - Introduce new common letters to narrow down the remaining slots.  
   - Avoid any of the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- NOSEY (N, O, S, E, Y) – places N in 1, S in 3, E in 4 (all allowed), introduces O and Y.

Better candidate: ""NOSEY""

All constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""SENOR"" – but R is excluded.  
""SONIC"" – I is excluded.  
""SNOUT"" – T is excluded.  
""SNOWY"" – Y and W are new, N in 1, S in 2 (allowed), O in 3, W in 4, Y in 5.

Between ""NOSEY"" and ""SNOWY"", both are valid.  
""SNOWY"" places S in 2 (allowed) and N in 1 (allowed), while ""NOSEY"" places N in 1 and S in 3.

From Guess 4 (WOSEN) we now know:

W(x)  O(✓)  S(✓)  E(✓)  N(✓)

This tells us:
- The word is exactly _ O S E N (positions 2-5 are locked in).
- W is not in the word (and therefore cannot be in position 1).
- We still need a single letter for position 1 that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out across all guesses:
L, A, T, R, I, Y, W

Letters already confirmed in the word: O, S, E, N

So the only unknown is position 1. Any valid starting letter must not be in the excluded list above and must form a real 5-letter English word ending in OSE_N.

Common consonants not yet tried for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Z  
Among these, the most common first letters that combine with “OSE_N” to make real words are:

- B → BOSEN? Not a valid English word.
- C → COSEN? Not valid.
- D → DOSEN? Not valid.
- F → FOSEN? Not valid.
- G → GOSEN? Not valid.
- H → HOSEN? Not valid.
- K → KOSEN? Not valid.
- M → MOSEN? Not valid.
- P → POSEN? Not valid.
- V → VOSEN? Not valid.
- Z → ZOSER? Doesn’t fit.

However, one real word fits the pattern: “POSEN” is not valid, but “HOSER” is invalid due to R. Wait, let’s double-check.

Actually, the only valid English word that matches _ O S E N is:

- “HOSEN” – but H is allowed and not yet excluded, and it’s a valid word (though rare).  
- “MOSEN” – not a word.  
- “POSEN” – not standard.  
- “GOSEN” – not a word.  
- “COSEN” – not a word.  
- “BOSEN” – not a word.  
- “DOSEN” – not a word.  
- “KOSEN” – not a word.  
- “VOSEN” – not a word.  
- “ZOSEN” – not a word.  

But “HOSEN” is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic or dialectal term for “hose” (pipe). However, it’s uncommon.

Another valid word is “HOSEN” or more commonly “HOSER” (but R is excluded). 

Wait, let’s re-examine: we have _ O S E N. The only common English word ending in “OSEN” is “HOSEN” (as above) or “POSEN” (not standard). 

But let’s check if we missed any letters. The letter “D” is still allowed. “DOSEN” is not a word. 

Upon reflection, the correct and only common word fitting _ O S E N is “HOSEN”. Since H has not been excluded, this must be the word.

Therefore, the final guess is:
