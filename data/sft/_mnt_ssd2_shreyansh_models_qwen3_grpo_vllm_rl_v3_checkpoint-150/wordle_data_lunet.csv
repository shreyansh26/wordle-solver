For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, A
- Letters definitely in the word: L, T, E
- Positions to avoid for L, T, E: position 2 (L), position 4 (T), position 5 (E).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, T, E (but not in their previous positions).
2. Does NOT contain S or A.
3. Uses new letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for L, T, E:
- L cannot be in position 2, so possible positions: 1,3,4,5
- T cannot be in position 4, so possible positions: 1,2,3,5
- E cannot be in position 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4

A good next guess would be a word that re-uses L, T, E in new positions and introduces new common letters. Let's try ""TREND"":
- T is moved to position 1 (allowed).
- R is a new common letter.
- E is moved to position 3 (allowed).
- N is a new common letter.
- D is a new common letter.

This gives us three new letters (R, N, D) to test while placing L somewhere else (but we didn't include L here, which is bad). Let me rethink.

Instead, let's include L in a new position. A better word might be ""ELITE"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (but L was in position 2 in SLATE and got ""-"", so this is invalid).

Next option: ""BLEET"" - but this has E in position 5 which is invalid.

Better: ""LETTER"" - but this is 6 letters.

Good 5-letter word: ""LITER""
- L is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is a new letter.
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

- Letters definitely in the word: L, T, E
- Positions to avoid for L, T, E: position 2 (L), position 4 (T), position 5 (E).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, T, E (but not in their previous positions).
2. Does NOT contain S or A.
3. Uses new letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for L, T, E:
- L cannot be in position 2, so possible positions: 1,3,4,5
- T cannot be in position 4, so possible positions: 1,2,3,5
- E cannot be in position 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4

A good next guess would be a word that re-uses L, T, E in new positions and introduces new common letters. Let's try ""TREND"":
- T is moved to position 1 (allowed).
- R is a new common letter.
- E is moved to position 3 (allowed).
- N is a new common letter.
- D is a new common letter.

This gives us three new letters (R, N, D) to test while placing L somewhere else (but we didn't include L here, which is bad). Let me rethink.

Instead, let's include L in a new position. A better word might be ""ELITE"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (but L was in position 2 in SLATE and got ""-"", so this is invalid).

Next option: ""BLEET"" - but this has E in position 5 which is invalid.

Better: ""LETTER"" - but this is 6 letters.

Good 5-letter word: ""LITER""
- L is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is a new letter.
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is a new letter.

This uses L, T, E in new positions and introduces I and R.

Current known facts:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, I, R
- Letters in the word and their positions:
  – L is in position 1 (✓)
  – E is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters in the word but wrong positions:
  – T is in the word but not in position 3 (from LITER) and not in position 4 (from SLATE), so T must be in position 2 or 5.
  – E is already in position 4, so no other E exists.

Word skeleton so far: L _ _ E _

Possible T positions: 2 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 2 → L T _ E _
Case 2: T in position 5 → L _ _ E T

We need two more letters (not S, A, I, R) to fill the remaining spots. Common unused letters: N, D, C, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try Case 1 first: L T _ E _
We need two letters for positions 3 and 5. Good candidates: N, D, C, O, U.

A common word fitting this is L T N E D → “LTEND” (invalid, not a word)
Another: L T O E N → “LTOEN” (invalid)
How about L T U E D → “LTUED” (invalid)

Case 2: L _ _ E T
Need letters for positions 2 and 3. Good candidates: N, D, C, O, U.

Possible word: L O N E T → “LONET” (invalid)
L U N E T → “LUNET” (invalid)
L U C E T → “LUCET” (valid word, means a small boat or to lull)

Let’s go with LUCET.

From the feedback so far we have:

1. L ✓ (position 1)
2. U ✓ (position 2)
3. C x (not in word)
4. E ✓ (position 4)
5. T ✓ (position 5)

So the word pattern is: L U _ E T

Only position 3 is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: S, A, I, R, C  
Letters already confirmed: L, U, E, T  

We need a single letter for position 3 that hasn’t been used yet and keeps the word valid.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting L U _ E T:
- L U B E T  
- L U D E T  
- L U F E T  
- L U G E T  
- L U H E T  
- L U K E T  
- L U M E T  
- L U N E T  
- L U P E T  
- L U V E T  
- L U W E T  
- L U Y E T  

The only valid English word among these is L U N E T (a Scottish word for a narrow lane), but it’s obscure.  
Another check: L U D E T – not valid.  
L U B E T – not valid.  

However, “L U N E T” is listed in some dictionaries as a valid word, so we’ll try it.

Alternative: If “LUNET” isn’t accepted, the next best is “LUGET” (a variant spelling of “louquet”), but that’s also rare.  

Given the constraints, “LUNET” seems the only plausible option.
