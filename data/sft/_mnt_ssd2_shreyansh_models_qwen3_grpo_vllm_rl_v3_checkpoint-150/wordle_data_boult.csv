For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word at all (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and T, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, A, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L and T
2. Does NOT contain S, A, E
3. Has L not in position 2
4. Has T not in position 4

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, G, B, M, P, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Possible structure: Since we have two consonants (L, T), we need three more letters. Let's try to include I and O as remaining vowels.

A good candidate is ""TRIOL"":
- T: in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position is ok)
- R: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- O: new vowel
- L: in position 5 (was in position 2 before, so new position is ok)

But ""TRIOL"" might not be a common word. Let's think of a more common word.

Another candidate: ""TULIP""
- T: position 1 (ok, was position 4)
- U: vowel
- L: position 3 (was position 2, ok)
- I: vowel
- P: new consonant

This seems better as it's a common word and covers U and I as vowels.

But wait, we have to ensure T is not in position 4, which is already satisfied here. Also, no S, A, E.

However, ""TULIP"" has T in position 1, which is fine. But maybe we can do better with more common letters.

Alternative: ""CLOTH""
- C: new consonant
- L: position 2 (was position 2 before, which is same position - but feedback said L is in word but wrong position, so position 2 was wrong, so we must move L)
- O: vowel
- T: position 4 (was position 4 before - same position, but feedback said T is in word but wrong position, so position 4 is wrong, must move T)
- H: new consonant

This is bad because L and T would be in same positions as before, which were marked wrong.

Better: ""FLINT""
- F: new consonant
- L: position 2 (was position 2, same - bad)
- I: vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: position 5 (was position 4, ok)

But L in position 2 was marked wrong, so we must avoid that.

Next: ""BLITZ""
- B: new consonant
- L: position 2 (bad, same as before)
- I: vowel
- T: position 4 (bad, same as before)
- Z: new consonant

Not good.

Alternative: ""PRINT""
- P: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- I: vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: position 5 (was position 4, ok)

This seems good:
- Contains T (position 5, not 4)
- Contains L? No, but we must include L somewhere. So this is bad.

We must include L and T. So let's try ""LITRE"":
- L: position 1 (was position 2, ok)
- I: vowel
- T: position 3 (was position 4, ok)
- R: new consonant
- E: but E was marked x, so can't use E.

""LITRE"" has E - bad.

""LIQUID"" is 6 letters - no.

""LIGHT"":
- L: position 1 (ok)
- I: vowel
- G: new consonant
- H: new consonant
- T: position 5 (ok)
- No S, A, E.

This seems perfect:
- Contains L (position 1, was position 2)
- Contains T (position 5, was position 4)
- No S, A, E
- Uses new consonants G and H
- Uses vowel I

""LIGHT"" is a common word and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word at all (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and T, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, A, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L and T
2. Does NOT contain S, A, E
3. Has L not in position 2
4. Has T not in position 4

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, G, B, M, P, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Possible structure: Since we have two consonants (L, T), we need three more letters. Let's try to include I and O as remaining vowels.

A good candidate is ""TRIOL"":
- T: in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position is ok)
- R: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- O: new vowel
- L: in position 5 (was in position 2 before, so new position is ok)

But ""TRIOL"" might not be a common word. Let's think of a more common word.

Another candidate: ""TULIP""
- T: position 1 (ok, was position 4)
- U: vowel
- L: position 3 (was position 2, ok)
- I: vowel
- P: new consonant

This seems better as it's a common word and covers U and I as vowels.

But wait, we have to ensure T is not in position 4, which is already satisfied here. Also, no S, A, E.

However, ""TULIP"" has T in position 1, which is fine. But maybe we can do better with more common letters.

Alternative: ""CLOTH""
- C: new consonant
- L: position 2 (was position 2 before, which is same position - but feedback said L is in word but wrong position, so position 2 was wrong, so we must move L)
- O: vowel
- T: position 4 (was position 4 before - same position, but feedback said T is in word but wrong position, so position 4 is wrong, must move T)
- H: new consonant

This is bad because L and T would be in same positions as before, which were marked wrong.

Better: ""FLINT""
- F: new consonant
- L: position 2 (was position 2, same - bad)
- I: vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: position 5 (was position 4, ok)

But L in position 2 was marked wrong, so we must avoid that.

Next: ""BLITZ""
- B: new consonant
- L: position 2 (bad, same as before)
- I: vowel
- T: position 4 (bad, same as before)
- Z: new consonant

Not good.

Alternative: ""PRINT""
- P: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- I: vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: position 5 (was position 4, ok)

This seems good:
- Contains T (position 5, not 4)
- Contains L? No, but we must include L somewhere. So this is bad.

We must include L and T. So let's try ""LITRE"":
- L: position 1 (was position 2, ok)
- I: vowel
- T: position 3 (was position 4, ok)
- R: new consonant
- E: but E was marked x, so can't use E.

""LITRE"" has E - bad.

""LIQUID"" is 6 letters - no.

""LIGHT"":
- L: position 1 (ok)
- I: vowel
- G: new consonant
- H: new consonant
- T: position 5 (ok)
- No S, A, E.

This seems perfect:
- Contains L (position 1, was position 2)
- Contains T (position 5, was position 4)
- No S, A, E
- Uses new consonants G and H
- Uses vowel I

""LIGHT"" is a common word and fits all constraints.

   - U is correct in position 3: B _ U _ T
   - L is in the word but not in position 2

So the word structure is now:

Let's consider both possibilities:

1. B L U _ T:
   - Position 4 must be a consonant (since T is at 5). Possible letters: C, D, F, K, M, P, R
   - Looking for valid 5-letter words: BLUNT is already tried (N is out), BLURT (not a word), BLUDT (not a word), BLUMT (not a word), BLURT (not a word), BLIF... etc. Not finding common words here.

2. B _ U L T:
   - Position 2 must be a consonant. Possible letters: C, D, F, K, M, P, R
   - Looking for valid 5-letter words:
     - B C U L T (not a word)
     - B D U L T (not a word)
     - B F U L T (not a word)
     - B K U L T (not a word)
     - B M U L T (not a word)
     - B P U L T (not a word)
     - B R U L T (not a word)
     - B L U L T (invalid, L already used)
     - B O U L T (O is a vowel, but is ""B O U L T"" a word? ""Boult"" is not standard)
     - B U is already in position 3

Wait, let's think differently - maybe position 2 is a vowel, but the only remaining vowel is O (since U is used, A, E, I are out).

So possible word: B O U L T - but ""Boult"" is not a standard English word.

Another approach: maybe position 2 is a consonant and position 4 is a vowel, but U is already used in position 3.

Actually, from the structure B _ U _ T, the remaining letters must be consonants for positions 2 and 4, but position 4 is already T (position 5), so position 4 is the last letter before T.

Wait, the structure is:
Position 1: B
Position 2: ?
Position 3: U
Position 4: ?
Position 5: T

And L must be in either position 2 or 4.

Also, from BLUNT feedback, L is in the word but not in position 2, so L must be in position 4.

Thus the structure is: B _ U L T

Now we need a consonant for position 2. Possible letters: C, D, F, K, M, P, R

Looking for valid words:
- B C U L T → ""BCULT"" - not a word
- B D U L T → ""BDULT"" - not a word
- B F U L T → ""BFULT"" - not a word
- B K U L T → ""BKULT"" - not a word
- B M U L T → ""BMULT"" - not a word
- B P U L T → ""BPULT"" - not a word
- B R U L T → ""BRULT"" - not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think of actual words that fit B _ U L T:
- ""Boult"" - not standard
- ""Bault"" - not standard
- ""Bzult"" - not possible

Actually, let me check if ""Boult"" is a valid word. It's a surname but not standard dictionary.

Alternative: maybe position 2 is a vowel O, making the word B O U L T - but this is not a standard word.

Looking back at the constraints, maybe the word is ""BOULT"" but it's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming L must be in position 4. Let me re-examine:

From BLUNT:
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (feedback ""-"")
- So L could be in position 3, 4, or 5
But position 3 is U, position 5 is T, so L must be in position 4.

Thus the structure is indeed B _ U L T

But no common word seems to fit. Maybe ""Boult"" is acceptable as a surname, but in Wordle-like games, it's rare.

Wait, let me think of other consonants for position 2. Maybe ""C"" gives ""BCULT"" - no.

Actually, the only valid word I can think of fitting this is ""Boult"", but it's not standard.

Perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the word is ""BUILT"":
- B(✓) U(✓) I(?) L(?) T(✓)
But I was marked x in LIGHT, so I is not in the word.

""BUILT"" has I which is forbidden.

""BULT"" is 4 letters.

""BUILT"" is invalid.

""BLOUT"" was considered but O and U are allowed, but L is in position 2 which was marked ""-"" in BLUNT (meaning L is not in position 2), so ""BLOUT"" is invalid as L is in position 2.

Thus the only possible structure left is B _ U L T with L in position 4.

But no common word seems to fit. This suggests I might have missed a possibility.

Wait, let me think of ""Boult"" as a valid word. It's listed in some dictionaries as a surname, but not common.

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""Boult"" and it's acceptable.

But to be sure, let me think of other possibilities.

Another approach: maybe position 2 is a consonant and position 4 is a consonant, but L must be in one of them.

Actually, from BLUNT:
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (so possible positions 3,4,5)
- But position 3 is U, position 5 is T, so L must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be B _ U L T.

Looking up valid English words, the only one that fits is ""Boult"" (as in the surname), but it's not standard.

However, in Wordle word lists, ""Boult"" is actually accepted.

Thus, the next guess is ""Boult"".

But to be precise, the word should be ""B O U L T"".

But in the game, we need to input it as a single word, so ""Boult"" is correct.

But let me check if there's another word. Actually, ""Boult"" is the only one.

Thus, the guess is ""Boult"".

From the feedback:
- Word starts with B and ends with T: B _ _ _ T
- U is in position 3: B _ U _ T
- L is in the word but not in position 2, so must be in position 4: B _ U L T
- Forbidden letters: S, A, E, I, G, H, N

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is ""Boult"".

<guess>Boult</guess>",Boult,"From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, A, E
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: L, T

2. LIGHT → L(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(✓)
   - Additional letters NOT in the word: I, G, H
   - T is confirmed in position 5: _ _ _ _ T
   - L is still in the word but not in position 1

3. BLUNT → B(✓) L(-) U(✓) N(x) T(✓)
   - B is correct in position 1: B _ _ _ T
   - T is confirmed in position 5 (already known)
   - U is correct in position 3: B _ U _ T
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - N is not in the word

So the word structure is now:
B _ U _ T
with L somewhere in position 2 or 4.

Possible positions for L:
- Position 2: B L U _ T
- Position 4: B _ U L T

Letters already used and confirmed:
B, U, T, L

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, A, E, I, G, H, N

Remaining possible letters for the blank positions (positions 2 and 4):
Common consonants: C, D, F, K, M, P, R, etc.
Common vowels: O (since U is already used, and A, E, I are forbidden)

     - B O U L T (O is a vowel, but is ""B O U L T"" a word? ""Boult"" is not standard)
     - B U is already in position 3

Wait, let's think differently - maybe position 2 is a vowel, but the only remaining vowel is O (since U is used, A, E, I are out).

So possible word: B O U L T - but ""Boult"" is not a standard English word.
