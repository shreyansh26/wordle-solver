For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that are among the most common. 

Some good starting words include:
- ARISE
- RAISE
- STARE
- AROSE
- SLATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STORM → S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

What we know so far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, I, E, T, O, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed: R, S

So the secret word contains both R and S, and neither is in any of the positions we’ve tried so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ARISE) or position 4 (from STORM).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from ARISE) or position 1 (from STORM).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, I, E, T, O, M.
3. Places R and S in positions we haven’t ruled out.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses R and S plus three of these remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.

Candidate word: “CRUSH”
- Contains C, R, U, S, H.
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of positions 2 and 4 in previous guesses? Wait, no: in STORM, R was in position 4 and got “-”, so R is ruled out of position 4, but position 2 was ruled out in ARISE. So R cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S was ruled out of positions 1 and 4).
- C, U, H are new letters not yet tested.

But let’s check positions more carefully:
- R cannot be in position 2 (ARISE) or position 4 (STORM).
- S cannot be in position 1 (STORM) or position 4 (ARISE).

So possible positions:
- R: positions 1, 3, 5
- S: positions 2, 3, 5

Let’s try a word like “SPURN”:
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Next try “URNS” plus another letter? Need 5 letters.

Let’s try “URNS” plus a consonant: “URNSD” – not a word.

Let’s try “SCRUB”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Let’s try “DRYS” plus a letter: “DRYSA” – invalid.

Let’s try “BURPS”:
- B, U, R, P, S.
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- B, U, P are new letters not yet ruled out.

“BURPS” seems valid:
- Contains R and S.
- R in position 3 (not ruled out).
- S in position 5 (not ruled out).
- Letters B, U, P are new and not in the forbidden list.

So I’ll go with BURPS.

- R is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of positions 2 and 4 in previous guesses? Wait, no: in STORM, R was in position 4 and got “-”, so R is ruled out of position 4, but position 2 was ruled out in ARISE. So R cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S was ruled out of positions 1 and 4).
- C, U, H are new letters not yet tested.

But let’s check positions more carefully:
- R cannot be in position 2 (ARISE) or position 4 (STORM).
- S cannot be in position 1 (STORM) or position 4 (ARISE).

So possible positions:
- R: positions 1, 3, 5
- S: positions 2, 3, 5

Let’s try a word like “SPURN”:
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Next try “URNS” plus another letter? Need 5 letters.

Let’s try “URNS” plus a consonant: “URNSD” – not a word.

Let’s try “SCRUB”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Let’s try “DRYS” plus a letter: “DRYSA” – invalid.

Let’s try “BURPS”:
- B, U, R, P, S.
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- B, U, P are new letters not yet ruled out.

“BURPS” seems valid:
- Contains R and S.
- R in position 3 (not ruled out).
- S in position 5 (not ruled out).
- Letters B, U, P are new and not in the forbidden list.

So I’ll go with BURPS.

From the feedback so far:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that are among the most common. 

Some good starting words include:
- ARISE
- RAISE
- STARE
- AROSE
- SLATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, I, or E

Letters we still need to place: R and S, plus three more letters that are not A, I, or E.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Common remaining vowels: O, U, Y (since A and I are out)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R and S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid A, I, E

Possible candidates:
- STORM (but O is common, T and M are good)
- SNORT (but N and T are good, but O is in position 3)
- TORSO (but O is repeated, and we don't know about O yet)
- DROSS (but S is repeated, and we don't know about D or O)

I'll go with STORM:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4)
- T, O, M are new common letters
- Avoids A, I, E

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STORM → S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

What we know so far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, I, E, T, O, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed: R, S

So the secret word contains both R and S, and neither is in any of the positions we’ve tried so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ARISE) or position 4 (from STORM).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from ARISE) or position 1 (from STORM).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, I, E, T, O, M.
3. Places R and S in positions we haven’t ruled out.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses R and S plus three of these remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.

Candidate word: “CRUSH”
- Contains C, R, U, S, H.
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of positions 2 and 4 in previous guesses? Wait, no: in STORM, R was in position 4 and got “-”, so R is ruled out of position 4, but position 2 was ruled out in ARISE. So R cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S was ruled out of positions 1 and 4).
- C, U, H are new letters not yet tested.

But let’s check positions more carefully:
- R cannot be in position 2 (ARISE) or position 4 (STORM).
- S cannot be in position 1 (STORM) or position 4 (ARISE).

So possible positions:
- R: positions 1, 3, 5
- S: positions 2, 3, 5

Let’s try a word like “SPURN”:
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Next try “URNS” plus another letter? Need 5 letters.

Let’s try “URNS” plus a consonant: “URNSD” – not a word.

Let’s try “SCRUB”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Let’s try “DRYS” plus a letter: “DRYSA” – invalid.

Let’s try “BURPS”:
- B, U, R, P, S.
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- B, U, P are new letters not yet ruled out.

“BURPS” seems valid:
- Contains R and S.
- R in position 3 (not ruled out).
- S in position 5 (not ruled out).
- Letters B, U, P are new and not in the forbidden list.

So I’ll go with BURPS.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that are among the most common. 

Some good starting words include:
- ARISE
- RAISE
- STARE
- AROSE
- SLATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, I, or E

Letters we still need to place: R and S, plus three more letters that are not A, I, or E.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Common remaining vowels: O, U, Y (since A and I are out)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R and S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid A, I, E

Possible candidates:
- STORM (but O is common, T and M are good)
- SNORT (but N and T are good, but O is in position 3)
- TORSO (but O is repeated, and we don't know about O yet)
- DROSS (but S is repeated, and we don't know about D or O)

I'll go with STORM:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4)
- T, O, M are new common letters
- Avoids A, I, E

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STORM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STORM → S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

What we know so far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, I, E, T, O, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed: R, S

So the secret word contains both R and S, and neither is in any of the positions we’ve tried so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ARISE) or position 4 (from STORM).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from ARISE) or position 1 (from STORM).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, I, E, T, O, M.
3. Places R and S in positions we haven’t ruled out.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses R and S plus three of these remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.

Candidate word: “CRUSH”
- Contains C, R, U, S, H.
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of positions 2 and 4 in previous guesses? Wait, no: in STORM, R was in position 4 and got “-”, so R is ruled out of position 4, but position 2 was ruled out in ARISE. So R cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S was ruled out of positions 1 and 4).
- C, U, H are new letters not yet tested.

But let’s check positions more carefully:
- R cannot be in position 2 (ARISE) or position 4 (STORM).
- S cannot be in position 1 (STORM) or position 4 (ARISE).

So possible positions:
- R: positions 1, 3, 5
- S: positions 2, 3, 5

Let’s try a word like “SPURN”:
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Next try “URNS” plus another letter? Need 5 letters.

Let’s try “URNS” plus a consonant: “URNSD” – not a word.

Let’s try “SCRUB”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Let’s try “DRYS” plus a letter: “DRYSA” – invalid.

Let’s try “BURPS”:
- B, U, R, P, S.
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- B, U, P are new letters not yet ruled out.

“BURPS” seems valid:
- Contains R and S.
- R in position 3 (not ruled out).
- S in position 5 (not ruled out).
- Letters B, U, P are new and not in the forbidden list.

So I’ll go with BURPS.

Guess 3: BURPS -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – R is in the word, not in position 2.  
   – S is in the word, not in position 4.

2. STORM → S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)  
   – S is in the word, not in position 1.  
   – R is in the word, not in position 4.  
   – T, O, M are not in the word.

3. BURPS → B(✓) U(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(✓)  
   – B is in position 1 and correct.  
   – U is in position 2 and correct.  
   – R is in position 3 and correct.  
   – S is in position 5 and correct.  
   – P is not in the word.

So the secret word is now fully determined: B U R _ S, with the fourth letter still unknown.

Letters already ruled out (from all feedback): A, I, E, T, O, M, P.

Remaining common consonants for the fourth position: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter English words that fit B U R _ S:
- BURKS  
- BURDS  
- BURGS  
- BURYS  
- BURNS  
- BURCS (not a word)  
- BURFS (not a word)

The most common and valid word is BURKS.

Let’s verify:
- B, U, R, K, S – none of these letters are ruled out.  
- K has not been tested yet, so it’s allowed.

Therefore, the next guess should be BURKS.
