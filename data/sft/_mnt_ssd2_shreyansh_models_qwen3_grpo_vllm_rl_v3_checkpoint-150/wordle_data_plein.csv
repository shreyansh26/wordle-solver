For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives us good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

- Contains the letter E, but not in the last spot.

1. Includes E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

Possible structure: _ _ _ E _ or _ _ E _ _ or _ E _ _ _ etc.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in position 4 (not last).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives us good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the last spot.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

Possible structure: _ _ _ E _ or _ _ E _ _ or _ E _ _ _ etc.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in position 4 (not last).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I which haven't been tested yet.

Another option is ""ELITE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid.
""INLET"" is also good but has S (invalid).
""UNTIE"" seems optimal here.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before).

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T.
- Letters in the word: E (not position 5), N (not position 2), I (position 4).
- Word structure so far: _ _ _ I _
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 4.
- E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but 4 is already I, so 1, 2, or 3).
- N somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 4 is I, so 1, 3, or 5).
- No A, R, O, S, U, T.

Possible candidates:
- ""BEGIN"" – but E is in position 3, N in position 5, I in position 4. This fits: B E G I N.
- ""CHINE"" – but E is in position 5, which is invalid.
- ""FLING"" – E not present.
- ""LINED"" – E in position 3, N in position 2 (invalid, N cannot be in position 2).
- ""MIDGE"" – E in position 5 (invalid).
- ""WINED"" – E in position 5 (invalid).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives us good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the last spot.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

Possible structure: _ _ _ E _ or _ _ E _ _ or _ E _ _ _ etc.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in position 4 (not last).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I which haven't been tested yet.

Another option is ""ELITE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid.
""INLET"" is also good but has S (invalid).
""UNTIE"" seems optimal here.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
   - U and T are not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before).

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T.
- Letters in the word: E (not position 5), N (not position 2), I (position 4).
- Word structure so far: _ _ _ I _
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 4.
- E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but 4 is already I, so 1, 2, or 3).
- N somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 4 is I, so 1, 3, or 5).
- No A, R, O, S, U, T.

Possible candidates:
- ""BEGIN"" – but E is in position 3, N in position 5, I in position 4. This fits: B E G I N.
- ""CHINE"" – but E is in position 5, which is invalid.
- ""FLING"" – E not present.
- ""LINED"" – E in position 3, N in position 2 (invalid, N cannot be in position 2).
- ""MIDGE"" – E in position 5 (invalid).
- ""WINED"" – E in position 5 (invalid).

""BEGIN"" seems to fit all constraints:
- I is in position 4 (✓).
- E is in position 3 (not position 5, ✓).
- N is in position 5 (not position 2, ✓).
- No A, R, O, S, U, T.

   – B, G are not in the word.  
   – E is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in position 4 (✓).  
   – N is in position 5 (✓).

Consolidated facts:
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, B, G.
- Letters known TO be in the word: E (positions 1, 3 allowed), I (position 4), N (position 5).
- Word structure: _ _ _ I N  (because N is confirmed in position 5).

We still need to place E somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (position 2 is now also ruled out because BEGIN showed E is not in position 2).

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Candidate words fitting _ _ _ I N:
- C L E I N  → CLEIN (but “CLEIN” is not a valid English word).
- C H E I N  → CHEIN (not valid).
- F L E I N  → FLIEN (not valid).
- H E L I N  → HELIN (not valid).
- M E L I N  → MELIN (valid variant, but less common).
- P E L I N  → PELIN (not valid).
- F E L I N  → FELIN (valid, but rare).
- L E M I N  → LEMIN (not valid).
- D E N I N  → DENIN (not valid).
- F E N I N  → FENIN (not valid).
- C E N I N  → CENIN (not valid).
- L E N I N  → LENIN (valid, but politically sensitive).

Actually, the only common English word fitting _ _ _ I N with E in position 1 or 3 is:

- F L I N E  → FLINE (not valid).
- C H I N E  → CHINE (valid, but rare).
- P I N E  → too short.
- W H I N E  → WHINE (valid and common).

Let’s check WHINE:

- I is in position 4 (✓).  
- N is in position 5 (✓).  
- E is in position 3 (✓, not ruled out).
