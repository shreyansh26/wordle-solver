For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is not in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E do not appear anywhere in the word.

To make the next guess, we want:
- A word that still includes A (but not in position 3).
- A word that avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
- A word that introduces several new, common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, M, C, D, P, H, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U. Since A is already confirmed, we might consider words like:
- CRANE (but E is excluded)
- CHAIN (but I and N are good)
- RADIO (but O and I are good)
- PIANO (but O is good)

Looking at common patterns, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- C, R, N are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed).
- E is excluded, but let's try ""CRANK"" instead which has A in position 2 and avoids E/S/L/T.

Actually, let's pick ""CHARD"":
- C, H, R, D are new common letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- No S, L, T, E.

But ""CHARD"" might be less common. Let's go with ""CRANE"" minus the E: ""CRAN_"". The most common ending would be ""CRANK"" but that's 5 letters. Actually, ""CRANK"" is valid and fits all criteria.

Wait, ""CRANK"" has A in position 2 (not 3) and no S/L/T/E. Perfect.

But let me think of a more common word: ""CHAIR"" has A in position 2, but I is also in the word. Maybe better to test more consonants. 

Another good option is ""PRAIN"" (but not a common word). 

Let's stick with ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A in position 2.
- No S, L, T, E.

This seems optimal.

   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms guess 1).
   - R, N, K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in position 3) and C (not in position 1).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and C.
- Does not contain S, L, T, E, R, N, K.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places C somewhere other than position 1.

Remaining common letters to try: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

- COBIA (but B and I are allowed, but C is in position 1 which is invalid.)

""PACED"" is invalid because of E.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, M, C, D, P, H, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U. Since A is already confirmed, we might consider words like:
- CRANE (but E is excluded)
- CHAIN (but I and N are good)
- RADIO (but O and I are good)
- PIANO (but O is good)

Looking at common patterns, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- C, R, N are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed).
- E is excluded, but let's try ""CRANK"" instead which has A in position 2 and avoids E/S/L/T.

Actually, let's pick ""CHARD"":
- C, H, R, D are new common letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- No S, L, T, E.

But ""CHARD"" might be less common. Let's go with ""CRANE"" minus the E: ""CRAN_"". The most common ending would be ""CRANK"" but that's 5 letters. Actually, ""CRANK"" is valid and fits all criteria.

Wait, ""CRANK"" has A in position 2 (not 3) and no S/L/T/E. Perfect.

But let me think of a more common word: ""CHAIR"" has A in position 2, but I is also in the word. Maybe better to test more consonants. 

Another good option is ""PRAIN"" (but not a common word). 

Let's stick with ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A in position 2.
- No S, L, T, E.

This seems optimal.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms guess 1).
   - R, N, K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in position 3) and C (not in position 1).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and C.
- Does not contain S, L, T, E, R, N, K.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places C somewhere other than position 1.

Remaining common letters to try: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for words with A and C, avoiding the excluded letters. Possible candidates:
- CHAOS (but O and S are allowed? Wait, S is excluded.)
- PACED (E is excluded.)
- COBIA (but B and I are allowed, but C is in position 1 which is invalid.)
- DICOT (but T is excluded.)
- CHAMP (P is allowed, but M and P are allowed, but C is position 1 invalid.)
- CHAID (but D and I are allowed, but C is position 1 invalid.)
- PACED (E excluded.)
- COBIA (C position 1 invalid.)
- CAID_ (needs 5 letters.)

Let’s try ""CHAID"" – but C is position 1 which is invalid.
Let’s try ""MACHO"" – C is position 2 (allowed), A is position 2 (allowed), no excluded letters.
Check letters: M, A, C, H, O. None are in the excluded list. This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PACED"" – E is excluded.
""PACED"" is invalid because of E.

""MACHO"" seems good:
- Contains A and C.
- A is in position 2 (not 3) – allowed.
- C is in position 2 – allowed (not position 1).
- No S, L, T, E, R, N, K.

Let me verify: M, A, C, H, O – all allowed letters.

Thus, ""MACHO"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is not in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E do not appear anywhere in the word.

To make the next guess, we want:
- A word that still includes A (but not in position 3).
- A word that avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
- A word that introduces several new, common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, M, C, D, P, H, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U. Since A is already confirmed, we might consider words like:
- CRANE (but E is excluded)
- CHAIN (but I and N are good)
- RADIO (but O and I are good)
- PIANO (but O is good)

Looking at common patterns, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- C, R, N are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed).
- E is excluded, but let's try ""CRANK"" instead which has A in position 2 and avoids E/S/L/T.

Actually, let's pick ""CHARD"":
- C, H, R, D are new common letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- No S, L, T, E.

But ""CHARD"" might be less common. Let's go with ""CRANE"" minus the E: ""CRAN_"". The most common ending would be ""CRANK"" but that's 5 letters. Actually, ""CRANK"" is valid and fits all criteria.

Wait, ""CRANK"" has A in position 2 (not 3) and no S/L/T/E. Perfect.

But let me think of a more common word: ""CHAIR"" has A in position 2, but I is also in the word. Maybe better to test more consonants. 

Another good option is ""PRAIN"" (but not a common word). 

Let's stick with ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A in position 2.
- No S, L, T, E.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (very common ending letter)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

The letters S, L, T, E do not appear anywhere in the word.\n\nTo make the next guess, we want:\n- A word that still includes A (but not in position 3).\n- A word that avoids S, L, T, E entirely.\n- A word that introduces several new, common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nGood consonants to try next are R, N, M, C, D, P, H, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U. Since A is already confirmed, we might consider words like:\n- CRANE (but E is excluded)\n- CHAIN (but I and N are good)\n- RADIO (but O and I are good)\n- PIANO (but O is good)\n\nLooking at common patterns, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:\n- C, R, N are common consonants.\n- A is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed).\n- E is excluded, but let\'s try ""CRANK"" instead which has A in position 2 and avoids E/S/L/T.\n\nActually, let\'s pick ""CHARD"":\n- C, H, R, D are new common letters.\n- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).\n- No S, L, T, E.\n\nBut ""CHARD"" might be less common.

From the four guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).

3. MACHO → M(x) A(✓) C(✓) H(x) O(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - C is confirmed in position 3.
   - M, H, O are NOT in the word.

4. VACID → V(✓) A(✓) C(✓) I(x) D(x)
   - V is confirmed in position 1.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - C is confirmed in position 3.
   - I and D are NOT in the word.

So the word is now fully determined: V A C _ _
and the only remaining letters to fill position 4 must be from the letters not yet excluded.

Letters excluded so far: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, M, H, O, I, D.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form V A C _ _. The only common English word fitting this pattern with the remaining letters is VACUB (but that's not a valid word), VACYG (invalid), VACUP (invalid), VACU_ (invalid), etc. 

Wait, let me check valid words: VACAY (but Y is allowed and A is already in position 2, so V A C A Y - but this would have A in position 4, which is allowed since A is only confirmed in position 2. However, this would be VACAY, but A is already in position 2, and we haven't ruled out A appearing again. 

But looking at the pattern V A C _ _, the only valid word seems to be VACAY, but let me check if Y is allowed - yes, Y is not in the excluded list. However, VACAY is a valid word meaning a vacation. 

But wait, is VACAY a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is. And it fits V A C A Y, with Y in position 5. 

Let me verify:
- V (position 1) ✓
- A (position 2) ✓
- C (position 3) ✓
- A (position 4) - not yet ruled out
- Y (position 5) - not in excluded list

Thus, VACAY is the only remaining valid word fitting all constraints.
