### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): A, S, L  

Positions ruled out for each known letter:
- A: cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- S: cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- L: cannot be in position 2  

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, L exactly once each  
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E, N, T  
3. Places A, S, L in still-allowed positions  
4. Uses two new letters (from the remaining alphabet) to gain more information  

Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and L are already used)

A good candidate is “CLASH”:
- Contains C, L, A, S, H  
- L is in position 2 (allowed)  
- A is in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in position 3) → invalid.

Next candidate: “PLASM” – but M is allowed, yet S would be in position 4 (invalid).  

Candidate: “SALAD” – but A is repeated, and we don’t know if letters repeat.  

Candidate: “SCALD”
- S (allowed in position 1?) – no, S cannot be in position 1 (from SLANT feedback).  

Candidate: “SCALP”
- S cannot be in position 1.  

Candidate: “SCALY”
- S cannot be in position 1.  

Candidate: “SCALD” again fails S in position 1.  

Let me try “SCALD” again with positions:
S C A L D  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
S is in 1 – invalid.  

Try “SCALD” rotated: “DSCAL” – not a word.  

Alternative: “SCALD” is invalid because of S in 1.  

Try “SCALD” variant: “SCALD” is the only common one.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: R, O, E
- Letters present somewhere: A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

I want a word that:
1. Contains A and S (since they're in the word)
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4
4. Uses new common letters to maximize information

Good candidate: SLANT
- Contains S and A
- Doesn't contain R, O, E
- S is in position 1 (allowed since original S was in position 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed since original A was in position 1)
- Adds new common letters L, N, T

Let's re-examine the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, L
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, N, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – L cannot be in position 2.

I want a word that:
- Uses A, S, L (all must appear).
- Avoids R, O, E, N, T.
- Places A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Places S in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Places L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Candidate: SALAD
- Contains A, S, L.
- A in position 2 and 4 (allowed).
- S in position 1 – but this is disallowed (S cannot be in position 1).
Next candidate: SALSA
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 and 4 – position 1 is disallowed.
Next candidate: SLASH
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 and 4 – position 1 disallowed.
Next candidate: PLAID
- Contains A, L, but not S – violates requirement.
Next candidate: GLASS
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 and 4 – position 1 disallowed.
Next candidate: CLASP
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- A in position 3 – but position 3 is disallowed for A.
Next candidate: SCALP
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 – disallowed.
Next candidate: CLAPS
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses new letters C, P (not in forbidden list).

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: R, O, E
- Letters present somewhere: A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

I want a word that:
1. Contains A and S (since they're in the word)
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4
4. Uses new common letters to maximize information

Good candidate: SLANT
- Contains S and A

From the new feedback on CLAPS:

C(x) – C is not in the word.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:

Letters that must appear: A, L, P, S (and S is fixed in position 5).  
Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, E, N, T, C.  
Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (since it was wrong in 1 and 3, and 5 is taken by S).
- L cannot be in positions 2, 5 (position 5 is S, so irrelevant anyway).
- P cannot be in position 4.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 4.
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1, 2, or 3.
- S is fixed in position 5.

We have three letters to place (A, L, P) in positions 1-4, with constraints:
- A ∈ {2,4}
- L ∈ {1,3,4}
- P ∈ {1,2,3}

Let’s list possible arrangements:

Case 1: A in position 2
Then positions 1,3,4 must contain L and P.
Possible permutations:
- L P _  (but A is in 2, S in 5 → word: L A P S _ – invalid, needs 5 letters)
Actually, we need to fill positions 1,3,4 with L and P and one more letter (but we only have A,L,P,S so far). Wait, we have 5 positions total, with S fixed at 5. So positions 1-4 must be filled with A,L,P and one more letter, but we only have A,L,P,S. This suggests we need to use A,L,P in positions 1-4 plus S at 5.

Let me rephrase: word structure is _ _ _ _ S, with positions 1-4 to be filled by A, L, P and one more letter (but we only have A,L,P,S). This implies we must use A, L, P in positions 1-4, but we have three letters for four positions – impossible. This suggests my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, the word must be 5 letters, with S in position 5. The other four positions must be filled with A, L, P and one more letter (not in forbidden list). But from previous feedback, we have only identified A, L, P as present; there might be a fifth letter we haven't tested yet.

But we have limited guesses left. Let me think differently: the word must contain A, L, P, S (with S at 5), and cannot contain R,O,E,N,T,C. So the fifth letter must be from remaining unused common letters like D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

But since we have only three known letters (A,L,P) plus S, and need one more letter, let's try to find a word that fits:

Possible structure: [X] [A or L or P] [A or L or P] [A or L or P] S

But we have to place A, L, P in positions 1-4, which is impossible with three letters. This indicates that one of A, L, P must appear twice, or we missed a letter.

Looking back at feedback:
- CLAPS feedback: C(x) L(-) A(-) P(-) S(✓)
This means L, A, P are all in the word but not in their tested positions. It does not necessarily mean each appears once. They could appear once or twice.

Given that, and S is at 5, let's consider possible arrangements:

Option 1: A in position 2
Then word structure: _ A _ _ S
Positions 1,3,4 must contain L and P (and possibly another A or L or P).
But we have only three letters (A,L,P) to place in four positions – impossible unless one repeats.

Option 2: A in position 4
Then word structure: _ _ _ A S
Positions 1,2,3 must contain L and P (and possibly another letter).

Let's try A in position 4:
_ _ _ A S
Positions 1,2,3 must be filled with L, P and one more letter (not forbidden).
Possible letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common words ending in AS:
- PLAYS: but Y is allowed, and P,L,A are present. Check constraints:
  - P in position 1: allowed (P not ruled out at 1)
  - L in position 2: but feedback says L is not in position 2 (from SLANT feedback: L(-) means not in position 2). So L in position 2 is invalid.
  
- GLASS: but S is already at 5, and this would have two S's. But S is only confirmed once.
  
- FLASK: but F is not tested, and K is allowed. Check:
  - F not forbidden (ok)
  - L in position 2: invalid (from SLANT feedback)
  
- CLASP: but C is forbidden (from CLAPS feedback)
  
- SALPS: but S is at 5, and this would have S in 1 and 5 – possible but uncommon.

Let me try A in position 2:
_ A _ _ S
Positions 1,3,4 must contain L and P. Need one more letter.
Possible word: PLAID – but D is allowed, but I is allowed, but this has P,L,A in positions 1,3,2 – but A is in 2, so:
P A L _ S – but then P in 1, A in 2, L in 3, need one more letter in 4. Common word: P A L ? S
PALMS: M is allowed. Check constraints:
- P in 1: allowed
- A in 2: allowed
- L in 3: allowed (L was not ruled out at 3)
- M in 4: allowed
- S in 5: correct
This seems valid.

Check letters: P, A, L, M, S – all allowed, contains required A,L,P,S, and M is new.

Thus, the next guess is PALMS.
</think>

<guess>PALMS</guess>",PALMS,"From the new feedback on CLAPS:

C(x) – C is not in the word.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:

Letters that must appear: A, L, P, S (and S is fixed in position 5).  
Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, E, N, T, C.  
Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (since it was wrong in 1 and 3, and 5 is taken by S).
- L cannot be in positions 2, 5 (position 5 is S, so irrelevant anyway).
- P cannot be in position 4.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 4.
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1, 2, or 3.
- S is fixed in position 5.

We have three letters to place (A, L, P) in positions 1-4, with constraints:
- A ∈ {2,4}
- L ∈ {1,3,4}

Actually, we need to fill positions 1,3,4 with L and P and one more letter (but we only have A,L,P,S so far). Wait, we have 5 positions total, with S fixed at 5. So positions 1-4 must be filled with A,L,P and one more letter, but we only have A,L,P,S. This suggests we need to use A,L,P in positions 1-4 plus S at 5.

Let me rephrase: word structure is _ _ _ _ S, with positions 1-4 to be filled by A, L, P and one more letter (but we only have A,L,P,S). This implies we must use A, L, P in positions 1-4, but we have three letters for four positions – impossible. This suggests my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, the word must be 5 letters, with S in position 5. The other four positions must be filled with A, L, P and one more letter (not in forbidden list). But from previous feedback, we have only identified A, L, P as present; there might be a fifth letter we haven't tested yet.

But we have limited guesses left. Let me think differently: the word must contain A, L, P, S (with S at 5), and cannot contain R,O,E,N,T,C. So the fifth letter must be from remaining unused common letters like D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

But since we have only three known letters (A,L,P) plus S, and need one more letter, let's try to find a word that fits:

Possible structure: [X] [A or L or P] [A or L or P] [A or L or P] S

But we have to place A, L, P in positions 1-4, which is impossible with three letters. This indicates that one of A, L, P must appear twice, or we missed a letter.

Looking back at feedback:
- CLAPS feedback: C(x) L(-) A(-) P(-) S(✓)
This means L, A, P are all in the word but not in their tested positions. It does not necessarily mean each appears once. They could appear once or twice.

Given that, and S is at 5, let's consider possible arrangements:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: R, O, E
- Letters present somewhere: A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

I want a word that:
1. Contains A and S (since they're in the word)
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4
4. Uses new common letters to maximize information

Good candidate: SLANT
- Contains S and A
- Doesn't contain R, O, E
- S is in position 1 (allowed since original S was in position 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed since original A was in position 1)
- Adds new common letters L, N, T

Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's re-examine the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, L
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, N, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – L cannot be in position 2.

I want a word that:
- Uses A, S, L (all must appear).
- Avoids R, O, E, N, T.
- Places A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Places S in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Places L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Candidate: SALAD
- Contains A, S, L.
- A in position 2 and 4 (allowed).
- S in position 1 – but this is disallowed (S cannot be in position 1).
Next candidate: SALSA
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 and 4 – position 1 is disallowed.
Next candidate: SLASH
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 and 4 – position 1 disallowed.
Next candidate: PLAID
- Contains A, L, but not S – violates requirement.
Next candidate: GLASS
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 and 4 – position 1 disallowed.
Next candidate: CLASP
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- A in position 3 – but position 3 is disallowed for A.
Next candidate: SCALP
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 1 – disallowed.
Next candidate: CLAPS
- Contains A, S, L.
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses new letters C, P (not in forbidden list).

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Model answer is not in the correct format
Guess 4: CLAPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) A(-) P(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CLAPS:

C(x) – C is not in the word.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:

Letters that must appear: A, L, P, S (and S is fixed in position 5).  
Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, E, N, T, C.  
Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (since it was wrong in 1 and 3, and 5 is taken by S).
- L cannot be in positions 2, 5 (position 5 is S, so irrelevant anyway).
- P cannot be in position 4.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 4.
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1, 2, or 3.
- S is fixed in position 5.

We have three letters to place (A, L, P) in positions 1-4, with constraints:
- A ∈ {2,4}
- L ∈ {1,3,4}
- P ∈ {1,2,3}

Let’s list possible arrangements:

Case 1: A in position 2
Then positions 1,3,4 must contain L and P.
Possible permutations:
- L P _  (but A is in 2, S in 5 → word: L A P S _ – invalid, needs 5 letters)
Actually, we need to fill positions 1,3,4 with L and P and one more letter (but we only have A,L,P,S so far). Wait, we have 5 positions total, with S fixed at 5. So positions 1-4 must be filled with A,L,P and one more letter, but we only have A,L,P,S. This suggests we need to use A,L,P in positions 1-4 plus S at 5.

Let me rephrase: word structure is _ _ _ _ S, with positions 1-4 to be filled by A, L, P and one more letter (but we only have A,L,P,S). This implies we must use A, L, P in positions 1-4, but we have three letters for four positions – impossible. This suggests my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, the word must be 5 letters, with S in position 5. The other four positions must be filled with A, L, P and one more letter (not in forbidden list). But from previous feedback, we have only identified A, L, P as present; there might be a fifth letter we haven't tested yet.

But we have limited guesses left. Let me think differently: the word must contain A, L, P, S (with S at 5), and cannot contain R,O,E,N,T,C. So the fifth letter must be from remaining unused common letters like D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

But since we have only three known letters (A,L,P) plus S, and need one more letter, let's try to find a word that fits:

Possible structure: [X] [A or L or P] [A or L or P] [A or L or P] S

But we have to place A, L, P in positions 1-4, which is impossible with three letters. This indicates that one of A, L, P must appear twice, or we missed a letter.

Looking back at feedback:
- CLAPS feedback: C(x) L(-) A(-) P(-) S(✓)
This means L, A, P are all in the word but not in their tested positions. It does not necessarily mean each appears once. They could appear once or twice.

Given that, and S is at 5, let's consider possible arrangements:

Option 1: A in position 2
Then word structure: _ A _ _ S
Positions 1,3,4 must contain L and P (and possibly another A or L or P).
But we have only three letters (A,L,P) to place in four positions – impossible unless one repeats.

Option 2: A in position 4
Then word structure: _ _ _ A S
Positions 1,2,3 must contain L and P (and possibly another letter).

Let's try A in position 4:
_ _ _ A S
Positions 1,2,3 must be filled with L, P and one more letter (not forbidden).
Possible letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common words ending in AS:
- PLAYS: but Y is allowed, and P,L,A are present. Check constraints:
  - P in position 1: allowed (P not ruled out at 1)
  - L in position 2: but feedback says L is not in position 2 (from SLANT feedback: L(-) means not in position 2). So L in position 2 is invalid.
  
- GLASS: but S is already at 5, and this would have two S's. But S is only confirmed once.
  
- FLASK: but F is not tested, and K is allowed. Check:
  - F not forbidden (ok)
  - L in position 2: invalid (from SLANT feedback)
  
- CLASP: but C is forbidden (from CLAPS feedback)
  
- SALPS: but S is at 5, and this would have S in 1 and 5 – possible but uncommon.

Let me try A in position 2:
_ A _ _ S
Positions 1,3,4 must contain L and P. Need one more letter.
Possible word: PLAID – but D is allowed, but I is allowed, but this has P,L,A in positions 1,3,2 – but A is in 2, so:
P A L _ S – but then P in 1, A in 2, L in 3, need one more letter in 4. Common word: P A L ? S
PALMS: M is allowed. Check constraints:
- P in 1: allowed
- A in 2: allowed
- L in 3: allowed (L was not ruled out at 3)
- M in 4: allowed
- S in 5: correct
This seems valid.

Check letters: P, A, L, M, S – all allowed, contains required A,L,P,S, and M is new.

Thus, the next guess is PALMS.

From the latest feedback on PALMS:

P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 1.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 2.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 3.  
M(x) – M is NOT in the word.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:

- Fixed letters: A in position 2, S in position 5.  
- Letters that must appear somewhere: P, L (both not yet placed correctly).  
- Letters that cannot appear: R, O, E, N, T, C, M.  

The word structure is: _ A _ _ S, with P and L still to be placed in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We have three positions left to fill (1, 3, 4) using the letters P and L plus one more letter (not yet used and not forbidden). The remaining allowed letters are among D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: P in position 1  
Then positions 3 and 4 must contain L and one new letter.  
Possible word: P A L ? S → PALYS (Y allowed) – but Y is uncommon.  
Or P A ? L S → PA?LS – need a letter. Common word: P A I L S – but I is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
- P in 1: allowed (only ruled out in position 1 by PALMS feedback, but that was marked as - not ✓). Wait, PALMS feedback says P(-) meaning P is in word but not in position 1. So P cannot be in 1.  
Thus P cannot be in 1.  

Case 2: P in position 3  
Then positions 1 and 4 must contain L and one new letter.  
Structure: _ A P _ S  
Need L in 1 or 4.  
- L A P _ S → LAP?S – need a letter in 4. Common word: LAPDS? No.  
- _ A P L S – but position 4 is L, which is allowed (L was not ruled out at 4).  
So structure: ? A P L S – need a letter in 1.  
Allowed letters: D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y.  
Common word: V A P L S – no.  
G A P L S – no.  
H A P L S – no.  
I A P L S – no.  
K A P L S – no.  
D A P L S – no.  
None common.

Case 3: P in position 4  
Then positions 1 and 3 must contain L and one new letter.  
Structure: _ A _ P S  
Need L in 1 or 3.  
- L A _ P S → L A ? P S – need letter in 3. Allowed: D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y.  
Common word: L A I P S – no.  
- _ A L P S → ? A L P S – need letter in 1.  
Common word: D A L P S – no.  
G A L P S – no.  
H A L P S – no.  
I A L P S – no.  
K A L P S – no.  
V A L P S – no.  
Y A L P S – no.  

Let me reconsider: we have 5 positions, with A in 2 and S in 5. We must use P and L exactly once each in positions 1, 3, 4. So the three letters are A, S, P, L and one more letter (but we only have 5 positions). This implies the word must be a permutation of A, S, P, L with S fixed at 5 and A at 2. Thus the letters are A, S, P, L and one more letter must be from the allowed set.

But we have only 5 positions: positions 1,3,4 must be filled with P, L and one more letter (but we only have P and L left). This is impossible unless one of P or L appears twice, which is not indicated.

Wait, the word must contain A, P, L, S (with S at 5 and A at 2), and cannot contain any forbidden letters. Thus the remaining positions 1, 3, 4 must be filled with P and L. This is only possible if one of P or L is repeated, which is not indicated. This suggests an inconsistency, meaning our assumption that all three (P, L, A, S) are distinct may be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback: CLAPS feedback said L(-), A(-), P(-) – meaning each is in the word but not in their tested positions. It does not specify they are distinct. It's possible one letter appears twice.

Given that, and the structure _ A _ _ S, with P and L needing placement, the only way to fit them is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   ? A ? ? S  

We must place P and L in 1,3,4. The remaining position will take one of P or L again, but this is unlikely. More likely, we missed a letter.

Looking back, the word must be 5 letters, with A in 2 and S in 5, and must contain P and L. Thus the letters are A, S, P, L and one more letter (not forbidden). The only common word fitting this is:

G A P L S – but G is allowed, but this seems obscure.  
H A P L S – no.  
D A P L S – no.  

Wait, let's try L in position 1, P in position 3, and need a letter in 4:  
L A P ? S – need a letter in 4. Common word: L A P I S – but I is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
- L in 1: allowed (only ruled out in 2 and 3)  
- A in 2: correct  
- P in 3: allowed (only ruled out in 1 and 4)  
- I in 4: allowed  
- S in 5: correct  

This seems valid. The word is LAPIS.

<guess>LAPIS</guess>",LAPIS,"From the latest feedback on PALMS:

P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 1.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 2.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 3.  
M(x) – M is NOT in the word.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:

- Fixed letters: A in position 2, S in position 5.  
- Letters that must appear somewhere: P, L (both not yet placed correctly).  
- Letters that cannot appear: R, O, E, N, T, C, M.  

The word structure is: _ A _ _ S, with P and L still to be placed in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We have three positions left to fill (1, 3, 4) using the letters P and L plus one more letter (not yet used and not forbidden). The remaining allowed letters are among D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: P in position 1  
Then positions 3 and 4 must contain L and one new letter.  
Possible word: P A L ? S → PALYS (Y allowed) – but Y is uncommon.  
Or P A ? L S → PA?LS – need a letter. Common word: P A I L S – but I is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
- P in 1: allowed (only ruled out in position 1 by PALMS feedback, but that was marked as - not ✓). Wait, PALMS feedback says P(-) meaning P is in word but not in position 1. So P cannot be in 1.  
Thus P cannot be in 1.  

Case 2: P in position 3  
Then positions 1 and 4 must contain L and one new letter.  
Structure: _ A P _ S  
Need L in 1 or 4.  
- L A P _ S → LAP?S – need a letter in 4. Common word: LAPDS? No.  
- _ A P L S – but position 4 is L, which is allowed (L was not ruled out at 4).  
So structure: ? A P L S – need a letter in 1.  
Allowed letters: D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y.  
Common word: V A P L S – no.  
G A P L S – no.  
H A P L S – no.  
I A P L S – no.  
K A P L S – no.  
D A P L S – no.  
None common.

Case 3: P in position 4  
Then positions 1 and 3 must contain L and one new letter.  
Structure: _ A _ P S  
Need L in 1 or 3.  
- L A _ P S → L A ? P S – need letter in 3. Allowed: D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y.  
Common word: L A I P S – no.  
- _ A L P S → ? A L P S – need letter in 1.  
Common word: D A L P S – no.  
G A L P S – no.  
H A L P S – no.  
I A L P S – no.  
K A L P S – no.  
V A L P S – no.  
Y A L P S – no.  

Let me reconsider: we have 5 positions, with A in 2 and S in 5. We must use P and L exactly once each in positions 1, 3, 4. So the three letters are A, S, P, L and one more letter (but we only have 5 positions). This implies the word must be a permutation of A, S, P, L with S fixed at 5 and A at 2. Thus the letters are A, S, P, L and one more letter must be from the allowed set.

But we have only 5 positions: positions 1,3,4 must be filled with P, L and one more letter (but we only have P and L left). This is impossible unless one of P or L appears twice, which is not indicated.

Wait, the word must contain A, P, L, S (with S at 5 and A at 2), and cannot contain any forbidden letters. Thus the remaining positions 1, 3, 4 must be filled with P and L. This is only possible if one of P or L is repeated, which is not indicated. This suggests an inconsistency, meaning our assumption that all three (P, L, A, S) are distinct may be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback: CLAPS feedback said L(-), A(-), P(-) – meaning each is in the word but not in their tested positions. It does not specify they are distinct. It's possible one letter appears twice.

Given that, and the structure _ A _ _ S, with P and L needing placement, the only way to fit them is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   ? A ? ? S  

We must place P and L in 1,3,4. The remaining position will take one of P or L again, but this is unlikely. More likely, we missed a letter.

Looking back, the word must be 5 letters, with A in 2 and S in 5, and must contain P and L. Thus the letters are A, S, P, L and one more letter (not forbidden). The only common word fitting this is:

G A P L S – but G is allowed, but this seems obscure.  
H A P L S – no.  
D A P L S – no.  

Wait, let's try L in position 1, P in position 3, and need a letter in 4:  
L A P ? S – need a letter in 4. Common word: L A P I S – but I is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
- L in 1: allowed (only ruled out in 2 and 3)  
- A in 2: correct  
- P in 3: allowed (only ruled out in 1 and 4)  
- I in 4: allowed  
- S in 5: correct  

This seems valid. The word is LAPIS.
