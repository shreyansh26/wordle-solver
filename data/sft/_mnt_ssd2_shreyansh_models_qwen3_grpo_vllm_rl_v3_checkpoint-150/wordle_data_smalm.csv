For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains 5 of these top common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces new common letters. ""STAIN"" is tempting, but it has an I and N which are good, but S would be in position 1 (allowed since S was in position 4 before and now we’re moving it). However, A would be in position 3 here, which is fine.

But a better choice might be ""SLANT"":
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (was in 4, so new position is fine).
- A is in position 2 (was in 1, so new position is fine).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, O, E.
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces new common letters. ""STAIN"" is tempting, but it has an I and N which are good, but S would be in position 1 (allowed since S was in position 4 before and now we’re moving it). However, A would be in position 3 here, which is fine.

But a better choice might be ""SLANT"":
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (was in 4, so new position is fine).
- A is in position 2 (was in 1, so new position is fine).

This seems like a strong second guess.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains 5 of these top common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, O, E.
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces new common letters. ""STAIN"" is tempting, but it has an I and N which are good, but S would be in position 1 (allowed since S was in position 4 before and now we’re moving it). However, A would be in position 3 here, which is fine.

But a better choice might be ""SLANT"":
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (was in 4, so new position is fine).
- A is in position 2 (was in 1, so new position is fine).

This seems like a strong second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SLANT:

- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word and in their exact spots: S _ A _ _
- Letters in the word but in wrong spots: L (cannot be in position 2)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E, N, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in the third position.
3. Contains L somewhere other than position 2.
4. Does not contain R, O, E, N, T.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for words that fit S _ A _ _ with L somewhere and no forbidden letters. Possible candidates:
- S C A L Y
- S P A C E (but E is forbidden)
- S L A I N (but N is forbidden)
- S C A L D
- S P A L D
- S C A L K

""SCALY"" seems promising:
- S C A L Y
- Contains L in position 4 (allowed, since L was only excluded from position 2)
- No forbidden letters (R, O, E, N, T)
- Uses common letters C and Y

Another candidate is ""SCALD"":
- S C A L D
- Also valid, but ""SCALY"" might be more common as a word.

Let’s go with ""SCALY"" as it’s a valid word and fits all constraints.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SCALY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SCALY:

- S(✓): S is correct in position 1 (already known).
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is correct in position 3 (already known).
- L(✓): L is correct in position 4 (was previously only known to be in the word but not in position 2).
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So now we know the exact pattern: S _ A L _

Letters still forbidden: R, O, E, N, T, C, Y.

Letters already placed: S (1), A (3), L (4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 3.
3. Has L in position 4.
4. Does not contain R, O, E, N, T, C, Y.
5. The remaining positions (2 and 5) must be filled with allowed letters.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need to find words matching S _ A L _.

Possible candidates:
- S B A L L (but double L is unlikely)
- S B A L K
- S P A L L
- S P A L D
- S H A L K
- S M A L L
- S M A L D
- S F A L K
- S G A L K
- S H A L D
- S M A L K

Looking at these, ""SMALL"" seems like a strong candidate:
- S M A L L
- Fits the pattern S _ A L _
- Uses M and L; L is already known to be in position 4, so position 5 could be L (double L)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters.

Another good option is ""S P A L L"", but ""SMALL"" is more common.

Let's go with ""SMALL"" as it's a valid word and fits all constraints.

Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)

Guess 4: SMALL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) A(✓) L(✓) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SMALL:

- S(✓) – position 1 correct (already known)
- M(✓) – position 2 correct (new)
- A(✓) – position 3 correct (already known)
- L(✓) – position 4 correct (already known)
- L(-) – the final letter is L but it’s in the wrong place (position 5)

So the pattern is now:
S M A L _

The last letter must be L but it can’t be in position 5 (because the feedback says it’s wrong there). However, we already have L in position 4, and no rule prevents letters from appearing more than once. The only constraint is that the letter in position 5 must be L, but the feedback explicitly says L is not in position 5. This seems contradictory at first glance, but the only resolution is that the word must be S M A L L, which has two L’s. The feedback for SMALL indicates that the first four letters are correct, and the fifth letter is L but in the wrong position. Since L is already correctly placed in position 4, it cannot be in position 5, so the only possible word is SMALL itself. Therefore, the secret word must be SMALL.

From the feedback on the two SMALL guesses:

- Positions 1-4 are all correct: S M A L _  
- The fifth letter is L but it is marked “-” (wrong position).  
- Since L is already locked into position 4, it cannot appear again in position 5.  
- Therefore the only remaining letter that can occupy position 5 must be L, but that would duplicate L in the word.  
- However, the feedback explicitly says L is not in position 5, so position 5 must be a letter we have not yet tried that is compatible with the rest of the pattern.

Looking back at previous constraints:
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, N, T, C, Y.
- Used letters in fixed positions: S, M, A, L.
- Remaining possible letters for position 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, etc.

The pattern is S M A L ?.  
Valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters:
- SMALT (a rare blue glass)  
- SMALL (but we just tried it and L is rejected at the end)  
- SMALD (a variant spelling of “smold”)  
- SMALI (not a standard word)  
- SMALP (not a word)  
- SMALH (not a word)  
- SMALG (not a word)  

The only dictionary-valid word left is SMALT.
