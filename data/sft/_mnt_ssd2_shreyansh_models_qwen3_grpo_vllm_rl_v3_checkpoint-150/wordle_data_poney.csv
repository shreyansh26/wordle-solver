For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - again hitting common letters. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage for English 5-letter words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S
- Has 5 letters total

Next I want a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in different positions
2. Introduces new common consonants (avoiding A, R, S)
3. Uses other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.)

A good candidate is ""OCEAN"":
- O moves to position 1
- E moves to position 3
- Introduces C, N (common consonants)
- Uses A (but we know A is out from first guess - wait, A was marked x in AROSE, so A is not in the word at all)

Oops, ""OCEAN"" has A, which we know is not in the word. Let me rethink.

Better candidates:
- ""TOWER"" - but R is out
- ""PONED"" - but D is less common
- ""IONIC"" - but C is less common
- ""UNTIE"" - uses U, N, T, I, E

""UNTIE"" seems good:
- U, N, T, I, E - all new letters except E
- E is in the word (from AROSE feedback)
- O is still needed (from AROSE feedback), but ""UNTIE"" doesn't have O - so this is bad

Wait, we know O is in the word (from AROSE feedback), so every guess must include O and E in different positions.

Let me try ""OPIUM"":
- O in position 1
- P, I, U are new
- M is new
- E is missing - can't do

""OILED"":
- O in position 1
- I, L, E, D - but E is in position 4 (was in 5 before)
- But E was in position 5 before and marked -, so position 4 is new
- However, E could still be in position 5, so this is risky

Better: ""OCHER"":
- O in position 1
- C, H, E, R - but R is out

""OCEAN"" was bad because of A.

""OFTEN"":
- O in position 1
- F, T, E, N - E in position 4
- But E was in position 5 before, so 4 is new
- However, this doesn't use O in a new position (it's still 1)

Wait, in AROSE, O was position 3 and marked -, so O is not in position 3. Similarly, E was position 5 and marked -, so E is not in position 5.

Let's try ""OFTEN"" - but E is in position 4, which is new, and O is in position 1 (new). This seems good.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - again hitting common letters. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage for English 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S
- Has 5 letters total

Next I want a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in different positions
2. Introduces new common consonants (avoiding A, R, S)
3. Uses other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.)

A good candidate is ""OCEAN"":
- O moves to position 1
- E moves to position 3
- Introduces C, N (common consonants)
- Uses A (but we know A is out from first guess - wait, A was marked x in AROSE, so A is not in the word at all)

Oops, ""OCEAN"" has A, which we know is not in the word. Let me rethink.

Better candidates:
- ""TOWER"" - but R is out
- ""PONED"" - but D is less common
- ""IONIC"" - but C is less common
- ""UNTIE"" - uses U, N, T, I, E

""UNTIE"" seems good:
- U, N, T, I, E - all new letters except E
- E is in the word (from AROSE feedback)
- O is still needed (from AROSE feedback), but ""UNTIE"" doesn't have O - so this is bad

Wait, we know O is in the word (from AROSE feedback), so every guess must include O and E in different positions.

Let me try ""OPIUM"":
- O in position 1
- P, I, U are new
- M is new
- E is missing - can't do

""OILED"":
- O in position 1
- I, L, E, D - but E is in position 4 (was in 5 before)
- But E was in position 5 before and marked -, so position 4 is new
- However, E could still be in position 5, so this is risky

Better: ""OCHER"":
- O in position 1
- C, H, E, R - but R is out

""OCEAN"" was bad because of A.

""OFTEN"":
- O in position 1
- F, T, E, N - E in position 4
- But E was in position 5 before, so 4 is new
- However, this doesn't use O in a new position (it's still 1)

Wait, in AROSE, O was position 3 and marked -, so O is not in position 3. Similarly, E was position 5 and marked -, so E is not in position 5.

Let's try ""OFTEN"" - but E is in position 4, which is new, and O is in position 1 (new). This seems good.

But ""OFTEN"" has F which is less common.

Another option: ""TONEY"":
- T, O, N, E, Y
- O in position 2
- E in position 4
- T, N, Y are new
- This seems better

Yes, ""TONEY"" looks good:
- Uses O and E in new positions (2 and 4)
- Introduces T, N, Y (all new letters)
- Avoids A, R, S

Guess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 2 (TONEY) the feedback is:
- T: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is in position 2
- N: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → N is in position 3
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → E is in position 4
- Y: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → Y is in position 5

So the secret word pattern is: _ O N E Y

The only missing letter is the first character. We know from Guess 1 (AROSE) that:
- A, R, S are not in the word at all (x)
- O, E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively (but Guess 2 confirmed O in 2, E in 4)

So the first letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. Common consonants not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in ""ONEY"":
- BONEY
- CONEY
- DONEY (not a valid word)
- FONEY (not valid)
- MONEY
- PONEY (not valid)
- WONEY (not valid)

Valid options: BONEY, CONEY, MONEY

""ONEY"" is not valid, so the possible words are BONEY, CONEY, MONEY.

Let's choose MONEY as it's a common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - again hitting common letters. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage for English 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S
- Has 5 letters total

Next I want a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in different positions
2. Introduces new common consonants (avoiding A, R, S)
3. Uses other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.)

A good candidate is ""OCEAN"":
- O moves to position 1
- E moves to position 3
- Introduces C, N (common consonants)
- Uses A (but we know A is out from first guess - wait, A was marked x in AROSE, so A is not in the word at all)

Oops, ""OCEAN"" has A, which we know is not in the word. Let me rethink.

Better candidates:
- ""TOWER"" - but R is out
- ""PONED"" - but D is less common
- ""IONIC"" - but C is less common
- ""UNTIE"" - uses U, N, T, I, E

""UNTIE"" seems good:
- U, N, T, I, E - all new letters except E
- E is in the word (from AROSE feedback)
- O is still needed (from AROSE feedback), but ""UNTIE"" doesn't have O - so this is bad

Wait, we know O is in the word (from AROSE feedback), so every guess must include O and E in different positions.

Let me try ""OPIUM"":
- O in position 1
- P, I, U are new
- M is new
- E is missing - can't do

""OILED"":
- O in position 1
- I, L, E, D - but E is in position 4 (was in 5 before)
- But E was in position 5 before and marked -, so position 4 is new
- However, E could still be in position 5, so this is risky

Better: ""OCHER"":
- O in position 1
- C, H, E, R - but R is out

""OCEAN"" was bad because of A.

""OFTEN"":
- O in position 1
- F, T, E, N - E in position 4
- But E was in position 5 before, so 4 is new
- However, this doesn't use O in a new position (it's still 1)

Wait, in AROSE, O was position 3 and marked -, so O is not in position 3. Similarly, E was position 5 and marked -, so E is not in position 5.

Let's try ""OFTEN"" - but E is in position 4, which is new, and O is in position 1 (new). This seems good.

But ""OFTEN"" has F which is less common.

Another option: ""TONEY"":
- T, O, N, E, Y
- O in position 2
- E in position 4
- T, N, Y are new
- This seems better

Yes, ""TONEY"" looks good:
- Uses O and E in new positions (2 and 4)
- Introduces T, N, Y (all new letters)
- Avoids A, R, S

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 2 (TONEY) the feedback is:
- T: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is in position 2
- N: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → N is in position 3
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → E is in position 4
- Y: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → Y is in position 5

So the secret word pattern is: _ O N E Y

The only missing letter is the first character. We know from Guess 1 (AROSE) that:
- A, R, S are not in the word at all (x)
- O, E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively (but Guess 2 confirmed O in 2, E in 4)

So the first letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. Common consonants not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

- BONEY

- DONEY (not a valid word)
- FONEY (not valid)

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, R, S are not in the word.  
   – O and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

2. TONEY → T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)  
   – O is now fixed in position 2.  
   – N is fixed in position 3.  
   – E is fixed in position 4.  
   – Y is fixed in position 5.  
   – T is not in the word.

3. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)  
   – M is not in the word.  
   – Confirms again that positions 2-5 are O-N-E-Y.

So the pattern is: _ O N E Y

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, T, M.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ?ONEY that is valid and whose first letter is not any of A, R, S, T, M.

This seems good.\n\nBut ""OFTEN"" has F which is less common.\n\nAnother option: ""TONEY"":\n- T, O, N, E, Y\n- O in position 2\n- E in position 4\n- T, N, Y are new\n- This seems better\n\nYes, ""TONEY"" looks good:\n- Uses O and E in new positions (2 and 4)\n- Introduces T, N, Y (all new letters)\n- Avoids A, R, S\n\n<guess>TONEY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From Guess 2 (TONEY) the feedback is:\n- T: not in the word (x)\n- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is in position 2\n- N: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → N is in position 3\n- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → E is in position 4\n- Y: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → Y is in position 5\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ O N E Y\n\nThe only missing letter is the first character.

We now know the pattern is _ O N E Y and that the first letter is NOT any of A, R, S, T, M, H, C.

The only remaining common consonants that can start a valid 5-letter word ending in “ONEY” are B and D (among others, but they produce invalid words).

- BONEY is valid.
- DONEY is not a valid English word.

Thus, the only remaining valid guess is BONEY.
