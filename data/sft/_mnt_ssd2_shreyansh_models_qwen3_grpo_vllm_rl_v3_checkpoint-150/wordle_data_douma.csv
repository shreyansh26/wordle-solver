For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Next step: pick a word that
- includes A in a different position (not 3rd),
- avoids C, R, N, E,
- uses other common letters (S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “SLAID” (S, L, A, I, D). It places A in position 3 again, which we already know is wrong, so let’s try “PLAID” (P, L, A, I, D) instead. A is now in position 3 again—still bad. Let’s try “STOAT” (S, T, O, A, T) – A is in position 4, which is new. It avoids C, R, N, E and uses common letters.

Another option is “ABOUT” (A, B, O, U, T) – A is in position 1, and it uses B, O, U, T which are all common and not ruled out.

I’ll choose “ABOUT” because it introduces five new letters (B, O, U, T) and places A in position 1, which we haven’t tested yet.

Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions):

Remaining common letters to test: S, L, I, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, U plus two new letters from the allowed set, and respects the positional exclusions above.

- U cannot be in positions 3 or 4  

A promising pattern:

“OASID” is not a valid word.  
“OASIS” uses S and I, both allowed, and is a valid word.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that ARE in the word (but wrong positions):  
- A (from CRANE, ABOUT, OASIS)  
- O (from ABOUT, OASIS)  
- U (from ABOUT)

So the secret word contains A, O, U and must avoid positions:
- A cannot be in 1, 2, 3 (from ABOUT and OASIS) → A must be in 4 or 5  
- O cannot be in 1, 3, 4 (from OASIS) → O must be in 2 or 5  
- U cannot be in 3, 4 → U must be in 1, 2, or 5

Also, remaining unused common letters to test: D, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place A, O, U under the constraints:
- A must be in 4 or 5  
- O must be in 2 or 5  
- U must be in 1, 2, or 5  

Case 1: A in 4, O in 2, U in 1 → U O _ A _  
Need a valid 5-letter word: U O _ A _ → “UO…A…” – no common word.

Case 2: A in 4, O in 5, U in 1 or 2  
- U _ _ A O  
  – U _ _ A O → “UL…AO” – no word  
- _ U _ A O

Case 3: A in 5, O in 2, U in 1 or 3

Let’s try a different approach: list 5-letter words containing A, O, U with the constraints.

Valid word: “PAULA” – contains P, A, U, L, A – but has two A’s, and A must be unique? Not necessarily, but let’s see.

Check positions:
- P (new)  
- A (pos 2) – allowed (A can be in 2)  
- U (pos 3) – allowed (U can be in 3)  
- L (new)  
- A (pos 5) – allowed (A can be in 5)  

But we already know O must be in the word, and PAULA doesn’t have O. So discard.

Next: “COUGH” – has C (excluded), so no.

“DOULA” – has D, O, U, L, A  
Check positions:
- D (new)

DOULA is a valid word, uses A, O, U, and introduces D and L.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Next step: pick a word that
- includes A in a different position (not 3rd),
- avoids C, R, N, E,
- uses other common letters (S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “SLAID” (S, L, A, I, D). It places A in position 3 again, which we already know is wrong, so let’s try “PLAID” (P, L, A, I, D) instead. A is now in position 3 again—still bad. Let’s try “STOAT” (S, T, O, A, T) – A is in position 4, which is new. It avoids C, R, N, E and uses common letters.

Another option is “ABOUT” (A, B, O, U, T) – A is in position 1, and it uses B, O, U, T which are all common and not ruled out.

I’ll choose “ABOUT” because it introduces five new letters (B, O, U, T) and places A in position 1, which we haven’t tested yet.

Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, B, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions):  
- A (from CRANE and ABOUT)  
- O (from ABOUT)  
- U (from ABOUT)

So the secret word contains A, O, U and must avoid positions 1, 3, 4 for A and positions 3, 4 for O and U.

Remaining common letters to test: S, L, I, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, U plus two new letters from the allowed set, and respects the positional exclusions above.

Let’s try to place A, O, U in new positions:

- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4  
- U cannot be in positions 3 or 4  

A promising pattern:  
Put A in position 2, O in position 1, U in position 5 → O A _ _ U  
Fill the two middle letters with new common letters: S, L, I, D, etc.

“OASID” is not a valid word.  
“OASIS” uses S and I, both allowed, and is a valid word.

Check positions:  
O (pos 1) – not excluded for O  
A (pos 2) – not excluded for A  
S (pos 3) – new letter, allowed  
I (pos 4) – new letter, allowed  
S (pos 5) – allowed, and S is already common.

So “OASIS” is a valid guess that tests A in position 2, O in position 1, U is not used here but we can check later if needed, and introduces S and I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Next step: pick a word that
- includes A in a different position (not 3rd),
- avoids C, R, N, E,
- uses other common letters (S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “SLAID” (S, L, A, I, D). It places A in position 3 again, which we already know is wrong, so let’s try “PLAID” (P, L, A, I, D) instead. A is now in position 3 again—still bad. Let’s try “STOAT” (S, T, O, A, T) – A is in position 4, which is new. It avoids C, R, N, E and uses common letters.

Another option is “ABOUT” (A, B, O, U, T) – A is in position 1, and it uses B, O, U, T which are all common and not ruled out.

I’ll choose “ABOUT” because it introduces five new letters (B, O, U, T) and places A in position 1, which we haven’t tested yet.

Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, B, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions):  
- A (from CRANE and ABOUT)  
- O (from ABOUT)  
- U (from ABOUT)

So the secret word contains A, O, U and must avoid positions 1, 3, 4 for A and positions 3, 4 for O and U.

Remaining common letters to test: S, L, I, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, U plus two new letters from the allowed set, and respects the positional exclusions above.

Let’s try to place A, O, U in new positions:

- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4  
- U cannot be in positions 3 or 4  

A promising pattern:  
Put A in position 2, O in position 1, U in position 5 → O A _ _ U  
Fill the two middle letters with new common letters: S, L, I, D, etc.

“OASID” is not a valid word.  
“OASIS” uses S and I, both allowed, and is a valid word.

Check positions:  
O (pos 1) – not excluded for O  
A (pos 2) – not excluded for A  
S (pos 3) – new letter, allowed  
I (pos 4) – new letter, allowed  
S (pos 5) – allowed, and S is already common.

So “OASIS” is a valid guess that tests A in position 2, O in position 1, U is not used here but we can check later if needed, and introduces S and I.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, B, T, S, I  
Letters that ARE in the word (but wrong positions):  
- A (from CRANE, ABOUT, OASIS)  
- O (from ABOUT, OASIS)  
- U (from ABOUT)

So the secret word contains A, O, U and must avoid positions:
- A cannot be in 1, 2, 3 (from ABOUT and OASIS) → A must be in 4 or 5  
- O cannot be in 1, 3, 4 (from OASIS) → O must be in 2 or 5  
- U cannot be in 3, 4 → U must be in 1, 2, or 5

Also, remaining unused common letters to test: D, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place A, O, U under the constraints:
- A must be in 4 or 5  
- O must be in 2 or 5  
- U must be in 1, 2, or 5  

Case 1: A in 4, O in 2, U in 1 → U O _ A _  
Need a valid 5-letter word: U O _ A _ → “UO…A…” – no common word.

Case 2: A in 4, O in 5, U in 1 or 2  
- U _ _ A O  
  – U _ _ A O → “UL…AO” – no word  
- _ U _ A O  
  – _ U _ A O → “DU…AO” – no word  
Try “MUDAY” – invalid.

Case 3: A in 5, O in 2, U in 1 or 3  
- U _ O _ A  
  – U _ O _ A → “UDO…A” – no word  
- _ _ O _ A – but O must be in 2, so _ O _ _ A  
  – _ O _ _ A → “HO…OA” – no word  
Try “POULA” – invalid.

Case 4: A in 5, O in 2, U in 1  
- U O _ _ A  
  – U O _ _ A → “UOG…A” – no word  

Try “GOUAL” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: list 5-letter words containing A, O, U with the constraints.

Valid word: “PAULA” – contains P, A, U, L, A – but has two A’s, and A must be unique? Not necessarily, but let’s see.

Check positions:
- P (new)  
- A (pos 2) – allowed (A can be in 2)  
- U (pos 3) – allowed (U can be in 3)  
- L (new)  
- A (pos 5) – allowed (A can be in 5)  

But we already know O must be in the word, and PAULA doesn’t have O. So discard.

Next: “COUGH” – has C (excluded), so no.

“DOULA” – has D, O, U, L, A  
Check positions:
- D (new)  
- O (pos 2) – allowed (O can be in 2)  
- U (pos 3) – allowed (U can be in 3)  
- L (new)  
- A (pos 5) – allowed (A can be in 5)  

DOULA is a valid word, uses A, O, U, and introduces D and L.

Let’s try DOULA.

Positions:
D (1) – new  
O (2) – allowed for O  
U (3) – allowed for U  
L (4) – new  
A (5) – allowed for A  

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback on DOUGH we now know:

- Positions 1-3 and 5 are locked: D O U _ A  
- Position 4 must be a letter that has NOT yet been ruled out.  
- Letters already excluded: C, R, N, E, B, T, S, I, L, G, H  
- Remaining common letters: F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  

The only valid 5-letter English word that fits D O U _ A is:

- D O U B A → but B is excluded  
- D O U K A → “DOUKA” is not a standard word  
- D O U M A → “DOUMA” is not a standard word  
- D O U P A → “DOUPA” is not a standard word  
- D O U V A → “DOUVA” is not a standard word  
- D O U W A → “DOUWA” is not a standard word  
- D O U Y A → “DOUYA” is not a standard word  
- D O U Z A → “DOUZA” is not a standard word  

The only remaining valid word is **DOUBA**, but B is excluded. This suggests the only possible word left is **DOULA**, but we already tried that and L was excluded. This implies the word must be **DOUGH**, but G and H are excluded. This seems like a contradiction, indicating we might have missed a word.

Rechecking: The pattern is D O U _ A. The actual valid word fitting this is **DOULA** (already tried) and **DOUGH** (already tried). This suggests the word must be **DOUBA**, but B is excluded. This indicates we might have missed a word or need to reconsider.

Upon closer inspection, the word **DOUMA** exists but is not common. However, it fits the pattern D O U M A. Since M has not been excluded, this could be the word.

But let's verify: M has not been used or excluded yet. The word **DOUMA** is valid (a type of cormorant). Given the constraints, this seems the most likely.

However, the more common word **DOUGH** was tried with G and H excluded. This suggests the word might actually be **DOULA**, but L was excluded. This indicates a possible error in earlier steps.

Re-evaluating: The feedback from DOULA was D(✓) O(✓) U(✓) L(x) A(✓), which locks positions 1-3 and 5 as D O U _ A. The only valid word left is **DOUMA**, as other possibilities either use excluded letters or are not words.

Thus, the next guess must be **DOUMA**.

But wait, let's check if **DOUMA** is valid. Yes, it is a valid 5-letter word (a type of bird). And M has not been excluded.

Therefore, the correct guess is **DOUMA**.
