### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination covers several high-frequency letters and can provide good information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is NOT in the word at all.
- E is NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, and O, but not S or E.  
The positions of A, R, and O are still unknown, but they cannot be in the positions they occupied in AROSE (A≠1, R≠2, O≠3).

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps A, R, and O (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Moves A, R, and O to new positions (not their old ones).
3. Introduces new common letters (like T, I, N, L) to test for additional letters.

A good candidate is “TAROT”:
- T (new letter)
- A (in position 2, new spot)
- R (in position 3, new spot)
- O (in position 4, new spot)
- T (new letter, second T)

This tests new positions for A, R, O and adds T.

From the latest feedback on NORIA:

- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(✓): O is in position 2.
- R(✓): R is in position 3 (confirmed again).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: A
- Positions 1 and 4: unknown, but N is in the word (not in position 1), and we have eliminated S, E, T, I.

Letters we know are in the word: N, O, R, A.
Letters we know are not in the word: S, E, T, I.

So the word must be of the form:
- _ O R _ A
- And N must appear in either position 4 (since it can't be in position 1).

Thus the only possible arrangement is:
- _ O R N A

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ORNA. The only common word that fits is ""FORNA"" but that's not a valid English word. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, the pattern is _ O R _ A with N somewhere in positions 1 or 4. But N can't be in position 1 (from feedback), so N must be in position 4. Thus the word must be _ O R N A.

Looking at valid 5-letter words, the only one that fits is ""DORNA"" but that's not valid. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, let's list possible letters for position 1 and 4:
- Position 1: can be any letter except S, E, T, I (and must be a valid starting letter)
- Position 4: must be N (since N is in the word and can't be in position 1)

So the word must be _ O R N A. The only valid English word fitting this is ""F O R N A"" but that's not valid. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine:

From feedback:
- N is in the word but not in position 1.
- O is in position 2.
- R is in position 3.
- A is in position 5.

So the word is _ O R _ A with N in position 4 (since it can't be in position 1). Thus: _ O R N A.

Valid 5-letter words ending in ORNA: ""FORNA"" is invalid, ""PORNA"" is invalid, ""TORNA"" is invalid. 

Wait, maybe the word is ""NORIA"" but that was already guessed. 

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""CRONY"" but that doesn't fit the A in position 5. 

Actually, the pattern is _ O R _ A with N in position 4. The only valid word is ""DORNA"" but that's not valid. 

Wait, let me think of words ending in ORA: ""CORAL"" but that doesn't fit. 

I think I'm missing something. Let me re-express:

The word must be:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: A
- N must be in position 4 (since it can't be in position 1)
Thus: _ O R N A

The only valid English word fitting this is ""F O R N A"" but that's not valid. 

Wait, maybe the word is ""N O R M A"" but that doesn't fit the feedback. 

I think the correct word must be ""N O R M A"" but let's check:

NORMA:
- N: position 1 (but feedback says N is not in position 1) - so invalid.

I'm stuck. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From NORIA:
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(✓): O is in position 2.
- R(✓): R is in position 3.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in position 5.

Thus the word is _ O R _ A with N in position 4. The only possible word is ""D O R N A"" but that's invalid. 

Wait, maybe the word is ""M O R N A"" - ""MORNA"" is a valid word (a type of boat or a dialectal term).

Let me check:
- M O R N A:
  - M: new letter
  - O: position 2 (matches)
  - R: position 3 (matches)
  - N: position 4 (matches, since N is in the word but not in position 1)
  - A: position 5 (matches)

This fits all feedback. 

Thus, the next guess is ""MORNA"".
