For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters and can help identify vowels and common consonants early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but S is not the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good letters to try next: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) – S is in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- SORRY – S in position 1, skip.
- CRISP – S in position 4, and uses C, R, I, P. Avoids banned letters.
- SHINS – S in position 1 and 4, skip position 1.
- SHOCK – S in position 1, skip.
- CHINS – C, H, I, N, S – S is in position 5, which is allowed. Uses C, H, I, N.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters and can help identify vowels and common consonants early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but S is not the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good letters to try next: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) – S is in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- SORRY – S in position 1, skip.
- CRISP – S in position 4, and uses C, R, I, P. Avoids banned letters.
- SHINS – S in position 1 and 4, skip position 1.
- SHOCK – S in position 1, skip.
- CHINS – C, H, I, N, S – S is in position 5, which is allowed. Uses C, H, I, N.

I’ll go with CHINS as it places S in position 5 (allowed) and tests new letters C, H, I, N.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, E, C, H, I.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - S is in the word and is in the correct position 5.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and N must appear somewhere in positions 1-3 (since position 4 is ruled out).

Good remaining consonants to test: R, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out)

A strong next guess would place N in position 1 and test common remaining letters.  
Possible candidate: NURDS – but D and R are fine, U is fine, and N is in position 1.  
Another candidate: NURKS – but K is less common.  
Another: BONUS – B, O, N, U, S: B is fine, O and U are fine, N is in position 3 (allowed), S is fixed at 5.

BONUS satisfies:
- Ends with S (✓)
- Uses N in position 3 (allowed)
- Tests B, O, U
- Avoids all banned letters

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters and can help identify vowels and common consonants early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but S is not the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good letters to try next: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) – S is in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- SORRY – S in position 1, skip.
- CRISP – S in position 4, and uses C, R, I, P. Avoids banned letters.
- SHINS – S in position 1 and 4, skip position 1.
- SHOCK – S in position 1, skip.
- CHINS – C, H, I, N, S – S is in position 5, which is allowed. Uses C, H, I, N.

I’ll go with CHINS as it places S in position 5 (allowed) and tests new letters C, H, I, N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) N(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, E, C, H, I.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - S is in the word and is in the correct position 5.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and N must appear somewhere in positions 1-3 (since position 4 is ruled out).

Good remaining consonants to test: R, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out)

A strong next guess would place N in position 1 and test common remaining letters.  
Possible candidate: NURDS – but D and R are fine, U is fine, and N is in position 1.  
Another candidate: NURKS – but K is less common.  
Another: BONUS – B, O, N, U, S: B is fine, O and U are fine, N is in position 3 (allowed), S is fixed at 5.

BONUS satisfies:
- Ends with S (✓)
- Uses N in position 3 (allowed)
- Tests B, O, U
- Avoids all banned letters

Let’s go with BONUS.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds we now have:

1. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, H, I, B, U  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
   - O is in the word and is in position 2.  
   - N is in the word and is in position 3.  
   - S is in the word and is in position 5.  

So the pattern is: _ O N _ S

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: none (A, E, I, O, U are all handled).

Common consonants to test: D, F, G, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y

Let’s pick common ones that fit:
- Position 1: D, F, G, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same set

A good candidate would be a word like:
- F O N D S – but FOND is a 4-letter word, so FONDS? Not common.
- D O N K S – DONKS is obscure.
- R O N D S – RONDS is not a standard word.
- P O N D S – PONDS is valid (plural of pond).
- G O N D S – GONDS is not recognized.
- V O N D S – VONDS is not recognized.

PONDS seems the best among these, but let me think of more common words.

Another approach: use common consonants in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s try:
- R O N D S – not common.
- D O N K S – not common.
- P O N G S – PONGS is valid (past tense of pawn, or slang for pongs).
- M O N K S – MONSEK is not a word.
- V O N T S – VONT is not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching _ O N _ S:

- PONDS
- PONKS
- PONGS
- VONDS – invalid
- DONGS – DONGS is valid (currency units in some countries)
- FONDS – FONDS is valid (French for funds, accepted in English dictionaries)

Between PONDS, PONGS, DONGS, FONDS, PONKS:

PONDS is the most common English word.

Let’s go with PONDS.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all:  
   L, A, T, E, C, H, I, B, U, P, D

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   - O is in position 2  
   - N is in position 3  
   - S is in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ O N _ S

We still need two letters for positions 1 and 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
   F, G, J, K, M, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels are already exhausted (A, E, I, O, U all handled).

Common consonants left: F, G, K, M, R, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ?ON?S.

Possible candidates:
- FONKS – obscure, not common
- GONKS – same
- MONKS – valid (one who takes monk’s vows)
- RONKS – not standard
- VONKS – not standard
- WONKS – slang, but valid
- YONKS – not standard

Among these, MONKS is the clearest valid word.

Let’s go with MONKS.
