### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- STARE

These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opener that covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good feedback on consonant positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, E, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, S, G (each appeared as “-” twice, so they must be present but not in the positions tried so far)

Positions already ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or position 4 again (from STING) – so N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STING) – so S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- G cannot be in position 5 (from STING) – so G must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We still need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining allowed letters (no C, R, A, E, T, I) and places N, S, G in allowable spots.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E are out; I is out)

A good candidate is “BUNG” but that’s only 4 letters.  
“PUNGS” uses P, U, N, G, S – all allowed letters and positions for these known letters.

Check positions:
- P: new, allowed
- U: new vowel, allowed
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- G: position 4 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- STARE

These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opener that covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good feedback on consonant positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains N, but not in the 4th position.
- It definitely does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 4th).
2. Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
3. Use other common consonants and vowels.

Good candidate letters left: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A strong next word would be ""STING"":
- S, T, I, G are all new letters.
- N is moved to the 3rd position (was 4th before).
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) are used.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, E, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, S, G (each appeared as “-” twice, so they must be present but not in the positions tried so far)

Positions already ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or position 4 again (from STING) – so N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STING) – so S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- G cannot be in position 5 (from STING) – so G must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We still need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining allowed letters (no C, R, A, E, T, I) and places N, S, G in allowable spots.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E are out; I is out)

A good candidate is “BUNG” but that’s only 4 letters.  
“PUNGS” uses P, U, N, G, S – all allowed letters and positions for these known letters.

Check positions:
- P: new, allowed
- U: new vowel, allowed
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- G: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 1)

So “PUNGS” satisfies all constraints.
