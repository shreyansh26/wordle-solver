### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)

What we now know:
1. The word contains A and I.
2. A is in position 2 (because TAINT gave A(✓)).
3. I is in position 3 (because TAINT gave I(✓)).
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, T, N.
5. Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern so far is: _ A I _ _

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and I in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Is a valid English word.

Possible candidates: BAIUM, CAIRN, DAISY, FAIRY, GAINS, HAIRY, MAINT, PAINT, VAINT, etc.

But I must avoid any letters that have been marked x. Ruled out letters: R, O, S, E, T, N.

Looking at these candidates:
- BAIUM: uses B, U, M – all allowed.
- CAIRN: uses C, R – but R is ruled out.
- DAISY: uses D, S – but S is ruled out.
- FAIRY: uses F, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- GAINS: uses G, N – but N is ruled out.
- HAIRY: uses H, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- MAINT: uses M, T – but T is ruled out.
- PAINT: uses P, T – but T is ruled out.
- VAINT: uses V, N – but N is ruled out.

The only candidate that fits all constraints is BAIUM (but BAIUM is a valid word, though rare). However, let me double-check if there are more common words.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" is invalid (R). ""DAISY"" invalid (S). ""FAIRY"" invalid (R). ""GAINS"" invalid (N). ""HAIRY"" invalid (R). ""MAINT"" invalid (T). ""PAINT"" invalid (T). ""VAINT"" invalid (N).

So ""BAIUM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern with allowed letters. But let me think of others.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding R, O, S, E, T, N:

Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BAIUM (valid but uncommon)
- CAIUS (but C is allowed, U is allowed, S is not – invalid)
- FAIRY (R invalid)
- HAIRY (R invalid)
- PAINT (T invalid)
- VAINT (N invalid)

Another approach: maybe ""CAI"" as root, but need to find valid words. ""CAI"" is a root in some words, but ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – but ""CAIDS"" isn't a word.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding ruled out letters, the only valid word seems to be BAIUM. However, let me check if there are others.

Another candidate: ""DAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" = ""DAILY"" – but D is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. ""DAILY"" is a valid word.

Let me check ""DAILY"":
- D (position 1): not ruled out.
- A (position 2): confirmed ✓.
- I (position 3): confirmed ✓.
- L (position 4): not ruled out.
- Y (position 5): not ruled out.

""DAILY"" fits all constraints.

Similarly, ""PAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – but S is ruled out. ""PAIKS"" invalid.

""CAI"" + ""S"" + ""T"" – invalid letters.

""MAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""VAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""BAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" – ""BAILY"" (but ""BAILY"" is a surname, not sure if valid).

""DAILY"" seems the best.

Another candidate: ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""PAI"" + ""N"" + ""S"" – invalid.

Thus, the best valid word seems to be ""DAILY"".

But let me check if ""DAILY"" is allowed. Yes, ""DAILY"" is a valid English word meaning ""every day"".

So, I'll guess DAILY.

- GAINS: uses G, N – but N is ruled out.
- HAIRY: uses H, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- MAINT: uses M, T – but T is ruled out.
- PAINT: uses P, T – but T is ruled out.
- VAINT: uses V, N – but N is ruled out.

The only candidate that fits all constraints is BAIUM (but BAIUM is a valid word, though rare). However, let me double-check if there are more common words.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" is invalid (R). ""DAISY"" invalid (S). ""FAIRY"" invalid (R). ""GAINS"" invalid (N). ""HAIRY"" invalid (R). ""MAINT"" invalid (T). ""PAINT"" invalid (T). ""VAINT"" invalid (N).

So ""BAIUM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern with allowed letters. But let me think of others.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding R, O, S, E, T, N:

Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BAIUM (valid but uncommon)
- CAIUS (but C is allowed, U is allowed, S is not – invalid)
- FAIRY (R invalid)
- HAIRY (R invalid)
- PAINT (T invalid)
- VAINT (N invalid)

Another approach: maybe ""CAI"" as root, but need to find valid words. ""CAI"" is a root in some words, but ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – but ""CAIDS"" isn't a word.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding ruled out letters, the only valid word seems to be BAIUM. However, let me check if there are others.

Another candidate: ""DAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" = ""DAILY"" – but D is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. ""DAILY"" is a valid word.

Let me check ""DAILY"":
- D (position 1): not ruled out.
- A (position 2): confirmed ✓.
- I (position 3): confirmed ✓.
- L (position 4): not ruled out.
- Y (position 5): not ruled out.

""DAILY"" fits all constraints.

Similarly, ""PAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – but S is ruled out. ""PAIKS"" invalid.

""CAI"" + ""S"" + ""T"" – invalid letters.

""MAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""VAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""BAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" – ""BAILY"" (but ""BAILY"" is a surname, not sure if valid).

""DAILY"" seems the best.

Another candidate: ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""PAI"" + ""N"" + ""S"" – invalid.

Thus, the best valid word seems to be ""DAILY"".

But let me check if ""DAILY"" is allowed. Yes, ""DAILY"" is a valid English word meaning ""every day"".

So, I'll guess DAILY.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are all x: they are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does not contain R, O, S, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are ruled out).

A strong second guess might be ""TAINT"":
- Has A in position 2 (different from position 1 in AROSE).
- Uses T, I, N, which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)

What we now know:
1. The word contains A and I.
2. A is in position 2 (because TAINT gave A(✓)).
3. I is in position 3 (because TAINT gave I(✓)).
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, T, N.
5. Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern so far is: _ A I _ _

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and I in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Is a valid English word.

Possible candidates: BAIUM, CAIRN, DAISY, FAIRY, GAINS, HAIRY, MAINT, PAINT, VAINT, etc.

But I must avoid any letters that have been marked x. Ruled out letters: R, O, S, E, T, N.

Looking at these candidates:
- BAIUM: uses B, U, M – all allowed.
- CAIRN: uses C, R – but R is ruled out.
- DAISY: uses D, S – but S is ruled out.
- FAIRY: uses F, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- GAINS: uses G, N – but N is ruled out.
- HAIRY: uses H, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- MAINT: uses M, T – but T is ruled out.
- PAINT: uses P, T – but T is ruled out.
- VAINT: uses V, N – but N is ruled out.

The only candidate that fits all constraints is BAIUM (but BAIUM is a valid word, though rare). However, let me double-check if there are more common words.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" is invalid (R). ""DAISY"" invalid (S). ""FAIRY"" invalid (R). ""GAINS"" invalid (N). ""HAIRY"" invalid (R). ""MAINT"" invalid (T). ""PAINT"" invalid (T). ""VAINT"" invalid (N).

So ""BAIUM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern with allowed letters. But let me think of others.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding R, O, S, E, T, N:

Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BAIUM (valid but uncommon)
- CAIUS (but C is allowed, U is allowed, S is not – invalid)
- FAIRY (R invalid)
- HAIRY (R invalid)
- PAINT (T invalid)
- VAINT (N invalid)

Another approach: maybe ""CAI"" as root, but need to find valid words. ""CAI"" is a root in some words, but ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – but ""CAIDS"" isn't a word.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding ruled out letters, the only valid word seems to be BAIUM. However, let me check if there are others.

Another candidate: ""DAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" = ""DAILY"" – but D is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. ""DAILY"" is a valid word.

Let me check ""DAILY"":
- D (position 1): not ruled out.
- A (position 2): confirmed ✓.
- I (position 3): confirmed ✓.
- L (position 4): not ruled out.
- Y (position 5): not ruled out.

""DAILY"" fits all constraints.

Similarly, ""PAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – but S is ruled out. ""PAIKS"" invalid.

""CAI"" + ""S"" + ""T"" – invalid letters.

""MAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""VAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""BAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" – ""BAILY"" (but ""BAILY"" is a surname, not sure if valid).

""DAILY"" seems the best.

Another candidate: ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""PAI"" + ""N"" + ""S"" – invalid.

Thus, the best valid word seems to be ""DAILY"".

But let me check if ""DAILY"" is allowed. Yes, ""DAILY"" is a valid English word meaning ""every day"".

So, I'll guess DAILY.

<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A exists but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E do not exist.

2. TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - I is confirmed in position 3.
   - T and N do not exist.

3. DAILY → D(x) A(✓) I(✓) L(-) Y(x)
   - A and I positions confirmed again.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D and Y are not in the word.

Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, N, D, Y.

Pattern so far: _ A I _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus L, which must appear somewhere).

We know L is in the word but not in position 4. So L must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- L A I _ _ (L in position 1)
- _ A I _ L (L in position 5)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- LAIRD (but D is ruled out)
- LAIKY (but Y is ruled out)
- LAMPS (S is ruled out)
- LAUGH (H and G allowed, U allowed)
- LAVES (S and E ruled out)
- LAKES (S and E ruled out)
- LAMBS (S ruled out)
- LANKS (S and N ruled out)
- LAPPY (Y ruled out)
- LARVA (R and V allowed, A already used)
- LARKS (S and K allowed, but S ruled out)
- LAVAS (S ruled out)
- LAMPS (S ruled out)
- LANCE (C and E allowed, but E ruled out)
- LANKY (Y ruled out)
- LAMBS (S ruled out)
- LARKY (Y ruled out)
- LARKS (S ruled out)
- LAVES (E ruled out)
- LANKS (N ruled out)
- LAMPS (S ruled out)
- LARVA (R allowed, V allowed)
- LARVS (S ruled out)
- LARKS (S ruled out)
- LANKS (N ruled out)

From this, ""LARVA"" seems valid:
- L in position 1 (allowed, since L must be in 1 or 5)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- R in position 3 (but I is confirmed in position 3 – conflict)
Oops, ""LARVA"" has R in position 3, but we know I must be in position 3. So invalid.

Next candidate: ""LAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – invalid letters.

Looking again at pattern _ A I _ _, and L must be in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- L A I _ _
  - LAIRD (D ruled out)
  - LAIKY (Y ruled out)
  - LAMPS (S ruled out)
  - LAUGH (H and G allowed, U allowed)
  - LAVES (E ruled out)
  - LAMBS (S ruled out)
  - LANKS (N ruled out)
  - LARKS (S ruled out)
  - LANKY (Y ruled out)
  - LAPPY (Y ruled out)
  - LARVA (R in position 3 – conflict with I)
  - LAVAS (S ruled out)
  - LANKS (N ruled out)
  - LAMPS (S ruled out)

- _ A I _ L
  - B A I L _ (BAILY – Y ruled out)
  - C A I L _ (CAIL_ – no valid word)
  - F A I L _ (FAILS – S ruled out)
  - G A I L _ (GAILE – not a word)
  - H A I L _ (HAILE – not a word)
  - M A I L _ (MAILED – 6 letters)
  - P A I L _ (PAILED – 6 letters)
  - V A I L _ (VAILED – 6 letters)
  - C A I R L – invalid (R ruled out)
  - B A I R L – invalid (R ruled out)

Looking at ""LAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – invalid.

The only valid word fitting seems to be ""LAUGH"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- I in position 3 (confirmed)
- G and H in positions 4 and 5 (not ruled out)
- U in position 4 (not ruled out)

""LAUGH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

But wait, ""LAUGH"" has:
- L A I G H – but we know L must be in position 1 or 5. Here L is in position 1, which is allowed.
- G and H are not ruled out.
- U is not in the word (from DAILY feedback, U wasn't tested, but that's fine).

Thus, ""LAUGH"" is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are all x: they are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does not contain R, O, S, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are ruled out).

A strong second guess might be ""TAINT"":
- Has A in position 2 (different from position 1 in AROSE).
- Uses T, I, N, which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)

What we now know:
1. The word contains A and I.
2. A is in position 2 (because TAINT gave A(✓)).
3. I is in position 3 (because TAINT gave I(✓)).
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, T, N.
5. Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern so far is: _ A I _ _

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and I in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Is a valid English word.

Possible candidates: BAIUM, CAIRN, DAISY, FAIRY, GAINS, HAIRY, MAINT, PAINT, VAINT, etc.

But I must avoid any letters that have been marked x. Ruled out letters: R, O, S, E, T, N.

Looking at these candidates:
- BAIUM: uses B, U, M – all allowed.
- CAIRN: uses C, R – but R is ruled out.
- DAISY: uses D, S – but S is ruled out.
- FAIRY: uses F, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- GAINS: uses G, N – but N is ruled out.
- HAIRY: uses H, R, Y – but R is ruled out.
- MAINT: uses M, T – but T is ruled out.
- PAINT: uses P, T – but T is ruled out.
- VAINT: uses V, N – but N is ruled out.

The only candidate that fits all constraints is BAIUM (but BAIUM is a valid word, though rare). However, let me double-check if there are more common words.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" is invalid (R). ""DAISY"" invalid (S). ""FAIRY"" invalid (R). ""GAINS"" invalid (N). ""HAIRY"" invalid (R). ""MAINT"" invalid (T). ""PAINT"" invalid (T). ""VAINT"" invalid (N).

So ""BAIUM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern with allowed letters. But let me think of others.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding R, O, S, E, T, N:

Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BAIUM (valid but uncommon)
- CAIUS (but C is allowed, U is allowed, S is not – invalid)
- FAIRY (R invalid)
- HAIRY (R invalid)
- PAINT (T invalid)
- VAINT (N invalid)

Another approach: maybe ""CAI"" as root, but need to find valid words. ""CAI"" is a root in some words, but ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – but ""CAIDS"" isn't a word.

Looking at the pattern _ A I _ _, and avoiding ruled out letters, the only valid word seems to be BAIUM. However, let me check if there are others.

Another candidate: ""DAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" = ""DAILY"" – but D is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. ""DAILY"" is a valid word.

Let me check ""DAILY"":
- D (position 1): not ruled out.
- A (position 2): confirmed ✓.
- I (position 3): confirmed ✓.
- L (position 4): not ruled out.
- Y (position 5): not ruled out.

""DAILY"" fits all constraints.

Similarly, ""PAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – but S is ruled out. ""PAIKS"" invalid.

""CAI"" + ""S"" + ""T"" – invalid letters.

""MAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""VAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""BAI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" – ""BAILY"" (but ""BAILY"" is a surname, not sure if valid).

""DAILY"" seems the best.

Another candidate: ""CAI"" + ""D"" + ""S"" – invalid.

""PAI"" + ""N"" + ""S"" – invalid.

Thus, the best valid word seems to be ""DAILY"".

But let me check if ""DAILY"" is allowed. Yes, ""DAILY"" is a valid English word meaning ""every day"".

So, I'll guess DAILY.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: DAILY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(✓) L(-) Y(x)

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A exists but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E do not exist.

2. TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - I is confirmed in position 3.
   - T and N do not exist.

3. DAILY → D(x) A(✓) I(✓) L(-) Y(x)
   - A and I positions confirmed again.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D and Y are not in the word.

Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, N, D, Y.

Pattern so far: _ A I _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus L, which must appear somewhere).

We know L is in the word but not in position 4. So L must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- L A I _ _ (L in position 1)
- _ A I _ L (L in position 5)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- LAIRD (but D is ruled out)
- LAIKY (but Y is ruled out)
- LAMPS (S is ruled out)
- LAUGH (H and G allowed, U allowed)
- LAVES (S and E ruled out)
- LAKES (S and E ruled out)
- LAMBS (S ruled out)
- LANKS (S and N ruled out)
- LAPPY (Y ruled out)
- LARVA (R and V allowed, A already used)
- LARKS (S and K allowed, but S ruled out)
- LAVAS (S ruled out)
- LAMPS (S ruled out)
- LANCE (C and E allowed, but E ruled out)
- LANKY (Y ruled out)
- LAMBS (S ruled out)
- LARKY (Y ruled out)
- LARKS (S ruled out)
- LAVES (E ruled out)
- LANKS (N ruled out)
- LAMPS (S ruled out)
- LARVA (R allowed, V allowed)
- LARVS (S ruled out)
- LARKS (S ruled out)
- LANKS (N ruled out)

From this, ""LARVA"" seems valid:
- L in position 1 (allowed, since L must be in 1 or 5)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- R in position 3 (but I is confirmed in position 3 – conflict)
Oops, ""LARVA"" has R in position 3, but we know I must be in position 3. So invalid.

Next candidate: ""LAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – invalid letters.

Looking again at pattern _ A I _ _, and L must be in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- L A I _ _
  - LAIRD (D ruled out)
  - LAIKY (Y ruled out)
  - LAMPS (S ruled out)
  - LAUGH (H and G allowed, U allowed)
  - LAVES (E ruled out)
  - LAMBS (S ruled out)
  - LANKS (N ruled out)
  - LARKS (S ruled out)
  - LANKY (Y ruled out)
  - LAPPY (Y ruled out)
  - LARVA (R in position 3 – conflict with I)
  - LAVAS (S ruled out)
  - LANKS (N ruled out)
  - LAMPS (S ruled out)

- _ A I _ L
  - B A I L _ (BAILY – Y ruled out)
  - C A I L _ (CAIL_ – no valid word)
  - F A I L _ (FAILS – S ruled out)
  - G A I L _ (GAILE – not a word)
  - H A I L _ (HAILE – not a word)
  - M A I L _ (MAILED – 6 letters)
  - P A I L _ (PAILED – 6 letters)
  - V A I L _ (VAILED – 6 letters)
  - C A I R L – invalid (R ruled out)
  - B A I R L – invalid (R ruled out)

Looking at ""LAI"" + ""K"" + ""S"" – invalid.

The only valid word fitting seems to be ""LAUGH"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (confirmed)
- I in position 3 (confirmed)
- G and H in positions 4 and 5 (not ruled out)
- U in position 4 (not ruled out)

""LAUGH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

But wait, ""LAUGH"" has:
- L A I G H – but we know L must be in position 1 or 5. Here L is in position 1, which is allowed.
- G and H are not ruled out.
- U is not in the word (from DAILY feedback, U wasn't tested, but that's fine).

Thus, ""LAUGH"" is a valid guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: L A I _ _
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, N, D, Y, U, G, H
- Still allowed letters for positions 4 and 5: B, C, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with L A I, ending with two letters from the allowed set.

Possible words:
- L A I K _ (LAIKS – not valid)
- L A I M _ (LAIM_ – not valid)
- L A I F _ (LAIF_ – not valid)
- L A I B _ (LAIB_ – not valid)
- L A I C _ (LAIC_ – ""LAIC"" is 4 letters)
- L A I P _ (LAIP_ – not valid)
- L A I V _ (LAIV_ – not valid)
- L A I B L (LAIBL – not valid)
- L A I C K (LAICK – valid word meaning ""relating to a laic"")
- L A I K Y (Y ruled out)
- L A I K S (S ruled out)

""LAICK"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""relating to a laic"" (one who does not belong to a religious order).

Check constraints:
- Starts with L A I (confirmed)
- Uses only allowed letters (C, K)
- No ruled-out letters

Thus, ""LAICK"" is the best next guess.

From the latest feedback:

- Pattern so far: L A I _ _
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, N, D, Y, U, G, H, C
- Letters confirmed in the word: L (position 1), A (position 2), I (position 3)
- Letters still allowed for positions 4 and 5: B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- From Guess 5: K is in the word but NOT in position 5 (K(-)).

So K must be in position 4, and the final letter must be from the remaining allowed set.

Possible words:
- L A I K _
  - LAIKB – invalid
  - LAIKF – invalid
  - LAIKM – invalid
  - LAIKP – invalid
  - LAIKV – invalid
  - LAIKZ – invalid
  - LAIKY – Y ruled out
  - LAIKS – S ruled out
  - LAIKQ – invalid
  - LAIKJ – invalid

Looking at valid English words, ""LAIK"" is a root but we need 5 letters. The only valid word seems to be ""LAIKO"" but O is ruled out.

Wait, let's check if ""LAIK"" can form a word with an allowed letter. The only possible is ""LAIK_"" where _ is from B, F, M, P, V, Z.

""LAIKV"" – not a word.
""LAIKP"" – not a word.
""LAIKM"" – not a word.
""LAIKB"" – not a word.
""LAIKF"" – not a word.
""LAIKZ"" – not a word.

Hmm, seems like no valid words. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let's think differently: maybe K is in position 4 and the last letter is from remaining allowed set. The only valid word I can think is ""LAIKO"" but O is ruled out.

Wait, let me check ""LAIF"" – no, F is allowed but ""LAIF"" is not a word.

""LAIV"" – no.
