### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 of the top 5 most frequent letters (A, R, E)
3. It has good vowel coverage (A, O, E)
4. It doesn't have any repeating letters

This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 of the top 5 most frequent letters (A, R, E)
3. It has good vowel coverage (A, O, E)
4. It doesn't have any repeating letters

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, L, T
- Positions S and E cannot be: S ≠ 1,4 and E ≠ 5

Next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Try to place S and E in valid positions.
3. Introduce new common letters (avoiding R, O, L, T).

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is A), so 2 or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is A), so 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try:
- If S is in position 2, E could be in 1 or 4.
- If S is in position 5, E could be in 1 or 2.

Common words fitting _ _ A _ _:
- If S in 2, E in 1: E S A _ _
- If S in 2, E in 4: _ S A E _
- If S in 5, E in 1: E _ A _ S
- If S in 5, E in 2: _ E A _ S

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- E S A _ _ : No common words.
- _ S A E _ : Possible ""BASE"" but we don’t know about B yet.
- E _ A _ S : Possible ""EARLS"" but L is excluded.
- _ E A _ S : Possible ""HEAPS"" but P is new and H is new.

Let’s try ""HEAPS"":
- H, E, A, P, S
- Uses E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), A in 3 (correct), introduces H and P which are new and common.

Another option is ""PEACH"" but C is new and H is new, and positions fit:
- P E A C H
- E in 2, S not used here – but we need to use S since it’s confirmed.

Better to use S. Let’s try ""PEASH"" but that’s not a valid word.
""BEAST"" uses B, E, A, S, T – but T is excluded.
""FEAST"" uses F, E, A, S, T – T excluded.
""NEASH"" not a word.
""WEASE"" not a word.
""BEADS"" uses B, E, A, D, S – all allowed letters, positions:
- B E A D S
- E in 2, S in 5, A in 3 – fits all constraints.

""BEADS"" seems valid and uses new common letters B and D.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 of the top 5 most frequent letters (A, R, E)
3. It has good vowel coverage (A, O, E)
4. It doesn't have any repeating letters

This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
Letters NOT in the word: R, O  
Letters IN the word (but positions unknown): A, S, E

Next guess should:
1. Use A, S, E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoid R and O.
3. Try new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates: SLATE, SAUCE, STEAK, SCALE, etc.
- SLATE: uses S, L, A, T, E – all new letters except A, S, E which we know are in the word.
- SCALE: uses S, C, A, L, E – same idea.

Between these, SLATE introduces L and T, which are common. SCALE introduces C and L. SLATE seems slightly better for letter coverage.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (arose):
A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 1
R(x) → R is NOT in the word
O(x) → O is NOT in the word
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5

Round 2 (slate):
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 1
L(x) → L is NOT in the word
A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 3
T(x) → T is NOT in the word
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, L, T
- Positions S and E cannot be: S ≠ 1,4 and E ≠ 5

Next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Try to place S and E in valid positions.
3. Introduce new common letters (avoiding R, O, L, T).

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is A), so 2 or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is A), so 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try:
- If S is in position 2, E could be in 1 or 4.
- If S is in position 5, E could be in 1 or 2.

Common words fitting _ _ A _ _:
- If S in 2, E in 1: E S A _ _
- If S in 2, E in 4: _ S A E _
- If S in 5, E in 1: E _ A _ S
- If S in 5, E in 2: _ E A _ S

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- E S A _ _ : No common words.
- _ S A E _ : Possible ""BASE"" but we don’t know about B yet.
- E _ A _ S : Possible ""EARLS"" but L is excluded.
- _ E A _ S : Possible ""HEAPS"" but P is new and H is new.

Let’s try ""HEAPS"":
- H, E, A, P, S
- Uses E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), A in 3 (correct), introduces H and P which are new and common.

Another option is ""PEACH"" but C is new and H is new, and positions fit:
- P E A C H
- E in 2, S not used here – but we need to use S since it’s confirmed.

Better to use S. Let’s try ""PEASH"" but that’s not a valid word.
""BEAST"" uses B, E, A, S, T – but T is excluded.
""FEAST"" uses F, E, A, S, T – T excluded.
""NEASH"" not a word.
""WEASE"" not a word.
""BEADS"" uses B, E, A, D, S – all allowed letters, positions:
- B E A D S
- E in 2, S in 5, A in 3 – fits all constraints.

""BEADS"" seems valid and uses new common letters B and D.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: _ E A _ S
- Letters in correct positions: E (2), A (3), S (5)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, L, T, B, D, M, N
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4: C, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that fits:
1st letter: any of C, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y  
4th letter: any of C, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y

- C E A R S → ""CEARS"" (invalid, R excluded)
- F E A R S → ""FARSE"" (invalid)

- V E A P S → ""VEAPS"" (invalid)
- W E A P S → ""WEAPS"" (invalid)
- C E A K S → ""CEAKS"" (invalid)

The only valid remaining word seems to be ""PEAKS,"" but we've already guessed it. Since no other common word fits, we must consider ""CEAPS"" or similar, but they aren't valid.

Rechecking valid English words: ""HEAPS"" uses H, E, A, P, S – all allowed letters (H and P are new, E, A, S confirmed). ""HEAPS"" fits the pattern _ E A _ S with H in 1 and P in 4.
