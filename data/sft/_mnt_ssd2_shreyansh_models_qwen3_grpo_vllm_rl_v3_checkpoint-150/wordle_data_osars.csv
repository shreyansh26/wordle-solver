For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ADIEU"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).

- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).

- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, S but NOT E.
- A is not in position 1, R not in 2, O not in 3, S not in 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, O, S plus one more letter (not E), and respects the position constraints. Possible candidates: ""SWORD"", ""RAISE"" (but E is out), ""ROAST"" (but S is in 4th, which is invalid), ""SARON"", etc. ""SWORD"" uses S, W, O, R, D and respects the constraints: S is in 1st (allowed), W is new, O is in 3rd (allowed since original was 3rd but marked wrong), R is in 4th (allowed since original was 2nd), D is new. Let me check: A is not in ""SWORD"", but A must be present somewhere - oops, that's a problem. I need to include A, R, O, S but not E.

Better candidate: ""RASPY"" - but P and Y are new, and A is 2nd (allowed), R is 1st (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), O is missing - no good.

""ROAST"" - but S is 4th (invalid per feedback).

""SAOR_"" - but not a valid word.

""SORRY"" - but R is 4th (allowed), S is 1st (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), but Y is new, and we need 5 letters. Also, two R's might not fit.

""ARSON"" - A is 1st (invalid), but A must not be 1st.

""RATIO"" - but O is 5th (allowed), A is 2nd (allowed), R is 1st (allowed), I is new, T is new. This uses A, R, O but not S - missing S.

""STORM"" - S is 1st (allowed), T is new, O is 3rd (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), M is new. This uses S, O, R but not A - missing A.

""RAILS"" - but O is missing.

""CAROS"" - but C is new, A is 2nd (allowed), R is 3rd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed), S is 5th (allowed). This uses A, R, O, S and respects positions: A not 1st, R not 2nd, O not 3rd, S not 4th. This seems valid.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)

Key deductions:

2. Letter that is NOT in the word: E (from Guess 1) and C (from Guess 2).
3. Position information:
   - S is confirmed in the 5th position (from Guess 2: S(✓)).
   - A is not in positions 1 or 2.
   - R is not in positions 2 or 3.
   - O is not in positions 3 or 4.

So the pattern so far: _ _ _ _ S, with the remaining letters A, R, O placed in the first four slots without violating the positional bans.

- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → must be 1st or 4th.
- O cannot be 3rd or 4th → must be 1st or 2nd.

Let’s try to fit A, R, O into the first four positions:
- If O is 1st, then R must be 1st or 4th, but 1st is taken by O → R must be 4th. Then A must be 3rd (only remaining spot). That gives O R _ A S → OR_A_S → ORA_S won’t form a word; ORAAS isn’t valid.
- If O is 2nd, then R can be 1st or 4th. A must be 3rd or 4th.
  - R 1st, A 3rd: R O A _ S → ROA_S → ROAST (but S is 5th, so ROAST is valid).
  - R 1st, A 4th: R O _ A S → R O _ A S → R O W A S (no common word).
  - A 1st is banned, so only viable is R O A _ S → ROAST.

ROAST is a valid 5-letter word, uses all required letters (A, R, O, S) and respects the constraints:

- A is 3rd (allowed, not 1st or 2nd).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ADIEU"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, S but NOT E.
- A is not in position 1, R not in 2, O not in 3, S not in 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, O, S plus one more letter (not E), and respects the position constraints. Possible candidates: ""SWORD"", ""RAISE"" (but E is out), ""ROAST"" (but S is in 4th, which is invalid), ""SARON"", etc. ""SWORD"" uses S, W, O, R, D and respects the constraints: S is in 1st (allowed), W is new, O is in 3rd (allowed since original was 3rd but marked wrong), R is in 4th (allowed since original was 2nd), D is new. Let me check: A is not in ""SWORD"", but A must be present somewhere - oops, that's a problem. I need to include A, R, O, S but not E.

Better candidate: ""RASPY"" - but P and Y are new, and A is 2nd (allowed), R is 1st (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), O is missing - no good.

""ROAST"" - but S is 4th (invalid per feedback).

""SAOR_"" - but not a valid word.

""SORRY"" - but R is 4th (allowed), S is 1st (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), but Y is new, and we need 5 letters. Also, two R's might not fit.

""ARSON"" - A is 1st (invalid), but A must not be 1st.

""RATIO"" - but O is 5th (allowed), A is 2nd (allowed), R is 1st (allowed), I is new, T is new. This uses A, R, O but not S - missing S.

""STORM"" - S is 1st (allowed), T is new, O is 3rd (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), M is new. This uses S, O, R but not A - missing A.

""RAILS"" - but O is missing.

""CAROS"" - but C is new, A is 2nd (allowed), R is 3rd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed), S is 5th (allowed). This uses A, R, O, S and respects positions: A not 1st, R not 2nd, O not 3rd, S not 4th. This seems valid.

""CAROS"" is a valid 5-letter word (a variant of ""carat"" or a historical coin). It includes all required letters and respects the position constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CAROS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(-) O(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CAROS → C(x) A(-) R(-) O(-) S(✓)

Key deductions:
1. Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, O, S (all marked “-” or “✓”).
2. Letter that is NOT in the word: E (from Guess 1) and C (from Guess 2).
3. Position information:
   - S is confirmed in the 5th position (from Guess 2: S(✓)).
   - A is not in positions 1 or 2.
   - R is not in positions 2 or 3.
   - O is not in positions 3 or 4.

So the pattern so far: _ _ _ _ S, with the remaining letters A, R, O placed in the first four slots without violating the positional bans.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st or 2nd → must be 3rd or 4th.
- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → must be 1st or 4th.
- O cannot be 3rd or 4th → must be 1st or 2nd.

Let’s try to fit A, R, O into the first four positions:
- If O is 1st, then R must be 1st or 4th, but 1st is taken by O → R must be 4th. Then A must be 3rd (only remaining spot). That gives O R _ A S → OR_A_S → ORA_S won’t form a word; ORAAS isn’t valid.
- If O is 2nd, then R can be 1st or 4th. A must be 3rd or 4th.
  - R 1st, A 3rd: R O A _ S → ROA_S → ROAST (but S is 5th, so ROAST is valid).
  - R 1st, A 4th: R O _ A S → R O _ A S → R O W A S (no common word).
  - A 1st is banned, so only viable is R O A _ S → ROAST.

ROAST is a valid 5-letter word, uses all required letters (A, R, O, S) and respects the constraints:
- S is 5th (✓).
- A is 3rd (allowed, not 1st or 2nd).
- R is 1st (allowed, not 2nd or 3rd).
- O is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd or 4th).

No banned letters (C, E) are used.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word: A, R, O, S  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: C, E, T

- O is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ADIEU"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, S but NOT E.
- A is not in position 1, R not in 2, O not in 3, S not in 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, O, S plus one more letter (not E), and respects the position constraints. Possible candidates: ""SWORD"", ""RAISE"" (but E is out), ""ROAST"" (but S is in 4th, which is invalid), ""SARON"", etc. ""SWORD"" uses S, W, O, R, D and respects the constraints: S is in 1st (allowed), W is new, O is in 3rd (allowed since original was 3rd but marked wrong), R is in 4th (allowed since original was 2nd), D is new. Let me check: A is not in ""SWORD"", but A must be present somewhere - oops, that's a problem. I need to include A, R, O, S but not E.

Better candidate: ""RASPY"" - but P and Y are new, and A is 2nd (allowed), R is 1st (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), O is missing - no good.

""ROAST"" - but S is 4th (invalid per feedback).

""SAOR_"" - but not a valid word.

""SORRY"" - but R is 4th (allowed), S is 1st (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), but Y is new, and we need 5 letters. Also, two R's might not fit.

""ARSON"" - A is 1st (invalid), but A must not be 1st.

""RATIO"" - but O is 5th (allowed), A is 2nd (allowed), R is 1st (allowed), I is new, T is new. This uses A, R, O but not S - missing S.

""STORM"" - S is 1st (allowed), T is new, O is 3rd (allowed), R is 4th (allowed), M is new. This uses S, O, R but not A - missing A.

""RAILS"" - but O is missing.

""CAROS"" - but C is new, A is 2nd (allowed), R is 3rd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed), S is 5th (allowed). This uses A, R, O, S and respects positions: A not 1st, R not 2nd, O not 3rd, S not 4th. This seems valid.

""CAROS"" is a valid 5-letter word (a variant of ""carat"" or a historical coin). It includes all required letters and respects the position constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CAROS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(-) O(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CAROS → C(x) A(-) R(-) O(-) S(✓)

Key deductions:
1. Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, O, S (all marked “-” or “✓”).
2. Letter that is NOT in the word: E (from Guess 1) and C (from Guess 2).
3. Position information:
   - S is confirmed in the 5th position (from Guess 2: S(✓)).
   - A is not in positions 1 or 2.
   - R is not in positions 2 or 3.
   - O is not in positions 3 or 4.

So the pattern so far: _ _ _ _ S, with the remaining letters A, R, O placed in the first four slots without violating the positional bans.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st or 2nd → must be 3rd or 4th.
- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → must be 1st or 4th.
- O cannot be 3rd or 4th → must be 1st or 2nd.

Let’s try to fit A, R, O into the first four positions:
- If O is 1st, then R must be 1st or 4th, but 1st is taken by O → R must be 4th. Then A must be 3rd (only remaining spot). That gives O R _ A S → OR_A_S → ORA_S won’t form a word; ORAAS isn’t valid.
- If O is 2nd, then R can be 1st or 4th. A must be 3rd or 4th.
  - R 1st, A 3rd: R O A _ S → ROA_S → ROAST (but S is 5th, so ROAST is valid).
  - R 1st, A 4th: R O _ A S → R O _ A S → R O W A S (no common word).
  - A 1st is banned, so only viable is R O A _ S → ROAST.

ROAST is a valid 5-letter word, uses all required letters (A, R, O, S) and respects the constraints:
- S is 5th (✓).
- A is 3rd (allowed, not 1st or 2nd).
- R is 1st (allowed, not 2nd or 3rd).
- O is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd or 4th).

No banned letters (C, E) are used.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word: A, R, O, S  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: C, E, T  

Positional constraints (from the “-” marks):
- A is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 → must be in position 3.
- R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4.
- O is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 1.
- S is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → must be in position 2.

So the only possible arrangement is:
O  S  A  R  _

We still need one more letter (position 5) that is:
- not any of C, E, T (already excluded),
- not any of A, R, O, S (they are already placed).

Available letters (common ones): D, N, L, M, P, etc.

Try the most common ending: “OSAR_”  
Valid 5-letter words ending in a consonant:  
- OSARS?  (no)  
- OSARY?  (Y is possible)  
- OSARD?  (D is possible)  

“OSARD” is a valid word (an old coin/weight unit).  
“OSARY” is not standard.

So we guess OSARD.

We now know the first four letters are O S A R and the fifth letter is NOT D or Y (and we already knew it wasn’t C, E, or T).

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form OSAR_.  
Checking common English words:

- OSARB – no  
- OSARF – no  
- OSARG – no  
- OSARH – no

- OSARL – no  
- OSARM – no  
- OSARN – no  
- OSARP – no  
- OSARU – no  
- OSARV – no  
- OSARW – no  

The only real word that fits is “OSARS”, but that would duplicate the letter S (already in position 2).  
However, “OSARS” is actually a valid word (a plural form of “osar”, though rare), but most word lists accept “OSARS”.

Given the constraints, “OSARS” is the only possible remaining guess.
