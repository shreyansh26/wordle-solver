For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (since S was in position 4 in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (not in position 4).
- Excludes A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""UNTIL"" because:
- It has S (in position 5) which satisfies the feedback.
- It uses new letters U, N, T, I, L which haven't been tested yet.
- It follows the constraint of excluding A, R, O, E.

Wait, ""UNTIL"" doesn't have S. Let me rethink.

We need a word with S and without A,R,O,E. Let's try ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- Uses new letters T, I, N, G.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(-) G(x)

   – T, I, G are not in the word.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

- Does not contain A, R, O, E, T, I, G.
- S is not in position 1 or 4.
- N is not in position 4.

Remaining common letters to work with: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S and N in valid spots. A good candidate is “SN” + three other allowed consonants/vowels.

One strong candidate is “SNUNK”:
- Contains S and N.
- Uses only allowed letters (U, K).
- S is in position 1 – but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback). So “SNUNK” is invalid.

Another candidate: “SHUNS”:
- S in position 5 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses H, U (both allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

“SHUNS” seems valid.

But let’s double-check:
- S not in 1 or 4 → position 5 is OK.
- N not in 4 → position 3 is OK.
- Letters used: S, H, U, N, S – all allowed.

So “SHUNS” is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback:

- S(-) : S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- H(x) : H is NOT in the word.
- U(x) : U is NOT in the word.
- N(-) : N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- S(✓) : S is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with S (position 5).
2. It contains N, but N is NOT in position 4.
3. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, T, I, G, H, U.
4. Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus N and S (with S fixed at position 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains N somewhere in positions 1-3 (since position 4 is forbidden for N).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to construct such a word. Possible patterns:
- N _ _ _ S (but N cannot be in position 4, so this is OK)
- _ N _ _ S
- _ _ N _ S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (since S was in position 4 in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (not in position 4).
- Excludes A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""UNTIL"" because:
- It has S (in position 5) which satisfies the feedback.
- It uses new letters U, N, T, I, L which haven't been tested yet.
- It follows the constraint of excluding A, R, O, E.

Wait, ""UNTIL"" doesn't have S. Let me rethink.

We need a word with S and without A,R,O,E. Let's try ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- Uses new letters T, I, N, G.
- Excludes A,R,O,E.

""STING"" seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(-) G(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – T, I, G are not in the word.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, G.

Letters we know ARE in the word (positions still unknown): S, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and N.
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, T, I, G.
- S is not in position 1 or 4.
- N is not in position 4.

Remaining common letters to work with: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S and N in valid spots. A good candidate is “SN” + three other allowed consonants/vowels.

One strong candidate is “SNUNK”:
- Contains S and N.
- Uses only allowed letters (U, K).
- S is in position 1 – but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback). So “SNUNK” is invalid.

Another candidate: “SHUNS”:
- S in position 5 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses H, U (both allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

“SHUNS” seems valid.

But let’s double-check:
- S not in 1 or 4 → position 5 is OK.
- N not in 4 → position 3 is OK.
- Letters used: S, H, U, N, S – all allowed.

So “SHUNS” is a valid next guess.

Let’s list everything we know after three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, G, H, U

Letters that **are** in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions:  
S, N

From the feedback:

- S was in position 4 in AROSE → S is not in position 4.  
- S was in position 1 in STING → S is not in position 1.  
- S was in position 1 in SHUNS → S is not in position 1 (repeated).  
- S was in position 5 in SHUNS → S is in the word **and** is in position 5.  
  Therefore, the final position of S is fixed: position 5.

- N was in position 4 in STING → N is not in position 4.  
- N was in position 4 in SHUNS → N is not in position 4 (repeated).  
  So N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ _ _ S  
with N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus N and S (S already placed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing N in positions 1-3, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- N _ _ _ S: NELFS, NELMS, NELPS, NELVS, NELWS, NELYS (but must be valid words).  
- _ N _ _ S: BN_ _S, CN_ _S, etc.

Valid English words fitting the pattern:  
- NELFS – not a word.  
- NELMS – not a word.  
- NELPS – not a word.  
- NELVS – not a word.  
- NELWS – not a word.  
- NELYS – not a word.  

- N _ _ _ S:  
  - NINJS – not valid.  
  - NINOS – contains O (forbidden).  
  - NIPPS – valid? NIPPS is a plural of nip, but obscure.  
  - NIVVS – not valid.  
  - NINIS – contains I (forbidden).  

- _ N _ _ S:  
  - B N _ _S: BNASS – invalid.  
  - C N _ _S: CN_ _S – no common words.  
  - D N _ _S: DN_ _S – no.  
  - F N _ _S: FN_ _S – no.  
  - L N _ _S: LN_ _S – no.  
  - M N _ _S: MN_ _S – no.  
  - P N _ _S: PN_ _S – no.  
  - V N _ _S: VN_ _S – no.  
  - W N _ _S: WN_ _S – no.  

Wait, let’s try N in position 2:  
- _ N _ _ S:  
  - DN_ _S: DNASS – invalid.  
  - FN_ _S: FNASS – invalid.  
  - LN_ _S: LNASS – invalid.  
  - MN_ _S: MNASS – invalid.  
  - PN_ _S: PNASS – invalid.  

N in position 3:  
- _ _ N _ S:  
  - DN_ NS: DNANS – invalid.  
  - FN_ NS: FNANS – invalid.  
  - LN_ NS: LNANS – invalid.  
  - MN_ NS: MNANS – invalid.  
  - PN_ NS: PNANS – invalid.  

N in position 1:  
- N _ _ _ S:  
  - NELFS – invalid.  
  - NELMS – invalid.  
  - NELPS – invalid.  
  - NELVS – invalid.  
  - NELWS – invalid.  
  - NELYS – invalid.  
  - NINJS – invalid.  
  - NIPPS – valid (though rare).  

The only valid word fitting all constraints is **NIPPS**.

However, ""NIPPS"" is quite obscure. Let me double-check for other possibilities.

Another candidate: **NINJS** – invalid.  
**NINIS** – invalid (contains I).  
**NELFS** – invalid.  

It appears **NIPPS** is the only valid word left that ends with S, contains N in position 1 (allowed), and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is **NIPPS**.
</think>

<guess>NIPPS</guess>",NIPPS,"Let’s list everything we know after three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, G, H, U

Letters that **are** in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions:

From the feedback:

- S was in position 4 in AROSE → S is not in position 4.  
- S was in position 1 in STING → S is not in position 1.  
- S was in position 1 in SHUNS → S is not in position 1 (repeated).  
- S was in position 5 in SHUNS → S is in the word **and** is in position 5.  
  Therefore, the final position of S is fixed: position 5.

- N was in position 4 in STING → N is not in position 4.  
- N was in position 4 in SHUNS → N is not in position 4 (repeated).  
  So N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ _ _ S  
with N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus N and S (S already placed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing N in positions 1-3, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- N _ _ _ S: NELFS, NELMS, NELPS, NELVS, NELWS, NELYS (but must be valid words).  
- _ N _ _ S: BN_ _S, CN_ _S, etc.

  - NINOS – contains O (forbidden).  
  - NIPPS – valid? NIPPS is a plural of nip, but obscure.

  - P N _ _S: PN_ _S – no.  
  - V N _ _S: VN_ _S – no.  
  - W N _ _S: WN_ _S – no.  

Wait, let’s try N in position 2:  
- _ N _ _ S:  
  - DN_ _S: DNASS – invalid.  
  - FN_ _S: FNASS – invalid.  
  - LN_ _S: LNASS – invalid.  
  - MN_ _S: MNASS – invalid.  
  - PN_ _S: PNASS – invalid.  

N in position 3:

  - FN_ NS: FNANS – invalid.  
  - LN_ NS: LNANS – invalid.  
  - MN_ NS: MNANS – invalid.  
  - PN_ NS: PNANS – invalid.  

N in position 1:

  - NELPS – invalid.  
  - NELVS – invalid.  
  - NELWS – invalid.  
  - NELYS – invalid.  
  - NINJS – invalid.  
  - NIPPS – valid (though rare).  

The only valid word fitting all constraints is **NIPPS**.

However, ""NIPPS"" is quite obscure. Let me double-check for other possibilities.

Another candidate: **NINJS** – invalid.  
**NINIS** – invalid (contains I).  
**NELFS** – invalid.  

It appears **NIPPS** is the only valid word left that ends with S, contains N in position 1 (allowed), and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is **NIPPS**.",Guess 5: NIPPS -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) P(x) P(x) S(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (since S was in position 4 in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (not in position 4).
- Excludes A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""UNTIL"" because:
- It has S (in position 5) which satisfies the feedback.
- It uses new letters U, N, T, I, L which haven't been tested yet.
- It follows the constraint of excluding A, R, O, E.

Wait, ""UNTIL"" doesn't have S. Let me rethink.

We need a word with S and without A,R,O,E. Let's try ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- Uses new letters T, I, N, G.
- Excludes A,R,O,E.

""STING"" seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(-) G(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – T, I, G are not in the word.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, G.

Letters we know ARE in the word (positions still unknown): S, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and N.
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, T, I, G.
- S is not in position 1 or 4.
- N is not in position 4.

Remaining common letters to work with: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S and N in valid spots. A good candidate is “SN” + three other allowed consonants/vowels.

One strong candidate is “SNUNK”:
- Contains S and N.
- Uses only allowed letters (U, K).
- S is in position 1 – but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback). So “SNUNK” is invalid.

Another candidate: “SHUNS”:
- S in position 5 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses H, U (both allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

“SHUNS” seems valid.

But let’s double-check:
- S not in 1 or 4 → position 5 is OK.
- N not in 4 → position 3 is OK.
- Letters used: S, H, U, N, S – all allowed.

So “SHUNS” is a valid next guess.

Let’s list everything we know after three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, G, H, U

Letters that **are** in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions:  
S, N

From the feedback:

- S was in position 4 in AROSE → S is not in position 4.  
- S was in position 1 in STING → S is not in position 1.  
- S was in position 1 in SHUNS → S is not in position 1 (repeated).  
- S was in position 5 in SHUNS → S is in the word **and** is in position 5.  
  Therefore, the final position of S is fixed: position 5.

- N was in position 4 in STING → N is not in position 4.  
- N was in position 4 in SHUNS → N is not in position 4 (repeated).  
  So N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ _ _ S  
with N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus N and S (S already placed).

From the feedback on NIPPS:

- N is in the word but not in position 1.  
- I, P are not in the word.  
- S is confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S (position 5).  
- Contains N, but N is NOT in position 1, 4, or 5.  
  Therefore N must be in position 2 or 3.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, I, G, H, U, P.  
  Allowed remaining letters: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus N and S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with N in position 2 or 3, and only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. _ N _ _ S  
2. _ _ N _ S  

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns:

Pattern 1 (_ N _ _ S):
- B N _ _ S: BNASS – invalid.  
- C N _ _ S: CNASS – invalid.  
- D N _ _ S: DNASS – invalid.  
- F N _ _ S: FNASS – invalid.  
- L N _ _ S: LNASS – invalid.  
- M N _ _ S: MNASS – invalid.  
- V N _ _ S: VNASS – invalid.  
- W N _ _ S: WNASS – invalid.

  - BANNS – contains A (forbidden).  
  - BUNNS – contains U (forbidden).  
- C _ N _ S:  
  - CANNY – ends Y, not S.  
  - CINCS – contains I (forbidden).  
- D _ N _ S:  
  - DUNNS – valid (Scottish for “a dun”).  
- F _ N _ S:  
  - FANNY – ends Y.  
- L _ N _ S:  
  - LANNS – invalid.  
- M _ N _ S:  
  - MANNS – invalid.  
- V _ N _ S:  
  - VANNY – ends Y.  

The only valid word left is **DUNNS**.

Check constraints:
- Ends with S (position 5) – ✓  
- Contains N in position 3 – ✓  
- No forbidden letters – ✓  

Therefore, the next guess is **DUNNS**.

- N is in the word but not in position 1.  
- I, P are not in the word.  
- S is confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S (position 5).  
- Contains N, but N is NOT in position 1, 4, or 5.  
  Therefore N must be in position 2 or 3.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, I, G, H, U, P.  
  Allowed remaining letters: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus N and S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with N in position 2 or 3, and only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. _ N _ _ S  
2. _ _ N _ S  

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns:

Pattern 1 (_ N _ _ S):
- B N _ _ S: BNASS – invalid.  
- C N _ _ S: CNASS – invalid.  
- D N _ _ S: DNASS – invalid.  
- F N _ _ S: FNASS – invalid.  
- L N _ _ S: LNASS – invalid.  
- M N _ _ S: MNASS – invalid.  
- V N _ _ S: VNASS – invalid.  
- W N _ _ S: WNASS – invalid.  

Pattern 2 (_ _ N _ S):
- B _ N _ S:  
  - BANNS – contains A (forbidden).  
  - BUNNS – contains U (forbidden).  
- C _ N _ S:  
  - CANNY – ends Y, not S.  
  - CINCS – contains I (forbidden).  
- D _ N _ S:  
  - DUNNS – valid (Scottish for “a dun”).  
- F _ N _ S:  
  - FANNY – ends Y.  
- L _ N _ S:  
  - LANNS – invalid.  
- M _ N _ S:  
  - MANNS – invalid.  
- V _ N _ S:  
  - VANNY – ends Y.  

The only valid word left is **DUNNS**.

Check constraints:
- Ends with S (position 5) – ✓  
- Contains N in position 3 – ✓  
- No forbidden letters – ✓  

Therefore, the next guess is **DUNNS**.",Guess 6: DUNNS -> FEEDBACK: D(-) U(x) N(✓) N(-) S(✓),FAIL
