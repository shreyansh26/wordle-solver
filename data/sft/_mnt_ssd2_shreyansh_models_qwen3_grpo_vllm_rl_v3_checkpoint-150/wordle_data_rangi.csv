### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

1. Uses A (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

2. Letters confirmed IN the word: R (position 1), A (position 2), I (somewhere).
3. A is already in position 2, so it won’t appear elsewhere.
4. I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:

- I must appear in position 3 or 5.
- Allowed letters left (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- R A I N Y: positions 1-5.
- I is in position 3 here, which is allowed since I can be in 3 or 5.

Another is R A M I C → RAMIC (not a word). \n\nLooking at common words: R A I N Y (but N and Y are allowed), R A I S E (but S and E are eliminated), R A I N Y seems best. \n\nWait, R A I N Y uses N and Y, which are allowed.

R A N K S → S eliminated. \n\nR A N C H → RANCH (valid). RANCH uses C and H, both allowed, and I is in position 4 (but I can’t be in 4). \n\nR A N C H → I is in position 4 → invalid. \n\nR A N K S → S eliminated. \n\nR A N G E → E eliminated. \n\nR A N C Y → C and Y allowed, but I must be present. \n\nR A N C Y doesn’t have I. \n\nR A I N Y → I in 3, N and Y allowed.

The feedback says: “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means the word “RAIN Y” (with a space) is invalid because Wordle answers are always five letters without spaces.  
I need to guess a single 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R
- Has A in position 2
- Contains I somewhere (but not in position 4)
- Avoids S, L, T, E, D, O

So the pattern is: R A _ _ _
Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
And I must appear once in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s test R A I _ _: R A I N Y (invalid due to space).  
Instead, R A I N Y → RAIN Y was rejected, so I should try R A I N Y without the space: R A I N Y → R A I N Y is six letters with space.  
Actually, the correct 5-letter word fitting R A I _ _ is R A I N S → but S is eliminated.  
R A I N C → not a word.  
R A I N K → not a word.  
R A I N G → R A I N G is six letters.  

Let’s try R A _ I _: R A M I C → not a word.  
R A N I C → not a word.  
R A P I N → not a word.  
R A B I N → R A B I N → RABIN (valid, a name, but not common).  

R A C I N → not a word.  
R A G I N → not a word.  

R A _ _ I: R A N C I → not a word.  
R A N K I → not a word.  

R A M I C → not a word.  

R A N G E → E eliminated.  

R A N K S → S eliminated.  

R A N C H → H allowed, but I must be present.  

R A N C H doesn’t have I.  

R A N G I → RANGI (valid word, means “sky” in Māori).  
RANGI fits: R A N G I → positions 1-5, no spaces, uses allowed letters, and includes I in position 5.  

Let’s go with RANGI.
