For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic starting word in Wordle-like games.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, S, E are **not** in the word.  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – P and O are both **correct** and in the **correct positions** (1 and 2).  
   – I, N, T are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- First two letters are **P O**.
- Remaining letters (positions 3–5) cannot be A, R, S, E, I, N, T.
- O is already used in position 2, so we don’t need another O.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: D, L, M, U, Y, etc.

A good third guess should:
- Keep P O in positions 1–2.  
- Introduce new, high-frequency letters for positions 3–5.  
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

“POUND” fits:
- P O _ _ _  
- U, N, D: N was already ruled out, so scratch that.  
Try “POWER”? E is eliminated.  
Try “POLYP”? P is already used correctly, and Y is untested but not super common.  
Try “POUND” again but N is out.  
Next: “POKED”? K and D are new, E is out.  
“POLLY”? L, Y are new, but double L is okay.  
“POLLY” keeps P O in place and tests L, Y.

But let’s pick something that tests more distinct, common letters.  
“POUND” fails on N.  
“POKED” fails on E.  
“POWER” fails on E.  
“POLYP” tests L, Y, P (but P is already fixed).  
“POUND” already fails.

Better: “POUND” is invalid (N out).  
“POKED” invalid (E out).  
“POLLY” is valid: P O L L Y. It tests L and Y in positions 3–5.

Another option: “POKED” minus E → “POKER” but E is out.  
“POUND” minus N → “POUCH”? C and H are new.  
“POUCH”:
- P O _ _ _  
- U, C, H are all new, high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, E, I, N, T) appear.

“POUCH” looks solid.

3. POUCH → P(✓) O(✓) U(x) C(-) H(x)

So the pattern is: P O _ _ _

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, H.

Letters confirmed in the word: P, O, C.

C must appear in position 3 or 5 (since position 4 is excluded).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, L, M, Y, G, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P O
- Contains C in position 3 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible options:
- P O C _ _  (C in position 3)
  - POCKS – S is out
  - POCKY – Y is new, K is new
- P O _ _ C  (C in position 5)
  - POKED – E, D are new, but E is out
  - POLYC – Y is new, L is new
  - POGIC – G is new, but I is out
  - POKYC – K, Y are new

""POCKY"" seems valid:
- P O C K Y
- C is in position 3 (allowed)
- K and Y are new, high-frequency letters
- No eliminated letters used

But let's check if ""POCKY"" is a valid word – it's a proper noun (a brand), but may not be in the dictionary.

A better choice is ""POLYC"" – but C is in position 5 here, and we know C must be in 3 or 5. ""POLYC"" is valid (short for polyclinic).

However, ""POLYC"" has C in position 5, which is allowed.

Another good option is ""POCKY"" but if that's too niche, ""POLYC"" is safer.

But ""POLYC"" uses L which is untested and C in position 5.

Actually, ""POCKY"" is more likely to be accepted as a valid guess.

But to be safe, let's go with ""POLYC"".

Wait, ""POLYC"" is 5 letters: P O L Y C.

This tests L and Y, and places C in position 5, which is allowed.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic starting word in Wordle-like games.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""POINT"":
- Contains O in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses P, I, N, T which are all common and haven't been tested yet.
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, S, E are **not** in the word.  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – P and O are both **correct** and in the **correct positions** (1 and 2).  
   – I, N, T are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- First two letters are **P O**.
- Remaining letters (positions 3–5) cannot be A, R, S, E, I, N, T.
- O is already used in position 2, so we don’t need another O.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: D, L, M, U, Y, etc.

A good third guess should:
- Keep P O in positions 1–2.  
- Introduce new, high-frequency letters for positions 3–5.  
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

“POUND” fits:
- P O _ _ _  
- U, N, D: N was already ruled out, so scratch that.  
Try “POWER”? E is eliminated.  
Try “POLYP”? P is already used correctly, and Y is untested but not super common.  
Try “POUND” again but N is out.  
Next: “POKED”? K and D are new, E is out.  
“POLLY”? L, Y are new, but double L is okay.  
“POLLY” keeps P O in place and tests L, Y.

But let’s pick something that tests more distinct, common letters.  
“POUND” fails on N.  
“POKED” fails on E.  
“POWER” fails on E.  
“POLYP” tests L, Y, P (but P is already fixed).  
“POUND” already fails.

Better: “POUND” is invalid (N out).  
“POKED” invalid (E out).  
“POLLY” is valid: P O L L Y. It tests L and Y in positions 3–5.

Another option: “POKED” minus E → “POKER” but E is out.  
“POUND” minus N → “POUCH”? C and H are new.  
“POUCH”:
- P O _ _ _  
- U, C, H are all new, high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, E, I, N, T) appear.

“POUCH” looks solid.

From the feedback:

- P and O are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from POUCH) and NOT in position 5 (from POLYC). So C must be in position 3.
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from POLYC), so Y must be in position 5.
- L is NOT in the word (from POLYC).

So the pattern is: P O C _ Y

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, H, L.

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- Has not been used yet.
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with P O C _ Y.

Possible letters for position 4 (from remaining common letters): B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, etc.

Checking possible words:
- P O C B Y – ""POCBY"" – not a valid word.
- P O C D Y – ""POCDY"" – not valid.
- P O C K Y – ""POCKY"" – valid (though proper noun, often accepted).
- P O C M Y – ""POCOMY"" – not valid.
- P O C K Y seems to be the only valid option.

Thus, ""POCKY"" is the logical next guess.
