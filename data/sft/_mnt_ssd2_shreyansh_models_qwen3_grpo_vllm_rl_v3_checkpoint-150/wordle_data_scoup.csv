### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters and their positions early on. If any of these letters are in the word, I'll get feedback that can help narrow down future guesses.

3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters and their positions early on. If any of these letters are in the word, I'll get feedback that can help narrow down future guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (from both guesses).
2. S is in the word and is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and is NOT in position 1 (from STOIC).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
   But position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I.
4. C is in the word but not in position 5 (from STOIC), so C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   Position 3 is O, so C is in 1, 2, or 4.
5. We still need to place the remaining letters: S, C, and three others that have not been used yet.

Possible remaining common letters: N, L, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has S in position 2 (since position 5 is also possible but let’s test 2).
- Has C in position 4 (since it can’t be 5).
- Uses new letters for positions 1 and 5.

A candidate: “CUSPY”
- C in 1 (allowed), U in 2 (new), S in 3 (but 3 must be O – conflict).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SCOUR”
- S in 1 (but S can’t be in 1).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SPOON”
- S in 1 (invalid).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SNOUT”
- S in 1 (invalid).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “CLOUD”
- C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, U in 4, D in 5.  
  S is missing – invalid.

Next candidate: “SCOFF”
- S in 1 (invalid).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SUGAR” – contains A and R (invalid).

Next candidate: “SUNNY” – contains N, Y; S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SLOSH”
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPOOF” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SWORD” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CLOUD” – no S.

Next candidate: “COUCH” – no S.

Next candidate: “COULD” – no S.

Next candidate: “CUPID” – no S.

Next candidate: “CYTON” – no S.

Next candidate: “DOUCY” – no S.

Next candidate: “MUCID” – no S.

Next candidate: “PUDGY” – no S.

Next candidate: “SNUCK” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPUNK” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SUSHY” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CUPID” – no S.

Next candidate: “CLOPS” – C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, P in 4, S in 5.  
  S is in 5 – allowed (S can be 2 or 5).  
  C is in 1 – allowed.  
  Letters used: C, L, O, P, S – none are ruled out.  
  This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- Position 3: O – ✓  
- S is in 5 – allowed (not in 1 or 4) – ✓  
- C is in 1 – allowed (not in 5) – ✓  
- No A, R, E, T, I – ✓  

So “CLOPS” is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

3. C is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

So far we have:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: C
- Positions 1 and 5: must be filled by P and one other unused letter (since P must be in 1 or 5).

The remaining unused common letters: N, D, U, M, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has S in position 2
- Has O in position 3
- Has C in position 4
- Has P in position 1 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible candidates:
- P _ S O C _ (position 1 = P, position 5 must be a new letter)
- _ _ S O C P (position 5 = P, position 1 must be a new letter)

Looking at the first pattern: P _ S O C _
We need a valid 5-letter word starting with P, having S in 2, O in 3, C in 4, and any letter in 5 that hasn't been ruled out.  
A valid word: PUSCO (but PUSCO isn't a common English word).

Valid word: MUSCP (invalid), DUSCP (invalid), NUSCP (invalid), YUSCP (invalid).

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be of the form:  
[1] [2=S] [3=O] [4=C] [5] with P in 1 or 5.

If P is in 1: P S O C _ (but S must be in 2, not 1) – invalid.

Wait, positions are fixed:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: C
- P must be in 1 or 5.

So possible forms:
- P _ S O C _ (but this is 6 letters) – no.

Actually, the word structure is:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: S
Position 3: O
Position 4: C
Position 5: ?

And P must be in position 1 or 5.

So possible words:
- P S O C _ (position 1 = P, position 5 = ?) – but this is 5 letters: P S O C ?
- _ S O C P (position 5 = P, position 1 = ?)

Looking at _ S O C P: we need a valid 5-letter word ending in P with S in 2, O in 3, C in 4.  
Valid word: MUSCP (invalid), DUSCP (invalid), NUSCP (invalid), YUSCP (invalid).

Looking at P S O C _: we need a valid 5-letter word starting with P, having S in 2, O in 3, C in 4, and any letter in 5.  
Valid word: PUSCO (valid, though uncommon), or maybe PISCO (a type of wine).

""PISCO"" is a valid 5-letter word (a brand of wine). Let's check:
- Position 1: P (allowed)
- Position 2: S (required)
- Position 3: O (required)
- Position 4: C (required)
- Position 5: S (not ruled out, and PISCO is valid)

But wait, PISCO has S in position 5, which is allowed (S can be in 2 or 5).  
And P is in position 1, which is allowed.

Let's verify no ruled-out letters: A, R, E, T, I, L – none appear in PISCO.

Thus, PISCO is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters and their positions early on. If any of these letters are in the word, I'll get feedback that can help narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Does not contain A, R, or E.

  S is in 5 – allowed (S can be 2 or 5).  
  C is in 1 – allowed.  
  Letters used: C, L, O, P, S – none are ruled out.

- S is in 5 – allowed (not in 1 or 4) – ✓

5. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I, L.

So far we have:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: C
- Positions 1 and 5: must be filled by P and one other unused letter (since P must be in 1 or 5).

The remaining unused common letters: N, D, U, M, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has S in position 2
- Has O in position 3
- Has C in position 4
- Has P in position 1 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible candidates:
- P _ S O C _ (position 1 = P, position 5 must be a new letter)
- _ _ S O C P (position 5 = P, position 1 must be a new letter)

Looking at the first pattern: P _ S O C _
We need a valid 5-letter word starting with P, having S in 2, O in 3, C in 4, and any letter in 5 that hasn't been ruled out.  
A valid word: PUSCO (but PUSCO isn't a common English word).

Second pattern: _ _ S O C P  
We need a valid 5-letter word ending in P, with S in 2, O in 3, C in 4.  
Valid word: MUSCP (invalid), DUSCP (invalid), NUSCP (invalid), YUSCP (invalid).

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be of the form:  
[1] [2=S] [3=O] [4=C] [5] with P in 1 or 5.

If P is in 1: P S O C _ (but S must be in 2, not 1) – invalid.

Wait, positions are fixed:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: C
- P must be in 1 or 5.

So possible forms:
- P _ S O C _ (but this is 6 letters) – no.

Actually, the word structure is:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: S
Position 3: O
Position 4: C
Position 5: ?

And P must be in position 1 or 5.

So possible words:
- P S O C _ (position 1 = P, position 5 = ?) – but this is 5 letters: P S O C ?
- _ S O C P (position 5 = P, position 1 = ?)

Looking at _ S O C P: we need a valid 5-letter word ending in P with S in 2, O in 3, C in 4.  
Valid word: MUSCP (invalid), DUSCP (invalid), NUSCP (invalid), YUSCP (invalid).

Looking at P S O C _: we need a valid 5-letter word starting with P, having S in 2, O in 3, C in 4, and any letter in 5.  
Valid word: PUSCO (valid, though uncommon), or maybe PISCO (a type of wine).

""PISCO"" is a valid 5-letter word (a brand of wine). Let's check:
- Position 1: P (allowed)
- Position 2: S (required)
- Position 3: O (required)
- Position 4: C (required)
- Position 5: S (not ruled out, and PISCO is valid)

But wait, PISCO has S in position 5, which is allowed (S can be in 2 or 5).  
And P is in position 1, which is allowed.

Let's verify no ruled-out letters: A, R, E, T, I, L – none appear in PISCO.

Thus, PISCO is a valid next guess.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (confirmed by every guess).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STOIC and PISCO).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from CLOPS and PISCO).  
   Therefore C must be in position 3.  
   But position 3 is already O – this is impossible.  
   Conclusion: C is NOT in the word (the feedback for CLOPS said C(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 5, and for PISCO C(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 4).  
   However, there is no position left for C that is consistent with all feedback.  
   Re-examining:

   - From CLOPS: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - From PISCO: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 4.  
   Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5.  
   Position 3 is O, position 2 is S (from point 2), so C must be in position 5.

4. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from CLOPS and PISCO).  
   Therefore P must be in position 4.

5. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I, L.

So far we have:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: C
- Position 1: ?

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: C

The only common word fitting this pattern is **USP** + **OC** – but that’s 4 letters.  
Actually, the pattern is: _ S O P C.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? S O P C.

Valid English word: **USP** + **OC** doesn’t exist.  
Wait, the word must be: [1] S O P C.

A valid 5-letter word: **USP** + **OC** – no.  
Actually, the word is **USP** + **OC** – but that’s not a word.

Wait, the pattern is: [1] [2=S] [3=O] [4=P] [5=C] – i.e., ?SOPC.

The only valid English word fitting this is **USP** + **OC** – no.

Actually, the word must be: [1] S O P C.

A valid 5-letter word: **USP** + **OC** – no.

Wait, let's think of words ending in -SP... no.

Actually, the word must be: _ S O P C.

Valid word: **USP** + **OC** – no.

Wait, let's list possible first letters: common consonants not ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for _ S O P C:

- B: BSO... no
- D: DSO... no
- F: FSO... no
- G: GSO... no
- H: HSO... no
- J: JSO... no
- K: KSO... no
- M: MSO... no
- N: NSO... no
- V: VSO... no
- W: WSO... no
- Y: YSO... no

None of these are valid.  
This suggests an inconsistency in our deductions.  
Re-examining:

From PISCO feedback: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 1.  
From CLOPS feedback: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4.  
Therefore P must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so P must be in position 5.

Similarly, C must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so C must be in position 5.  
Thus both P and C must be in position 5, which is impossible.

Conclusion: There is no valid 5-letter word that satisfies all feedback so far.  
However, since the puzzle guarantees a solution, we must have made an error.

Rechecking:

From CLOPS: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.  
From PISCO: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 4.  
Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5.  
Position 3 is O, position 2 is S, so C must be in position 5.

From PISCO: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 1.  
From CLOPS: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4.  
Possible positions for P: 2, 3, 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so P must be in position 5.

Thus both C and P must be in position 5 – impossible.

This indicates our deduction that S must be in position 2 is incorrect.  
Re-examining S:

From STOIC: S(✓) means S is in position 1.  
But from AROSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

From CLOPS: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
Thus S must be in position 1 or 2.

From PISCO: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3 (already O) or 5, so S must be in position 1 or 2.

Combining:
- Position 1: possible S or other
- Position 2: possible S or other
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

Also:
- C must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so C is in 2 or 5.
- P must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so P is in 2 or 5.

Possible cases:

Case 1: S in position 1
Then:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: C or P
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

And remaining letters must include the other (P or C) and any needed.

Case 2: S in position 2
Then:
- Position 2: S
- Position 1: ?
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

And C and P must be in 5 (but can't both be in 5).

Thus Case 1 is more promising.

Let's try Case 1: S _ O _ _
With C and P needing placement.

From CLOPS: C(-) means C is not in position 1 (ok, since position 1 is S).  
From PISCO: C(-) means C is not in position 4, so C must be in 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is not S (since S is in 1), position 3 is O, so C must be in 5.

Similarly, P must be in 2 or 5.  
Position 2 is not S (it's free), so P could be in 2 or 5.  
But C is in 5, so P must be in 2.

Thus:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: C

We need a valid 5-letter word: S P O _ C.

Possible letters for position 4 (not ruled out: not A, R, E, T, I, L).  
Common remaining letters: N, D, U, M, Y, etc.

Valid word: S P O N C – ""SPONC"" – not valid.  
S P O D C – ""SPODC"" – not valid.  
S P O U C – ""SPOUC"" – not valid.  
S P O M C – ""SPOMC"" – not valid.  
S P O Y C – ""SPYOC"" – not valid.

This suggests an inconsistency.  
Re-examining: maybe S is in position 2.

Case 2: S in position 2
Then:
- Position 2: S
- Position 1: ?
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

C and P must be in 1, 4, or 5, but:
- C cannot be in 1 or 4 (from CLOPS: C(-) means not in 1; from PISCO: C(-) means not in 4).  
  So C must be in 5.
- P cannot be in 1 or 4 (from CLOPS: P(-) means not in 4; from PISCO: P(-) means not in 1).  
  So P must be in 5.

But both C and P must be in 5 – impossible.

Thus the only consistent case is Case 1 with S in position 1, but no valid word seems to exist.  
This suggests an error in earlier deductions.

Rechecking feedback interpretation:
- AROSE: S(-) – S in word, not position 4.
- STOIC: S(✓) – S in position 1.
- CLOPS: S(-) – S in word, not position 5.
- PISCO: S(-) – S in word, not position 3.

Thus S must be in position 1.

From STOIC: S(✓) in position 1 is correct.

Thus the word must start with S, have O in 3, and contain C and P elsewhere.

With:
- C must be in 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so C is in 2 or 5.
- P must be in 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so P is in 2 or 5.

Possible:
- If C is in 2, then P must be in 5: S C O _ P
- If C is in 5, then P must be in 2: S P O _ C

For S C O _ P: position 4 must be a letter not ruled out (not A, R, E, T, I, L).  
Valid word: S C O P _ – but we need 5 letters: S C O _ P.  
Possible: S C O P Y – ""SCOPY"" – not valid.  
S C O P E – ""SCOPE"" – but E is ruled out.  
S C O P T – ""SCOPT"" – not valid.

For S P O _ C: position 4 must be a letter not ruled out.  
Valid word: S P O N C – ""SPONC"" – not valid.  
S P O K C – ""SPKOC"" – not valid.  
S P O U C – ""SPOUC"" – not valid.  
S P O D C – ""SPDLC"" – not valid.

This indicates we might have missed a word.  
Upon reflection, the word ""SCOOP"" comes to mind but has two O's.  
Let's check ""SCOOP"":
- S C O O P
- Position 1: S (✓ from STOIC)
- Position 2: C (must be in 2 or 5)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: O (allowed, not ruled out)
- Position 5: P (must be in 2 or 5, here 5)

This fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (from STOIC)
- C in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (from all guesses)
- P in position 5 (allowed)
- No A, R, E, T, I, L in the word.

""SCOOP"" is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>SCOOP</guess>
</think>

Based on all previous feedback, the only consistent pattern is:
- Position 1: S (from STOIC)
- Position 3: O (confirmed)
- C must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 1,4,5)
- P must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 1,4, and 2 is taken by C)
- Position 4 must be a letter not yet ruled out; the only remaining common letter that fits is O, forming ""SCOOP"".

<guess>SCOOP</guess>",SCOOP,"From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (confirmed by every guess).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STOIC and PISCO).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from CLOPS and PISCO).  
   Therefore C must be in position 3.  
   But position 3 is already O – this is impossible.  
   Conclusion: C is NOT in the word (the feedback for CLOPS said C(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 5, and for PISCO C(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 4).  
   However, there is no position left for C that is consistent with all feedback.

   - From CLOPS: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - From PISCO: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 4.  
   Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5.  
   Position 3 is O, position 2 is S (from point 2), so C must be in position 5.

4. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from CLOPS and PISCO).  
   Therefore P must be in position 4.

5. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I, L.

So far we have:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: C
- Position 1: ?

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: C

The only common word fitting this pattern is **USP** + **OC** – but that’s 4 letters.  
Actually, the pattern is: _ S O P C.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? S O P C.

Valid English word: **USP** + **OC** doesn’t exist.  
Wait, the word must be: [1] S O P C.

A valid 5-letter word: **USP** + **OC** – no.  
Actually, the word is **USP** + **OC** – but that’s not a word.

Wait, the pattern is: [1] [2=S] [3=O] [4=P] [5=C] – i.e., ?SOPC.

The only valid English word fitting this is **USP** + **OC** – no.

Actually, the word must be: [1] S O P C.

A valid 5-letter word: **USP** + **OC** – no.

Wait, let's think of words ending in -SP... no.

Actually, the word must be: _ S O P C.

Valid word: **USP** + **OC** – no.

Wait, let's list possible first letters: common consonants not ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for _ S O P C:

- B: BSO... no
- D: DSO... no
- F: FSO... no
- G: GSO... no
- H: HSO... no
- J: JSO... no
- K: KSO... no
- M: MSO... no
- N: NSO... no
- V: VSO... no
- W: WSO... no
- Y: YSO... no

None of these are valid.  
This suggests an inconsistency in our deductions.  
Re-examining:

From PISCO feedback: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 1.  
From CLOPS feedback: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4.  
Therefore P must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so P must be in position 5.

Similarly, C must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so C must be in position 5.  
Thus both P and C must be in position 5, which is impossible.

Conclusion: There is no valid 5-letter word that satisfies all feedback so far.  
However, since the puzzle guarantees a solution, we must have made an error.

Rechecking:

From CLOPS: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.  
From PISCO: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 4.  
Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5.  
Position 3 is O, position 2 is S, so C must be in position 5.

From PISCO: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 1.  
From CLOPS: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4.  
Possible positions for P: 2, 3, 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so P must be in position 5.

Thus both C and P must be in position 5 – impossible.

This indicates our deduction that S must be in position 2 is incorrect.  
Re-examining S:

From STOIC: S(✓) means S is in position 1.  
But from AROSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

From CLOPS: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
Thus S must be in position 1 or 2.

From PISCO: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3 (already O) or 5, so S must be in position 1 or 2.

Combining:
- Position 1: possible S or other
- Position 2: possible S or other
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

Also:
- C must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so C is in 2 or 5.
- P must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so P is in 2 or 5.

Possible cases:

Case 1: S in position 1
Then:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: C or P
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

And remaining letters must include the other (P or C) and any needed.

Case 2: S in position 2
Then:
- Position 2: S
- Position 1: ?
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

And C and P must be in 5 (but can't both be in 5).

Thus Case 1 is more promising.

Let's try Case 1: S _ O _ _
With C and P needing placement.

From CLOPS: C(-) means C is not in position 1 (ok, since position 1 is S).  
From PISCO: C(-) means C is not in position 4, so C must be in 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is not S (since S is in 1), position 3 is O, so C must be in 5.

Similarly, P must be in 2 or 5.  
Position 2 is not S (it's free), so P could be in 2 or 5.  
But C is in 5, so P must be in 2.

Thus:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: C

We need a valid 5-letter word: S P O _ C.

Possible letters for position 4 (not ruled out: not A, R, E, T, I, L).  
Common remaining letters: N, D, U, M, Y, etc.

Valid word: S P O N C – ""SPONC"" – not valid.  
S P O D C – ""SPODC"" – not valid.  
S P O U C – ""SPOUC"" – not valid.  
S P O M C – ""SPOMC"" – not valid.  
S P O Y C – ""SPYOC"" – not valid.

This suggests an inconsistency.  
Re-examining: maybe S is in position 2.

Case 2: S in position 2
Then:
- Position 2: S
- Position 1: ?
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

C and P must be in 1, 4, or 5, but:
- C cannot be in 1 or 4 (from CLOPS: C(-) means not in 1; from PISCO: C(-) means not in 4).  
  So C must be in 5.
- P cannot be in 1 or 4 (from CLOPS: P(-) means not in 4; from PISCO: P(-) means not in 1).  
  So P must be in 5.

But both C and P must be in 5 – impossible.

Thus the only consistent case is Case 1 with S in position 1, but no valid word seems to exist.  
This suggests an error in earlier deductions.

Rechecking feedback interpretation:
- AROSE: S(-) – S in word, not position 4.
- STOIC: S(✓) – S in position 1.
- CLOPS: S(-) – S in word, not position 5.
- PISCO: S(-) – S in word, not position 3.

Thus S must be in position 1.

From STOIC: S(✓) in position 1 is correct.

Thus the word must start with S, have O in 3, and contain C and P elsewhere.

With:
- C must be in 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so C is in 2 or 5.
- P must be in 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so P is in 2 or 5.

Possible:
- If C is in 2, then P must be in 5: S C O _ P
- If C is in 5, then P must be in 2: S P O _ C

For S C O _ P: position 4 must be a letter not ruled out (not A, R, E, T, I, L).  
Valid word: S C O P _ – but we need 5 letters: S C O _ P.  
Possible: S C O P Y – ""SCOPY"" – not valid.  
S C O P E – ""SCOPE"" – but E is ruled out.  
S C O P T – ""SCOPT"" – not valid.

For S P O _ C: position 4 must be a letter not ruled out.  
Valid word: S P O N C – ""SPONC"" – not valid.  
S P O K C – ""SPKOC"" – not valid.  
S P O U C – ""SPOUC"" – not valid.  
S P O D C – ""SPDLC"" – not valid.

This indicates we might have missed a word.  
Upon reflection, the word ""SCOOP"" comes to mind but has two O's.  
Let's check ""SCOOP"":
- S C O O P
- Position 1: S (✓ from STOIC)
- Position 2: C (must be in 2 or 5)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: O (allowed, not ruled out)
- Position 5: P (must be in 2 or 5, here 5)

This fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (from STOIC)
- C in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (from all guesses)
- P in position 5 (allowed)
- No A, R, E, T, I, L in the word.

""SCOOP"" is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>SCOOP</guess>Based on all previous feedback, the only consistent pattern is:
- Position 1: S (from STOIC)
- Position 3: O (confirmed)
- C must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 1,4,5)
- P must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 1,4, and 2 is taken by C)
- Position 4 must be a letter not yet ruled out; the only remaining common letter that fits is O, forming ""SCOOP"".",Guess 5: SCOOP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) O(✓) O(-) P(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters and their positions early on. If any of these letters are in the word, I'll get feedback that can help narrow down future guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and is in the 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Does not contain A, R, or E.

Good letters left to try: S, T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A word that fits: ""STOIC""
- S in position 1 (not position 4, so allowed by feedback)
- T
- O in position 3 (matches feedback)
- I
- C

No A, R, or E, and S is in position 1.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (from both guesses).
2. S is in the word and is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and is NOT in position 1 (from STOIC).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
   But position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I.
4. C is in the word but not in position 5 (from STOIC), so C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   Position 3 is O, so C is in 1, 2, or 4.
5. We still need to place the remaining letters: S, C, and three others that have not been used yet.

Possible remaining common letters: N, L, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has S in position 2 (since position 5 is also possible but let’s test 2).
- Has C in position 4 (since it can’t be 5).
- Uses new letters for positions 1 and 5.

A candidate: “CUSPY”
- C in 1 (allowed), U in 2 (new), S in 3 (but 3 must be O – conflict).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SCOUR”
- S in 1 (but S can’t be in 1).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SPOON”
- S in 1 (invalid).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SNOUT”
- S in 1 (invalid).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “CLOUD”
- C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, U in 4, D in 5.  
  S is missing – invalid.

Next candidate: “SCOFF”
- S in 1 (invalid).  
  Doesn’t work.

Next candidate: “SUGAR” – contains A and R (invalid).

Next candidate: “SUNNY” – contains N, Y; S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SLOSH”
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPOOF” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SWORD” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CLOUD” – no S.

Next candidate: “COUCH” – no S.

Next candidate: “COULD” – no S.

Next candidate: “CUPID” – no S.

Next candidate: “CYTON” – no S.

Next candidate: “DOUCY” – no S.

Next candidate: “MUCID” – no S.

Next candidate: “PUDGY” – no S.

Next candidate: “SNUCK” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPUNK” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SUSHY” – S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CUPID” – no S.

Next candidate: “CLOPS” – C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, P in 4, S in 5.  
  S is in 5 – allowed (S can be 2 or 5).  
  C is in 1 – allowed.  
  Letters used: C, L, O, P, S – none are ruled out.  
  This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- Position 3: O – ✓  
- S is in 5 – allowed (not in 1 or 4) – ✓  
- C is in 1 – allowed (not in 5) – ✓  
- No A, R, E, T, I – ✓  

So “CLOPS” is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Position 3 is O (confirmed by all guesses).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. C is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.  
   Therefore C must be in position 4.
4. P is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   Possible positions for P: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
   Position 3 is O, position 2 is S, so P must be in 1 or 5.
5. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I, L.

So far we have:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: C
- Positions 1 and 5: must be filled by P and one other unused letter (since P must be in 1 or 5).

The remaining unused common letters: N, D, U, M, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has S in position 2
- Has O in position 3
- Has C in position 4
- Has P in position 1 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible candidates:
- P _ S O C _ (position 1 = P, position 5 must be a new letter)
- _ _ S O C P (position 5 = P, position 1 must be a new letter)

Looking at the first pattern: P _ S O C _
We need a valid 5-letter word starting with P, having S in 2, O in 3, C in 4, and any letter in 5 that hasn't been ruled out.  
A valid word: PUSCO (but PUSCO isn't a common English word).

Second pattern: _ _ S O C P  
We need a valid 5-letter word ending in P, with S in 2, O in 3, C in 4.  
Valid word: MUSCP (invalid), DUSCP (invalid), NUSCP (invalid), YUSCP (invalid).

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be of the form:  
[1] [2=S] [3=O] [4=C] [5] with P in 1 or 5.

If P is in 1: P S O C _ (but S must be in 2, not 1) – invalid.

Wait, positions are fixed:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: C
- P must be in 1 or 5.

So possible forms:
- P _ S O C _ (but this is 6 letters) – no.

Actually, the word structure is:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: S
Position 3: O
Position 4: C
Position 5: ?

And P must be in position 1 or 5.

So possible words:
- P S O C _ (position 1 = P, position 5 = ?) – but this is 5 letters: P S O C ?
- _ S O C P (position 5 = P, position 1 = ?)

Looking at _ S O C P: we need a valid 5-letter word ending in P with S in 2, O in 3, C in 4.  
Valid word: MUSCP (invalid), DUSCP (invalid), NUSCP (invalid), YUSCP (invalid).

Looking at P S O C _: we need a valid 5-letter word starting with P, having S in 2, O in 3, C in 4, and any letter in 5.  
Valid word: PUSCO (valid, though uncommon), or maybe PISCO (a type of wine).

""PISCO"" is a valid 5-letter word (a brand of wine). Let's check:
- Position 1: P (allowed)
- Position 2: S (required)
- Position 3: O (required)
- Position 4: C (required)
- Position 5: S (not ruled out, and PISCO is valid)

But wait, PISCO has S in position 5, which is allowed (S can be in 2 or 5).  
And P is in position 1, which is allowed.

Let's verify no ruled-out letters: A, R, E, T, I, L – none appear in PISCO.

Thus, PISCO is a valid next guess.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (confirmed by every guess).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STOIC and PISCO).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (from CLOPS and PISCO).  
   Therefore C must be in position 3.  
   But position 3 is already O – this is impossible.  
   Conclusion: C is NOT in the word (the feedback for CLOPS said C(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 5, and for PISCO C(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 4).  
   However, there is no position left for C that is consistent with all feedback.  
   Re-examining:

   - From CLOPS: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - From PISCO: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 4.  
   Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5.  
   Position 3 is O, position 2 is S (from point 2), so C must be in position 5.

4. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from CLOPS and PISCO).  
   Therefore P must be in position 4.

5. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, T, I, L.

So far we have:
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: C
- Position 1: ?

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: C

The only common word fitting this pattern is **USP** + **OC** – but that’s 4 letters.  
Actually, the pattern is: _ S O P C.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? S O P C.

Valid English word: **USP** + **OC** doesn’t exist.  
Wait, the word must be: [1] S O P C.

A valid 5-letter word: **USP** + **OC** – no.  
Actually, the word is **USP** + **OC** – but that’s not a word.

Wait, the pattern is: [1] [2=S] [3=O] [4=P] [5=C] – i.e., ?SOPC.

The only valid English word fitting this is **USP** + **OC** – no.

Actually, the word must be: [1] S O P C.

A valid 5-letter word: **USP** + **OC** – no.

Wait, let's think of words ending in -SP... no.

Actually, the word must be: _ S O P C.

Valid word: **USP** + **OC** – no.

Wait, let's list possible first letters: common consonants not ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for _ S O P C:

- B: BSO... no
- D: DSO... no
- F: FSO... no
- G: GSO... no
- H: HSO... no
- J: JSO... no
- K: KSO... no
- M: MSO... no
- N: NSO... no
- V: VSO... no
- W: WSO... no
- Y: YSO... no

None of these are valid.  
This suggests an inconsistency in our deductions.  
Re-examining:

From PISCO feedback: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 1.  
From CLOPS feedback: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4.  
Therefore P must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so P must be in position 5.

Similarly, C must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so C must be in position 5.  
Thus both P and C must be in position 5, which is impossible.

Conclusion: There is no valid 5-letter word that satisfies all feedback so far.  
However, since the puzzle guarantees a solution, we must have made an error.

Rechecking:

From CLOPS: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.  
From PISCO: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 4.  
Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5.  
Position 3 is O, position 2 is S, so C must be in position 5.

From PISCO: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 1.  
From CLOPS: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4.  
Possible positions for P: 2, 3, 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is O, so P must be in position 5.

Thus both C and P must be in position 5 – impossible.

This indicates our deduction that S must be in position 2 is incorrect.  
Re-examining S:

From STOIC: S(✓) means S is in position 1.  
But from AROSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

From CLOPS: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
Thus S must be in position 1 or 2.

From PISCO: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3 (already O) or 5, so S must be in position 1 or 2.

Combining:
- Position 1: possible S or other
- Position 2: possible S or other
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

Also:
- C must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so C is in 2 or 5.
- P must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so P is in 2 or 5.

Possible cases:

Case 1: S in position 1
Then:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: C or P
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

And remaining letters must include the other (P or C) and any needed.

Case 2: S in position 2
Then:
- Position 2: S
- Position 1: ?
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

And C and P must be in 5 (but can't both be in 5).

Thus Case 1 is more promising.

Let's try Case 1: S _ O _ _
With C and P needing placement.

From CLOPS: C(-) means C is not in position 1 (ok, since position 1 is S).  
From PISCO: C(-) means C is not in position 4, so C must be in 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is not S (since S is in 1), position 3 is O, so C must be in 5.

Similarly, P must be in 2 or 5.  
Position 2 is not S (it's free), so P could be in 2 or 5.  
But C is in 5, so P must be in 2.

Thus:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: C

We need a valid 5-letter word: S P O _ C.

Possible letters for position 4 (not ruled out: not A, R, E, T, I, L).  
Common remaining letters: N, D, U, M, Y, etc.

Valid word: S P O N C – ""SPONC"" – not valid.  
S P O D C – ""SPODC"" – not valid.  
S P O U C – ""SPOUC"" – not valid.  
S P O M C – ""SPOMC"" – not valid.  
S P O Y C – ""SPYOC"" – not valid.

This suggests an inconsistency.  
Re-examining: maybe S is in position 2.

Case 2: S in position 2
Then:
- Position 2: S
- Position 1: ?
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

C and P must be in 1, 4, or 5, but:
- C cannot be in 1 or 4 (from CLOPS: C(-) means not in 1; from PISCO: C(-) means not in 4).  
  So C must be in 5.
- P cannot be in 1 or 4 (from CLOPS: P(-) means not in 4; from PISCO: P(-) means not in 1).  
  So P must be in 5.

But both C and P must be in 5 – impossible.

Thus the only consistent case is Case 1 with S in position 1, but no valid word seems to exist.  
This suggests an error in earlier deductions.

Rechecking feedback interpretation:
- AROSE: S(-) – S in word, not position 4.
- STOIC: S(✓) – S in position 1.
- CLOPS: S(-) – S in word, not position 5.
- PISCO: S(-) – S in word, not position 3.

Thus S must be in position 1.

From STOIC: S(✓) in position 1 is correct.

Thus the word must start with S, have O in 3, and contain C and P elsewhere.

With:
- C must be in 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so C is in 2 or 5.
- P must be in 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4).  
  Position 3 is O, so P is in 2 or 5.

Possible:
- If C is in 2, then P must be in 5: S C O _ P
- If C is in 5, then P must be in 2: S P O _ C

For S C O _ P: position 4 must be a letter not ruled out (not A, R, E, T, I, L).  
Valid word: S C O P _ – but we need 5 letters: S C O _ P.  
Possible: S C O P Y – ""SCOPY"" – not valid.  
S C O P E – ""SCOPE"" – but E is ruled out.  
S C O P T – ""SCOPT"" – not valid.

For S P O _ C: position 4 must be a letter not ruled out.  
Valid word: S P O N C – ""SPONC"" – not valid.  
S P O K C – ""SPKOC"" – not valid.  
S P O U C – ""SPOUC"" – not valid.  
S P O D C – ""SPDLC"" – not valid.

This indicates we might have missed a word.  
Upon reflection, the word ""SCOOP"" comes to mind but has two O's.  
Let's check ""SCOOP"":
- S C O O P
- Position 1: S (✓ from STOIC)
- Position 2: C (must be in 2 or 5)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: O (allowed, not ruled out)
- Position 5: P (must be in 2 or 5, here 5)

This fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (from STOIC)
- C in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (from all guesses)
- P in position 5 (allowed)
- No A, R, E, T, I, L in the word.

""SCOOP"" is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>SCOOP</guess>Based on all previous feedback, the only consistent pattern is:
- Position 1: S (from STOIC)
- Position 3: O (confirmed)
- C must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 1,4,5)
- P must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 1,4, and 2 is taken by C)
- Position 4 must be a letter not yet ruled out; the only remaining common letter that fits is O, forming ""SCOOP"".

From the latest feedback (SCOOP):

- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1  
- C(✓) – C is correct in position 2  
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 3  
- O(-) – the second O is in the word but not in position 4  
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 5  

So the pattern is:  
S C O _ P  

The fourth letter must be:
- an English letter  
- not any of the already ruled-out letters A, R, E, T, I, L  
- and must make a valid 5-letter word “SCO_P”.

Common unused consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Testing the most common ones:
- N → SCOOP (already guessed)  
- D → SCODP – invalid  
- M → SCOMP – invalid  
- K → SCOKP – invalid  
- B → SCOBP – invalid  
- G → SCOGP – invalid  
- Y → SCOYP – invalid  
- H → SCOHP – invalid  
- U → SCOU P – invalid  
- F → SCOF P – invalid  

Wait, we missed one:  
The only common letter left that forms a valid word is **N**, but “SCONP” isn’t a word.  
Actually, the correct word is **SCOUR** but R is ruled out.  
Next candidate: **SCOFF** – F is allowed, and “SCOFF” is valid.

Let’s check:
- S C O F P – “SCOFF” is a valid word.  
- All letters fit the constraints: S(1), C(2), O(3), P(5), and F is unused.

Therefore, the missing letter is F.
