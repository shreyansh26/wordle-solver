### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because:
1. C and R are very common consonants
2. A and E are the most common vowels
3. N is a common letter that appears in many words
4. It covers 5 distinct letters with no repeats

This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in the first position, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Common starting words include:\n- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)\n- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because:\n1. C and R are very common consonants\n2. A and E are the most common vowels\n3. N is a common letter that appears in many words\n4.

We now have:

1. Pattern: D R I _ _
2. Letters known NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, T, L
3. Remaining single-letter slots must be filled from: B, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “DRI” and ends with any two letters from the allowed set.

Possible endings (two-letter combinations from remaining letters):
- BM, BP, BQ, BS, BU, BV, BW, BX, BY, BZ
- GM, GO, GP, GQ, GS, GU, GV, GW, GX, GY, GZ
- … and so on for H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Scanning common English words:
- DRIP + S → DRIPS (S is allowed, second letter P is allowed)  
- DRIP + K → DRIPK (not a word)  
- DRIP + M → DRIPM (not a word)  
- DRIP + B → DRIPB (not a word)  
- DRIP + S is the only common word left.

DRIPS is a valid word and uses only allowed letters (P and S are not forbidden).

Hence, DRIPS is the logical next guess.
