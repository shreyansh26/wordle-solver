### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it has:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE → A x, R x, O x, S -, E x):
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E.
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (SLUMP → S -, L x, U -, M x, P x):
- Letters ruled out: L, M, P.
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- U is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

So far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and U.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- U cannot be in position 3.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the 7 ruled-out ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Among these, we still need to place S and U and fill the other three slots with allowed letters.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and U.
2. S is in position 2, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 4).
3. U is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 3).
4. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A quick scan of common words that fit these constraints:
- “CUBIC” – but C is allowed, but I is allowed, but B is allowed, but we don’t know about C or B yet. However, we have no info on I yet, but we can test it.
- “SUSTAINED” – too long.
- “SUNNY” – but N is allowed, Y is allowed, but we don’t know about N or Y yet.
- “SUSHY” – S is allowed, U is allowed, S is allowed, H is allowed, Y is allowed. This seems promising.

Let’s check “SUSHY”:
- Letters: S, U, S, H, Y.
- S appears twice, which is fine (letters can repeat).
- S positions: first and third. We know S can’t be in position 1 (from SLUMP feedback), so this would give us info on S in position 3.
- U appears once, in position 2, which is allowed (U can’t be in position 3, but 2 is fine).
- H and Y are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it has:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S but not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Has S not in position 4.

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word with S and some of these remaining letters. A good candidate is ""SLUMP"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- L, U, M, P are all allowed letters not yet ruled out.
- No A, R, O, E are present.

This should give us new information about which of the remaining letters are in the word.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE → A x, R x, O x, S -, E x):
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E.
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (SLUMP → S -, L x, U -, M x, P x):
- Letters ruled out: L, M, P.
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- U is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

So far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and U.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- U cannot be in position 3.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the 7 ruled-out ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Among these, we still need to place S and U and fill the other three slots with allowed letters.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and U.
2. S is in position 2, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 4).
3. U is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 3).
4. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A quick scan of common words that fit these constraints:
- “CUBIC” – but C is allowed, but I is allowed, but B is allowed, but we don’t know about C or B yet. However, we have no info on I yet, but we can test it.
- “SUSTAINED” – too long.
- “SUNNY” – but N is allowed, Y is allowed, but we don’t know about N or Y yet.
- “SUSHY” – S is allowed, U is allowed, S is allowed, H is allowed, Y is allowed. This seems promising.

Let’s check “SUSHY”:
- Letters: S, U, S, H, Y.
- S appears twice, which is fine (letters can repeat).
- S positions: first and third. We know S can’t be in position 1 (from SLUMP feedback), so this would give us info on S in position 3.
- U appears once, in position 2, which is allowed (U can’t be in position 3, but 2 is fine).
- H and Y are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

From the latest feedback (YUNKS → Y✓ U✓ N x K✓ S✓) we now know:

- Every letter in YUNKS is in the secret word and in the correct position, except N which is not in the word at all.
- Therefore the secret word is:
  1: Y
  2: U
  3: ?
  4: K
  5: S

So the pattern is Y U _ K S.

The missing third letter must be from the remaining unused letters (letters we have not yet ruled out and not yet confirmed).  
Letters already ruled out (from all previous guesses): A, R, O, E, L, M, P, H, N.  
Letters already used and confirmed: Y, U, K, S.  
Remaining candidate letters for the blank (position 3): B, C, D, F, G, I, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a common 5-letter English word of the form Y U _ K S.

Checking possibilities:
- Y U B K S – not a word
- Y U C K S – not a word
- Y U D K S – not a word
- Y U F K S – not a word
- Y U G K S – not a word
- Y U I K S – not a word
- Y U T K S – not a word
- Y U V K S – not a word
- Y U W K S – not a word
- Y U X K S – not a word
- Y U Z K S – not a word

Wait—let’s double-check the dictionary for any valid word matching YU_KS.

The only common English word that fits is “YUCKS” (plural of yuck), which uses the letter C in the third position.

All letters in YUCKS are allowed (C has not been ruled out yet), and it satisfies every constraint we have so far.

Therefore, the secret word must be YUCKS.
