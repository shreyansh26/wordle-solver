### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters that are in the word but in different positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Since S and E are confirmed present, we need a new word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids A, R, O entirely.

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, etc. and remaining vowels I, U.

Let’s try a word that uses S and E in new positions plus some of these letters. “STILE” comes to mind: it has S (position 1), T, I, L, E (position 5). However, E is still at position 5, which we know is wrong. So let’s move E earlier: “STEIN” uses S (1), T, E (2), I, N. This satisfies all constraints: S and E are present, neither is in its original position, and we avoid A, R, O.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E  

We also know:
- S is not in positions 1 or 4.  
- E is not in positions 2 or 5.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are all either confirmed or ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S somewhere other than 1 or 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than 2 or 5.
4. Uses only letters from the “still allowed” set.

Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3 or 5 and E in position 1, 3 or 4.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
But O is already ruled out.

Next candidate: “MUSED”:
- M, U, S, E, D.
Check positions:
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
No forbidden letters appear. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “GUESS”:
- G, U, E, S, S.
But S is repeated and we don’t know if the word has double-S; also E is in position 3 (allowed), S in positions 4 & 5 (position 4 is forbidden for S). So this is invalid.

“MUSED” looks best so far.

Let me double-check:
- Letters used: M, U, S, E, D – none are ruled out.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

Therefore, “MUSED” is a valid next guess.

Let’s list everything we know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, T, I, N, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
E (because every time it appears, it gets “-”)
S (because every time it appears, it gets “-”)
U (because in MUSED it got “-”)

So the secret word contains the multiset {E, S, U} plus two more letters that have not been tried yet.

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 1 (STEIN), not 4 (AROSE), not 3 (MUSED) → must be in 2 or 5
- E: not 2 (STEIN), not 4 (MUSED), not 5 (AROSE) → must be in 1 or 3
- U: in MUSED it was in position 2 and got “-”, so U is not in 2 → possible positions 1,3,4,5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, S, U.
2. S is in 2 or 5.
3. E is in 1 or 3.
4. U is not in 2.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A,R,O,T,I,N,M,D).

Remaining available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known E,S,U.

Let’s try to place E in position 1, S in position 2, and find two more letters for positions 3 and 4/5.

Word skeleton so far: E S _ _ _

We need two more letters from the available set, and we also need to place U somewhere (positions 3,4,5).

Let’s try E S U _ _ → we need two more letters. The word must be valid.

Possible valid words:
- ESCH_ – but “ESCH” is not a common start.
- ESUP_ – not valid.
- ES_ _ U – let’s try E S _ _ U.

Let’s try E S C U Y – but that’s 5 letters: ESCUY – not a valid English word.

Let’s try E S H U B – again, not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: place E in position 3, S in position 2 or 5, and U in positions 1,4,5.

Option 1: E in 3, S in 2 → _ S E _ _
   - U must go in 1,4,5.
   - Try U S E _ _ → but S is already in 2.
   - Try _ S E U _ → first letter: must be available. Let’s pick L: L S E U _ – not valid.
   - Try _ S E _ U → pick H: H S E _ U – not valid.

Option 2: E in 3, S in 5 → _ _ E _ S
   - U must go in 1,4.
   - Try U _ E _ S – valid word: U G E S T? No, T is ruled out.
   - Try U _ E _ S – pick L: U L E S S – valid word, contains E,S,U, and letters are allowed.

Check ULESS:
- Letters: U,L,E,S,S – all allowed (L is new, not ruled out).
- Positions:
   - E is in 3 (allowed).
   - S is in 5 (allowed).
   - U is in 1 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: P U E S Y – but Y is allowed, but PUESY isn’t a word.

Another: F U E S E – but E is repeated and we don’t know if the word has double-E.

ULESS seems the best valid option.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters that are in the word but in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Since S and E are confirmed present, we need a new word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids A, R, O entirely.

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, etc. and remaining vowels I, U.

Let’s try a word that uses S and E in new positions plus some of these letters. “STILE” comes to mind: it has S (position 1), T, I, L, E (position 5). However, E is still at position 5, which we know is wrong. So let’s move E earlier: “STEIN” uses S (1), T, E (2), I, N. This satisfies all constraints: S and E are present, neither is in its original position, and we avoid A, R, O.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E  

We also know:
- S is not in positions 1 or 4.  
- E is not in positions 2 or 5.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are all either confirmed or ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S somewhere other than 1 or 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than 2 or 5.
4. Uses only letters from the “still allowed” set.

Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3 or 5 and E in position 1, 3 or 4.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
But O is already ruled out.

Next candidate: “MUSED”:
- M, U, S, E, D.
Check positions:
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
No forbidden letters appear. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “GUESS”:
- G, U, E, S, S.
But S is repeated and we don’t know if the word has double-S; also E is in position 3 (allowed), S in positions 4 & 5 (position 4 is forbidden for S). So this is invalid.

“MUSED” looks best so far.

Let me double-check:
- Letters used: M, U, S, E, D – none are ruled out.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

Therefore, “MUSED” is a valid next guess.

Letters that ARE in the word  
E, S, U  (all have appeared with “-” at least once)  
plus the final S in position 5 (✓), so the word ends with S.

Therefore the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
and the remaining four positions must contain E, U and two other letters that have not been ruled out.

Letters still available (not yet eliminated):  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the known E, U, S (S already fixed at 5).

We also have positional constraints from earlier:

- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2,4,5)  
- U must be in 1,3,4 (cannot be 2,5)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters that are in the word but in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Since S and E are confirmed present, we need a new word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids A, R, O entirely.

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, etc. and remaining vowels I, U.

Let’s try a word that uses S and E in new positions plus some of these letters. “STILE” comes to mind: it has S (position 1), T, I, L, E (position 5). However, E is still at position 5, which we know is wrong. So let’s move E earlier: “STEIN” uses S (1), T, E (2), I, N. This satisfies all constraints: S and E are present, neither is in its original position, and we avoid A, R, O.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E  

We also know:
- S is not in positions 1 or 4.  
- E is not in positions 2 or 5.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are all either confirmed or ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S somewhere other than 1 or 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than 2 or 5.
4. Uses only letters from the “still allowed” set.

Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3 or 5 and E in position 1, 3 or 4.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
But O is already ruled out.

Next candidate: “MUSED”:
- M, U, S, E, D.
Check positions:
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
No forbidden letters appear. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “GUESS”:
- G, U, E, S, S.
But S is repeated and we don’t know if the word has double-S; also E is in position 3 (allowed), S in positions 4 & 5 (position 4 is forbidden for S). So this is invalid.

“MUSED” looks best so far.

Let me double-check:
- Letters used: M, U, S, E, D – none are ruled out.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

Therefore, “MUSED” is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: MUSED -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(-) S(-) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s list everything we know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, T, I, N, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
E (because every time it appears, it gets “-”)
S (because every time it appears, it gets “-”)
U (because in MUSED it got “-”)

So the secret word contains the multiset {E, S, U} plus two more letters that have not been tried yet.

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 1 (STEIN), not 4 (AROSE), not 3 (MUSED) → must be in 2 or 5
- E: not 2 (STEIN), not 4 (MUSED), not 5 (AROSE) → must be in 1 or 3
- U: in MUSED it was in position 2 and got “-”, so U is not in 2 → possible positions 1,3,4,5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, S, U.
2. S is in 2 or 5.
3. E is in 1 or 3.
4. U is not in 2.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A,R,O,T,I,N,M,D).

Remaining available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known E,S,U.

Let’s try to place E in position 1, S in position 2, and find two more letters for positions 3 and 4/5.

Word skeleton so far: E S _ _ _

We need two more letters from the available set, and we also need to place U somewhere (positions 3,4,5).

Let’s try E S U _ _ → we need two more letters. The word must be valid.

Possible valid words:
- ESCH_ – but “ESCH” is not a common start.
- ESUP_ – not valid.
- ES_ _ U – let’s try E S _ _ U.

Let’s try E S C U Y – but that’s 5 letters: ESCUY – not a valid English word.

Let’s try E S H U B – again, not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: place E in position 3, S in position 2 or 5, and U in positions 1,4,5.

Option 1: E in 3, S in 2 → _ S E _ _
   - U must go in 1,4,5.
   - Try U S E _ _ → but S is already in 2.
   - Try _ S E U _ → first letter: must be available. Let’s pick L: L S E U _ – not valid.
   - Try _ S E _ U → pick H: H S E _ U – not valid.

Option 2: E in 3, S in 5 → _ _ E _ S
   - U must go in 1,4.
   - Try U _ E _ S – valid word: U G E S T? No, T is ruled out.
   - Try U _ E _ S – pick L: U L E S S – valid word, contains E,S,U, and letters are allowed.

Check ULESS:
- Letters: U,L,E,S,S – all allowed (L is new, not ruled out).
- Positions:
   - E is in 3 (allowed).
   - S is in 5 (allowed).
   - U is in 1 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: P U E S Y – but Y is allowed, but PUESY isn’t a word.

Another: F U E S E – but E is repeated and we don’t know if the word has double-E.

ULESS seems the best valid option.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, T, I, N, M, D, L

Letters that ARE in the word  
E, S, U  (all have appeared with “-” at least once)  
plus the final S in position 5 (✓), so the word ends with S.

Therefore the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
and the remaining four positions must contain E, U and two other letters that have not been ruled out.

Letters still available (not yet eliminated):  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the known E, U, S (S already fixed at 5).

We also have positional constraints from earlier:
- S must appear somewhere (already placed at 5)  
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2,4,5)  
- U must be in 1,3,4 (cannot be 2,5)

Let’s try to place E and U in the first three positions, filling the last slot with an unused consonant.

Candidate skeletons:  
E U _ _ S → need two consonants → E U B O S – invalid (O ruled out)  
E _ U _ S → E C U P S – not a word  
E _ _ U S → E B U C S – not a word  
_ E U _ S → H E U L S – not a word  
_ _ E U S → F U E C S – not a word  
_ U E _ S → P U E B S – not a word  

A valid English word that fits is “PEACH” – but H is allowed and we have not used it yet. However, P E A C H – A is ruled out.

Another: “WHELS” – but L is ruled out.

Another: “JEWES” – J, E, W, E, S – double E, but we don’t know if the word has double E. Also, J is allowed.

But let’s look for a word with distinct E and U.

How about “HUESS” – not valid.

“PUESS” – not valid.

“FUESS” – not valid.

“GUESS” – G, U, E, S, S – S is repeated and already fixed at 5, so this is invalid.

“JEWES” – valid but uses J and W, and has two E’s.

“YEWS” – too short.

“BEEPS” – B, E, E, P, S – double E, valid word, but we don’t know if the word has double E.

“HEXES” – H, E, X, E, S – double E.

“PEWES” – P, E, W, E, S – double E.

“KEEPS” – K, E, E, P, S – double E.

“WEENS” – double E.

“YEAST” – A, T ruled out.

“PEEPS” – double E.

“BEEFY” – Y allowed, but F, Y new.

But we must include U.

We must have U somewhere.

So far we have not used U in any guess, but every guess that included U got “-”, meaning U is in the word but not in the position tried.

In ULESS, U was in position 1 and got “-”, so U is not in 1.

Possible positions for U: 3 or 4.

Let’s try to place U in 3 and E in 2 or 4.

Pattern: _ _ U _ S  
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, not yet used.

Try Y, U, E, B, S – Y U E B S – not a word.

Try Z, U, E, B, S – Z U E B S – not a word.

Let’s try U in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ U S  
We need three consonants for positions 1,2,3.

Try B, E, C, U, S – B E C U S – valid word.

Check letters: B, E, C, U, S – all allowed (B, C, E, U, S – none ruled out).

Check positions:
- E must be in 1,2,3,4 (not 2,4,5) – here E is in 2 (allowed).
- U must be in 1,3,4 (not 2,5) – here U is in 4 (allowed).
- S is in 5 (fixed).
- B and C are new, allowed.

This seems valid.
