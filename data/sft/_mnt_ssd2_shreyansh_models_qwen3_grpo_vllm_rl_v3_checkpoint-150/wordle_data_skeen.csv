For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of the alphabet. This helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. 

Common strategies for the first guess include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc.
2. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize coverage
3. Choosing a word that is a common 5-letter word

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ E  (but E is not in position 5)

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoiding L, A, T.

Possible next steps:
1. Pick words starting with S that include E in positions 2-4.
2. Avoid letters L, A, T.
3. Try to introduce new common consonants (R, N, I, O, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

Some candidates:
- SHINE (S H I N E) – uses H, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- SPEER (S P E E R) – but double E might not be optimal.
- SCREE – but C and R haven't been tested, and double E again.
- SNORE – uses N, O, R.

I'll go with SHINE as it introduces H, I, N and keeps E in position 4, satisfying the feedback.

Best seems SCORE: S C O R E – uses new letters C, O, R, places E in 4, N hasn’t been used yet but we can test N in next guess if needed. Wait, SCORE doesn’t have N. Let’s try SPORE: S P O R E – still no N.

We need a word with both E and N. Let’s try:
- SNEER – N in 2, E in 3 and 4 (double E, but valid).
- SPORE – no N.
- SOWER – O, W new, E in 4, N in 3 (allowed).

SOWER: S O W E R – places E in 4, N in 3 (allowed), introduces O and W.

But let’s prioritize placing N and E together. Try:
- SOWER – S O W E R: E in 4, N in 3 (allowed), new letters O, W.

Another option: SPOKE – no N.

Best next guess: SOWER – tests O, W, places E in 4 and N in 3.

But let’s check if SOWER is valid – yes, it’s a common word.

Final choice: SOWER.

From the three rounds:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. SHINE → S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(-) E(-)
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - H, I are excluded.

3. SOWER → S(✓) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(x)
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.
   - O, W, R are excluded.

So the pattern is:
S _ _ E _

Letters to include: N (not in position 4, so possible in 2, 3, or 5)
Letters to exclude: L, A, T, H, I, O, W, R

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

We need a word starting with S, ending with _ _ E _, with N somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S C N E _ – but needs 5 letters.
- S N U E _ – but U and _?
- S P E N E – but E is already in position 4.
- S N E _ _ – but E is in position 4, so N could be in 2 or 3.

Let’s try:
- S P E N E – invalid (double E and N in 4, but E is fixed in 4).
- S C N E D – but D is allowed, let’s check: S C N E D – positions: S(1) C(2) N(3) E(4) D(5). This fits: N is in 3 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), and letters C, D haven’t been excluded.

But is SCNED a valid word? It seems like an acronym but not a common English word.

Next option: S N U E D – but U and D: S N U E D – valid word (past tense of ""snude"" isn't common).

Another: S P E N E – invalid.

Try: S C I E N T – but I and T excluded.

Try: S N E E P – but P is allowed, but double E.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
Positions: 1:S, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?

N must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Possible words:
- S N _ E _ – e.g., S N U E D (valid but uncommon)
- S _ N E _ – e.g., S C N E D (invalid)
- S _ _ E N – e.g., S C O E N – but O excluded.

Try: S C E N E – but E is in 4, so positions: S C E N E – E in 4 is correct, but N is in 3 (allowed), and C, E, N are used. But E is already in 4, so scene would be S C E N E – but this has E in 3 and 4, which is possible.

But is ""scene"" valid? Yes, it's a common word.

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- C new
- E in 3 – allowed (only position 5 is excluded for E)
- N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4 (from SHINE feedback), so this is invalid.

Thus, N must be in 2 or 3, and not in 4.

Another candidate: S P E N E – but N would be in 4 (invalid).

Try: S N E P E – but P is allowed, N in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (correct), but this seems like a stretch.

Next: S C U E N – but U and C: SCUE N – not a word.

Try: S M E N E – but M is allowed, N in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (correct), but SMENE isn't a word.

Another approach: use remaining letters C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y.

Possible word: S C R E N – but R is excluded.

Try: S C O E N – O excluded.

Try: S P U E N – not a word.

Try: S M U E N – not a word.

Try: S C H E N – H excluded.

Try: S C F E N – not a word.

Try: S C Y E N – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe N in position 2.

Pattern: S N _ E _

Letters allowed: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

Possible words:
- S N U E D – valid (past tense of ""snude"" is not common, but ""snude"" itself is a word meaning to snuff)

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of the alphabet. This helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. 

Common strategies for the first guess include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc.
2. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize coverage
3. Choosing a word that is a common 5-letter word

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ E  (but E is not in position 5)

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoiding L, A, T.

Possible next steps:
1. Pick words starting with S that include E in positions 2-4.
2. Avoid letters L, A, T.
3. Try to introduce new common consonants (R, N, I, O, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

Some candidates:
- SHINE (S H I N E) – uses H, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- SPEER (S P E E R) – but double E might not be optimal.
- SCREE – but C and R haven't been tested, and double E again.
- SNORE – uses N, O, R.

I'll go with SHINE as it introduces H, I, N and keeps E in position 4, satisfying the feedback.

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - First letter is S.

2. SHINE → S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(-) E(-)
   - Confirms S is correct in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - H and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Letters to include: E, N
- Letters to exclude: L, A, T, H, I
- E cannot be in position 5.
- N cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4.
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to place E and N while introducing new common letters (R, O, C, K, M, etc.).

Candidate words:
- SPORE – but P and O haven’t been tested, and E is in position 4 (allowed), N hasn’t been placed.
- SCORE – C and O new, E in 4, N in 5 (allowed).
- SNEER – N in 2, E in 3 and 4 (double E), but E must be single?
- SNARE – A is excluded.
- SPOKE – O, P, K new, E in 4, N in 2 (allowed).

Best seems SCORE: S C O R E – uses new letters C, O, R, places E in 4, N hasn’t been used yet but we can test N in next guess if needed. Wait, SCORE doesn’t have N. Let’s try SPORE: S P O R E – still no N.

We need a word with both E and N. Let’s try:
- SNEER – N in 2, E in 3 and 4 (double E, but valid).
- SPORE – no N.
- SOWER – O, W new, E in 4, N in 3 (allowed).

SOWER: S O W E R – places E in 4, N in 3 (allowed), introduces O and W.

But let’s prioritize placing N and E together. Try:
- SOWER – S O W E R: E in 4, N in 3 (allowed), new letters O, W.

Another option: SPOKE – no N.

Best next guess: SOWER – tests O, W, places E in 4 and N in 3.

But let’s check if SOWER is valid – yes, it’s a common word.

- S C N E D – but D is allowed, let’s check: S C N E D – positions: S(1) C(2) N(3) E(4) D(5). This fits: N is in 3 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), and letters C, D haven’t been excluded.

But is SCNED a valid word? It seems like an acronym but not a common English word.

Next option: S N U E D – but U and D: S N U E D – valid word (past tense of ""snude"" isn't common).

Another: S P E N E – invalid.

Try: S C I E N T – but I and T excluded.

Try: S N E E P – but P is allowed, but double E.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
Positions: 1:S, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?

N must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Possible words:
- S N _ E _ – e.g., S N U E D (valid but uncommon)
- S _ N E _ – e.g., S C N E D (invalid)
- S _ _ E N – e.g., S C O E N – but O excluded.

Try: S C E N E – but E is in 4, so positions: S C E N E – E in 4 is correct, but N is in 3 (allowed), and C, E, N are used. But E is already in 4, so scene would be S C E N E – but this has E in 3 and 4, which is possible.

But is ""scene"" valid? Yes, it's a common word.

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- C new
- E in 3 – allowed (only position 5 is excluded for E)
- N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4 (from SHINE feedback), so this is invalid.

Thus, N must be in 2 or 3, and not in 4.

Another candidate: S P E N E – but N would be in 4 (invalid).

Try: S N E P E – but P is allowed, N in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (correct), but this seems like a stretch.

Next: S C U E N – but U and C: SCUE N – not a word.

Try: S M E N E – but M is allowed, N in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (correct), but SMENE isn't a word.

Another approach: use remaining letters C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y.

Possible word: S C R E N – but R is excluded.

Try: S C O E N – O excluded.

Try: S P U E N – not a word.

Try: S M U E N – not a word.

Try: S C H E N – H excluded.

Try: S C A E N – A excluded.

Try: S C I E N – I excluded.

Try: S C L E N – L excluded.

Try: S C T E N – T excluded.

Try: S C D E N – not a word.

Try: S C G E N – not a word.

Try: S C K E N – not a word.

Try: S C F E N – not a word.

Try: S C Y E N – not a word.

Try: S C U E N – not a word.

Try: S C M E N – not a word.

This suggests we might need to use N in position 5.

Pattern: S _ _ E N

Letters allowed: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

Possible words:
- S C U E N – not a word.
- S P U E N – not a word.
- S C D E N – not a word.
- S C G E N – not a word.
- S C K E N – not a word.
- S C M E N – not a word.
- S C P E N – not a word.
- S C Y E N – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe N in position 2.

Pattern: S N _ E _

Letters allowed: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

Possible words:
- S N U E D – valid (past tense of ""snude"" is not common, but ""snude"" itself is a word meaning to snuff)
- S N O E D – O excluded.
- S N A E D – A excluded.
- S N I E D – I excluded.
- S N E E D – E in 3, D in 5: S N E E D – valid word (to fit or adjust something).

""SN E E D"" is a valid word meaning to adjust or fit something.

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- N(2) – allowed (not in 4)
- E(3) – allowed (only 5 excluded for E)
- E(4) – confirmed ✓
- D(5) – new letter

This seems to fit all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of the alphabet. This helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. 

Common strategies for the first guess include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc.
2. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize coverage
3. Choosing a word that is a common 5-letter word

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ E  (but E is not in position 5)

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoiding L, A, T.

Possible next steps:
1. Pick words starting with S that include E in positions 2-4.
2. Avoid letters L, A, T.
3. Try to introduce new common consonants (R, N, I, O, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

Some candidates:
- SHINE (S H I N E) – uses H, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- SPEER (S P E E R) – but double E might not be optimal.
- SCREE – but C and R haven't been tested, and double E again.
- SNORE – uses N, O, R.

I'll go with SHINE as it introduces H, I, N and keeps E in position 4, satisfying the feedback.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - First letter is S.
   - E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. SHINE → S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(-) E(-)
   - Confirms S is correct in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - H and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Letters to include: E, N
- Letters to exclude: L, A, T, H, I
- E cannot be in position 5.
- N cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4.
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to place E and N while introducing new common letters (R, O, C, K, M, etc.).

Candidate words:
- SPORE – but P and O haven’t been tested, and E is in position 4 (allowed), N hasn’t been placed.
- SCORE – C and O new, E in 4, N in 5 (allowed).
- SNEER – N in 2, E in 3 and 4 (double E), but E must be single?
- SNARE – A is excluded.
- SPOKE – O, P, K new, E in 4, N in 2 (allowed).

Best seems SCORE: S C O R E – uses new letters C, O, R, places E in 4, N hasn’t been used yet but we can test N in next guess if needed. Wait, SCORE doesn’t have N. Let’s try SPORE: S P O R E – still no N.

We need a word with both E and N. Let’s try:
- SNEER – N in 2, E in 3 and 4 (double E, but valid).
- SPORE – no N.
- SOWER – O, W new, E in 4, N in 3 (allowed).

SOWER: S O W E R – places E in 4, N in 3 (allowed), introduces O and W.

But let’s prioritize placing N and E together. Try:
- SOWER – S O W E R: E in 4, N in 3 (allowed), new letters O, W.

Another option: SPOKE – no N.

Best next guess: SOWER – tests O, W, places E in 4 and N in 3.

But let’s check if SOWER is valid – yes, it’s a common word.

Final choice: SOWER.

2. SHINE → S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(-) E(-)
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - H, I are excluded.

3. SOWER → S(✓) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(x)
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.
   - O, W, R are excluded.

So the pattern is:
S _ _ E _

Letters to include: N (not in position 4, so possible in 2, 3, or 5)
Letters to exclude: L, A, T, H, I, O, W, R

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

We need a word starting with S, ending with _ _ E _, with N somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S C N E _ – but needs 5 letters.
- S N U E _ – but U and _?
- S P E N E – but E is already in position 4.
- S N E _ _ – but E is in position 4, so N could be in 2 or 3.

Let’s try:
- S P E N E – invalid (double E and N in 4, but E is fixed in 4).
- S C N E D – but D is allowed, let’s check: S C N E D – positions: S(1) C(2) N(3) E(4) D(5). This fits: N is in 3 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), and letters C, D haven’t been excluded.

But is SCNED a valid word? It seems like an acronym but not a common English word.

Next option: S N U E D – but U and D: S N U E D – valid word (past tense of ""snude"" isn't common).

Another: S P E N E – invalid.

Try: S C I E N T – but I and T excluded.

Try: S N E E P – but P is allowed, but double E.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
Positions: 1:S, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?

N must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Possible words:
- S N _ E _ – e.g., S N U E D (valid but uncommon)
- S _ N E _ – e.g., S C N E D (invalid)
- S _ _ E N – e.g., S C O E N – but O excluded.

Try: S C E N E – but E is in 4, so positions: S C E N E – E in 4 is correct, but N is in 3 (allowed), and C, E, N are used. But E is already in 4, so scene would be S C E N E – but this has E in 3 and 4, which is possible.

But is ""scene"" valid? Yes, it's a common word.

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- C new
- E in 3 – allowed (only position 5 is excluded for E)
- N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4 (from SHINE feedback), so this is invalid.

Thus, N must be in 2 or 3, and not in 4.

Another candidate: S P E N E – but N would be in 4 (invalid).

Try: S N E P E – but P is allowed, N in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (correct), but this seems like a stretch.

Next: S C U E N – but U and C: SCUE N – not a word.

Try: S M E N E – but M is allowed, N in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (correct), but SMENE isn't a word.

Another approach: use remaining letters C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y.

Possible word: S C R E N – but R is excluded.

Try: S C O E N – O excluded.

Try: S P U E N – not a word.

Try: S M U E N – not a word.

Try: S C H E N – H excluded.

Try: S C A E N – A excluded.

Try: S C I E N – I excluded.

Try: S C L E N – L excluded.

Try: S C T E N – T excluded.

Try: S C D E N – not a word.

Try: S C G E N – not a word.

Try: S C K E N – not a word.

Try: S C F E N – not a word.

Try: S C Y E N – not a word.

Try: S C U E N – not a word.

Try: S C M E N – not a word.

This suggests we might need to use N in position 5.

Pattern: S _ _ E N

Letters allowed: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

Possible words:
- S C U E N – not a word.
- S P U E N – not a word.
- S C D E N – not a word.
- S C G E N – not a word.
- S C K E N – not a word.
- S C M E N – not a word.
- S C P E N – not a word.
- S C Y E N – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe N in position 2.

Pattern: S N _ E _

Letters allowed: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y

Possible words:
- S N U E D – valid (past tense of ""snude"" is not common, but ""snude"" itself is a word meaning to snuff)
- S N O E D – O excluded.
- S N A E D – A excluded.
- S N I E D – I excluded.
- S N E E D – E in 3, D in 5: S N E E D – valid word (to fit or adjust something).

""SN E E D"" is a valid word meaning to adjust or fit something.

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- N(2) – allowed (not in 4)
- E(3) – allowed (only 5 excluded for E)
- E(4) – confirmed ✓
- D(5) – new letter

This seems to fit all constraints.

The feedback for Guess 4 (""SN E E D"") says the model answer is not five letters. This is likely because ""SN E E D"" was entered with spaces, and the system requires a single 5-letter string without spaces.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has E in position 4
- Contains N somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5 allowed)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y (plus N, E, S)

Possible 5-letter words fitting these constraints:
- S C U E N – not valid
- S P U E N – not valid
- S C D E N – not valid
- S C G E N – not valid
- S C K E N – not valid
- S C M E N – not valid
- S C P E N – not valid
- S C Y E N – not valid
- S N U E D – invalid (6 letters with space)
- S N E E P – valid word, but P is allowed
- S N E P E – invalid
- S N E E T – T excluded
- S N E E D – invalid (space issue)
- S N E E R – R excluded
- S N E E K – valid word, K is allowed
- S N E E P – valid word, P is allowed

Between ""SNEEK"" and ""SNEEP"":
- ""SNEEK"" is valid (though rare)
- ""SNEEP"" is valid (to jump or leap)

""SNEEP"" seems more common, and it fits:
- S(1) ✓
- N(2) – allowed
- E(3) – allowed
- E(4) – confirmed ✓
- P(5) – new letter

This should be the next guess.

- S is correct in position 1.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is correct in positions 3 and 4.
- P is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
S _ E E _

Letters known to be in the word: S, N, E (with E fixed in positions 3 & 4)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, H, I, O, W, R, P

N must be in the word but cannot be in position 2 or 4 (since 4 is already E). Therefore N must be in position 5.

So the word must be:
S _ E E N

The only letter left to determine is position 2. It must be a letter not yet excluded and not already used (S, N, E are used). From earlier, allowed letters are C, D, F, G, K, M, U, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting S _ E E N:
- S C E E N – not a word
- S D E E N – not a word
- S F E E N – not a word
- S G E E N – not a word
- S K E E N – not a word
- S M E E N – not a word
- S U E E N – not a word
- S Y E E N – not a word

Wait, let's double-check:
Actually, ""SCENE"" is a word (S C E N E), but we've already had N in position 4 (which was E), so that's irrelevant. The correct pattern is S _ E E N.

Looking again, the only valid word seems to be ""SKEEN"" (a variant spelling of ""skene"" or ""skean""), but this is obscure. Another possibility is ""SMEE"" but that's 4 letters.

Upon reflection, the most likely valid word fitting S _ E E N is ""SKEEN"" (though rare), or there might be an error in earlier steps. However, checking standard dictionaries, ""SKEEN"" is listed as an old variant of ""skean"" (a dagger). Given the constraints, this appears to be the only possibility.

Thus, the next guess should be SKEEN.
