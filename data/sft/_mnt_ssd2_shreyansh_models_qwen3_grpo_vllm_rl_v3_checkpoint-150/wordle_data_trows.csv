For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should help eliminate or confirm several letters at once, regardless of the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → second letter is R
- O: correct position (✓) → third letter is O
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere, but not in position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O _ S

We also know A and E are not in the word, so we can avoid those letters.

Good next guesses would test the remaining positions. Let's try a word that fits _ R O _ _ and includes S in position 5, as that would confirm S is at the end. A common word fitting this is ""FRONT"", but we'd need to check if F and T are allowed. Alternatively, ""GROIN"" or ""CROOK"" might fit, but we should pick one that tests new common letters.

Another approach is to test S in position 1 with a word like ""SROOK"" (but this isn't a valid word). Instead, let's try ""SWORD"" - but this has D which might be less common. 

A better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but O is already confirmed in position 3, so ""CROOK"" would have O in position 3 and 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - this has G, R, O, I, N. R and O are confirmed, and I and N are new letters. This would test positions 1, 4, 5.

But to directly test S in position 5, ""FRONT"" is _ R O _ N, but N is position 5. Wait, ""FRONT"" is F R O N T, but our pattern is _ R O _ _. So ""FRONT"" would be F R O N T, which doesn't fit.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 5 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

But maybe a better word is ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. But this has O in position 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""SWORD"" - S W O R D. But R is already in position 2, so this would be S W O R D, which doesn't fit _ R O _ _.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 1 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N. 

But to test S in position 1, a valid word is ""SROOK"" (but not valid). Instead, ""SWORD"" doesn't fit.

Actually, let's try ""GROIN"" as it fits _ R O _ _ and tests new letters. 

But a better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but as noted, it has O in position 4 which might not fit.

But ""GROIN"" is G R O I N, which fits _ R O _ _ (positions 2 and 3 are R and O). This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Based on the feedback from AROSE:

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ R O _ _
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. GROIN → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - Confirms R in position 2 and O in position 3.
   - Eliminates G, I, N from the entire word.

Known letters:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- S must appear somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- Forbidden letters so far: A, E, G, I, N

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3
- Contains S (not in position 4)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O S _
- _ R O _ S

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ _ with S elsewhere:
- B R O S T
- C R O S S
- F R O S T
- P R O S T
- T R O S S
- W R O S T

Among these, ""FROST"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- F is still allowed
- R and O are in correct positions
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4) → so ""FROST"" is invalid
Wait, that contradicts our earlier finding that S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

Valid options:
- S R O _ _ : ""SROOK"" (invalid word)
- _ R O S _ : ""PROSE"" (but E is forbidden)
- _ R O _ S : ""CROCS"" (but C is allowed, but S is in position 5)

Looking again:

- P R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- T R O S S → S in position 4 (invalid)

So S must be in position 1 or 5. The only valid word I can see is:
- S R O _ _ : ""SROOK"" (invalid)
- _ R O _ S : ""CROPS"" (C, R, O, P, S) - all letters allowed

""CROPS"" fits:
- C (allowed)
- R in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed, and S is confirmed in word)

Thus, ""CROPS"" seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should help eliminate or confirm several letters at once, regardless of the feedback received.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → second letter is R
- O: correct position (✓) → third letter is O
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere, but not in position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O _ S

We also know A and E are not in the word, so we can avoid those letters.

Good next guesses would test the remaining positions. Let's try a word that fits _ R O _ _ and includes S in position 5, as that would confirm S is at the end. A common word fitting this is ""FRONT"", but we'd need to check if F and T are allowed. Alternatively, ""GROIN"" or ""CROOK"" might fit, but we should pick one that tests new common letters.

Another approach is to test S in position 1 with a word like ""SROOK"" (but this isn't a valid word). Instead, let's try ""SWORD"" - but this has D which might be less common. 

A better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but O is already confirmed in position 3, so ""CROOK"" would have O in position 3 and 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - this has G, R, O, I, N. R and O are confirmed, and I and N are new letters. This would test positions 1, 4, 5.

But to directly test S in position 5, ""FRONT"" is _ R O _ N, but N is position 5. Wait, ""FRONT"" is F R O N T, but our pattern is _ R O _ _. So ""FRONT"" would be F R O N T, which doesn't fit.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 5 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

But maybe a better word is ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. But this has O in position 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""SWORD"" - S W O R D. But R is already in position 2, so this would be S W O R D, which doesn't fit _ R O _ _.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 1 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N. 

But to test S in position 1, a valid word is ""SROOK"" (but not valid). Instead, ""SWORD"" doesn't fit. 

Let's try ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. This has O in position 3 and 4, but we know O is only in position 3. So this is invalid.

Another approach is to test S in position 5 with a word like ""GROIN"" - but G R O I N is _ R O I N. This would test I and N. 

Actually, let's try ""GROIN"" as it fits _ R O _ _ and tests new letters. 

But a better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but as noted, it has O in position 4 which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would give us feedback on G, I, N. 

However, looking back, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 4 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. 

But ""GROIN"" is G R O I N, which fits _ R O _ _ (positions 2 and 3 are R and O). This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- R is in position 2
- O is in position 3
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- A and E are not in the word

I'll test S in position 5 with the word ""GROIN"":

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should help eliminate or confirm several letters at once, regardless of the feedback received.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → second letter is R
- O: correct position (✓) → third letter is O
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere, but not in position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O _ S

We also know A and E are not in the word, so we can avoid those letters.

Good next guesses would test the remaining positions. Let's try a word that fits _ R O _ _ and includes S in position 5, as that would confirm S is at the end. A common word fitting this is ""FRONT"", but we'd need to check if F and T are allowed. Alternatively, ""GROIN"" or ""CROOK"" might fit, but we should pick one that tests new common letters.

Another approach is to test S in position 1 with a word like ""SROOK"" (but this isn't a valid word). Instead, let's try ""SWORD"" - but this has D which might be less common. 

A better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but O is already confirmed in position 3, so ""CROOK"" would have O in position 3 and 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - this has G, R, O, I, N. R and O are confirmed, and I and N are new letters. This would test positions 1, 4, 5.

But to directly test S in position 5, ""FRONT"" is _ R O _ N, but N is position 5. Wait, ""FRONT"" is F R O N T, but our pattern is _ R O _ _. So ""FRONT"" would be F R O N T, which doesn't fit.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 5 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

But maybe a better word is ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. But this has O in position 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""SWORD"" - S W O R D. But R is already in position 2, so this would be S W O R D, which doesn't fit _ R O _ _.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 1 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N. 

But to test S in position 1, a valid word is ""SROOK"" (but not valid). Instead, ""SWORD"" doesn't fit. 

Let's try ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. This has O in position 3 and 4, but we know O is only in position 3. So this is invalid.

Another approach is to test S in position 5 with a word like ""GROIN"" - but G R O I N is _ R O I N. This would test I and N. 

Actually, let's try ""GROIN"" as it fits _ R O _ _ and tests new letters. 

But a better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but as noted, it has O in position 4 which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would give us feedback on G, I, N. 

However, looking back, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 4 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. 

But ""GROIN"" is G R O I N, which fits _ R O _ _ (positions 2 and 3 are R and O). This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- R is in position 2
- O is in position 3
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- A and E are not in the word

I'll test S in position 5 with the word ""GROIN"":

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: GROIN -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ R O _ _
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. GROIN → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - Confirms R in position 2 and O in position 3.
   - Eliminates G, I, N from the entire word.

Known letters:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- S must appear somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- Forbidden letters so far: A, E, G, I, N

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3
- Contains S (not in position 4)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O S _
- _ R O _ S

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ _ with S elsewhere:
- B R O S T
- C R O S S
- F R O S T
- P R O S T
- T R O S S
- W R O S T

Among these, ""FROST"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- F is still allowed
- R and O are in correct positions
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4) → so ""FROST"" is invalid
Wait, that contradicts our earlier finding that S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

Valid options:
- S R O _ _ : ""SROOK"" (invalid word)
- _ R O S _ : ""PROSE"" (but E is forbidden)
- _ R O _ S : ""CROCS"" (but C is allowed, but S is in position 5)

Looking again:
- B R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- C R O S S → S in position 4 (invalid)
- D R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- P R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- T R O S S → S in position 4 (invalid)
- W R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)

So S must be in position 1 or 5. The only valid word I can see is:
- S R O _ _ : ""SROOK"" (invalid)
- _ R O _ S : ""CROPS"" (C, R, O, P, S) - all letters allowed

""CROPS"" fits:
- C (allowed)
- R in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed, and S is confirmed in word)

Thus, ""CROPS"" seems like the best next guess.

Guess 3: CROPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
2. GROIN → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
3. CROPS → C(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) S(✓)

So the pattern is definitely _ R O _ S (positions 2,3,5 fixed as R,O,S respectively), and we have eliminated the letters: A,E,G,I,N,C,P.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has R in position 2
- has O in position 3
- has S in position 5
- uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A,E,G,I,N,C,P)

Looking at the remaining alphabet (B,D,F,H,J,K,L,M,Q,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and considering common English words, the most likely candidate is ""BROTS"" (but that's not a valid English word). 

Another possibility is ""FROST"" but F is allowed and T hasn't been eliminated. However, FROST has S in position 4, but our feedback shows S is in position 5. So ""FROST"" is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ R O _ S, so position 4 is open. Valid words fitting this pattern:
- BROKS (invalid)
- DROKS (invalid)
- FROKS (invalid)
- TROKS (invalid)

Actually, let me think of common words ending in ""RO_S"":
- BROTH (H is allowed)
- DROOL (but O is already in position 3)
- FRORE (E is eliminated)
- TROPE (P is eliminated)
- BROOD (D is allowed)
- TROOS (rare)
- BROSH (H is allowed)

""BROTH"" seems valid:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- T (allowed)
- H (allowed)

""BROOD"" is also possible:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- O (but we only have one O in the word based on feedback)
Wait, the feedback shows O is in position 3, so ""BROOD"" has O in position 3 and 4, which might not fit.

""BROSH"" is valid:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- S (but S is in position 5, not 4)
This doesn't fit _ R O _ S.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ S, so position 4 is any letter except the eliminated ones. Valid words:
- BROGS (invalid)
- BRONS (N is eliminated)
- BROOM (M is allowed, but O is already in position 3)
- BROWS (W is allowed)

""BROWS"" seems to fit perfectly:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- W (allowed)
- S (correct position)

All letters are allowed and it fits the pattern exactly.

- E: not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O _ S

We also know A and E are not in the word, so we can avoid those letters.

Good next guesses would test the remaining positions. Let's try a word that fits _ R O _ _ and includes S in position 5, as that would confirm S is at the end. A common word fitting this is ""FRONT"", but we'd need to check if F and T are allowed. Alternatively, ""GROIN"" or ""CROOK"" might fit, but we should pick one that tests new common letters.

Another approach is to test S in position 1 with a word like ""SROOK"" (but this isn't a valid word). Instead, let's try ""SWORD"" - but this has D which might be less common. 

A better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but O is already confirmed in position 3, so ""CROOK"" would have O in position 3 and 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - this has G, R, O, I, N. R and O are confirmed, and I and N are new letters. This would test positions 1, 4, 5.

But to directly test S in position 5, ""FRONT"" is _ R O _ N, but N is position 5. Wait, ""FRONT"" is F R O N T, but our pattern is _ R O _ _. So ""FRONT"" would be F R O N T, which doesn't fit.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 5 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

But maybe a better word is ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. But this has O in position 4, which might not fit. 

Let's try ""SWORD"" - S W O R D. But R is already in position 2, so this would be S W O R D, which doesn't fit _ R O _ _.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 1 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would test G, I, N. 

But to test S in position 1, a valid word is ""SROOK"" (but not valid). Instead, ""SWORD"" doesn't fit. 

Let's try ""CROOK"" - C R O O K. This has O in position 3 and 4, but we know O is only in position 3. So this is invalid.

Another approach is to test S in position 5 with a word like ""GROIN"" - but G R O I N is _ R O I N. This would test I and N. 

Actually, let's try ""GROIN"" as it fits _ R O _ _ and tests new letters. 

But a better choice might be ""CROOK"" - but as noted, it has O in position 4 which might not fit. 

Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. This would give us feedback on G, I, N. 

However, looking back, the pattern is _ R O _ _, so position 4 is open. Let's try ""GROIN"" - G R O I N. 

But ""GROIN"" is G R O I N, which fits _ R O _ _ (positions 2 and 3 are R and O). This would test G, I, N in positions 1, 4, 5. 

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- R is in position 2
- O is in position 3
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- A and E are not in the word

I'll test S in position 5 with the word ""GROIN"":

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: GROIN -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: _ R O _ _
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. GROIN → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - Confirms R in position 2 and O in position 3.
   - Eliminates G, I, N from the entire word.

Known letters:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- S must appear somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- Forbidden letters so far: A, E, G, I, N

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3
- Contains S (not in position 4)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- S R O _ _
- _ R O S _
- _ R O _ S

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ _ with S elsewhere:
- B R O S T
- C R O S S
- F R O S T
- P R O S T
- T R O S S
- W R O S T

Among these, ""FROST"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- F is still allowed
- R and O are in correct positions
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4) → so ""FROST"" is invalid
Wait, that contradicts our earlier finding that S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

Valid options:
- S R O _ _ : ""SROOK"" (invalid word)
- _ R O S _ : ""PROSE"" (but E is forbidden)
- _ R O _ S : ""CROCS"" (but C is allowed, but S is in position 5)

Looking again:
- B R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- C R O S S → S in position 4 (invalid)
- D R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- P R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)
- T R O S S → S in position 4 (invalid)
- W R O S T → S in position 4 (invalid)

So S must be in position 1 or 5. The only valid word I can see is:
- S R O _ _ : ""SROOK"" (invalid)
- _ R O _ S : ""CROPS"" (C, R, O, P, S) - all letters allowed

""CROPS"" fits:
- C (allowed)
- R in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed, and S is confirmed in word)

Thus, ""CROPS"" seems like the best next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
2. GROIN → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)
3. CROPS → C(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) S(✓)

So the pattern is definitely _ R O _ S (positions 2,3,5 fixed as R,O,S respectively), and we have eliminated the letters: A,E,G,I,N,C,P.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has R in position 2
- has O in position 3
- has S in position 5
- uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A,E,G,I,N,C,P)

Looking at the remaining alphabet (B,D,F,H,J,K,L,M,Q,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and considering common English words, the most likely candidate is ""BROTS"" (but that's not a valid English word). 

Another possibility is ""FROST"" but F is allowed and T hasn't been eliminated. However, FROST has S in position 4, but our feedback shows S is in position 5. So ""FROST"" is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ R O _ S, so position 4 is open. Valid words fitting this pattern:
- BROKS (invalid)
- DROKS (invalid)
- FROKS (invalid)
- TROKS (invalid)

Actually, let me think of common words ending in ""RO_S"":
- BROTH (H is allowed)
- DROOL (but O is already in position 3)
- FRORE (E is eliminated)
- TROPE (P is eliminated)
- BROOD (D is allowed)
- TROOS (rare)
- BROSH (H is allowed)

""BROTH"" seems valid:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- T (allowed)
- H (allowed)

""BROOD"" is also possible:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- O (but we only have one O in the word based on feedback)
Wait, the feedback shows O is in position 3, so ""BROOD"" has O in position 3 and 4, which might not fit.

""BROSH"" is valid:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- S (but S is in position 5, not 4)
This doesn't fit _ R O _ S.

Actually, the pattern is _ R O _ S, so position 4 is any letter except the eliminated ones. Valid words:
- BROGS (invalid)
- BRONS (N is eliminated)
- BROOM (M is allowed, but O is already in position 3)
- BROWS (W is allowed)

""BROWS"" seems to fit perfectly:
- B (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- W (allowed)
- S (correct position)

All letters are allowed and it fits the pattern exactly.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

2. Eliminated letters so far:  
   A, E, G, I, N, C, P, B

3. We need a single letter for position 1 that is **not** in the eliminated list and makes a valid 5-letter English word ending in “ROWS”.

Common first letters that fit and are still allowed:  
D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Scanning the dictionary for “?ROWS”:

- DROWS – valid  
- FROWS – archaic variant, not common  
- PROWS – P is eliminated  
- TROWS – not a standard word  
- WROWS – W is already in position 4
