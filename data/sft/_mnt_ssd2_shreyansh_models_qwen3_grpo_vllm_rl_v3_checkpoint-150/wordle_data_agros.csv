### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ARSON → A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)
   - A is in the correct position (position 1).
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O is in the correct position (position 4).
   - N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ O _
- Letters in word: A, R, S, O
- Letters not in word: L, T, E, N
- Positions to avoid:
  - S cannot be in position 1 or 3.
  - R cannot be in position 2.

Remaining possible letters (excluding known absent ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place R and S in the remaining positions (2 and 5) while respecting the constraints:
- Position 2 cannot be R (from ARSON feedback).
- Position 3 is already excluded for A (but A is already in position 1).
- Position 5 is open.

Possible placements:
- R must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in position 2 and positions 1,3,4 are taken by A, _, O).
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot for S, since it cannot be in 1 or 3).

Thus the word must be: A S _ O R.

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""ASPOR"" (but that's not a valid English word) or ""ASCOR"" (also invalid). Checking valid words, ""ASPOR"" isn't valid, but ""ASCOT"" is invalid due to T. 

Wait, let's list valid words matching A S _ O R:
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASPOR (invalid)
- ASCOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASGOR (invalid)

Hmm, none seem valid. Let me reconsider. Maybe R is in position 3? But position 3 is allowed for R since only S is restricted from there. 

But position 3 is allowed for R, but we have O in position 4. Let me think differently:

Current pattern: A _ _ O _
Letters left to place: R, S
Positions left: 2, 3, 5
Constraints:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 (from feedback), so S must be in 2 or 5.
- R cannot be in 2, so R must be in 3 or 5.

Possible combinations:
1. S in 2, R in 3: A S R O _
   - Then position 5 must be filled from remaining letters (not L,T,E,N). Possible: A S R O B, A S R O C, etc. ""ASROC"" isn't valid.
2. S in 2, R in 5: A S _ O R
   - Then position 3 must be filled. Valid word: A S C O R (ASCOR - invalid), A S P O R (ASPOR - invalid), A S K O R (ASKOR - invalid).
3. S in 5, R in 3: A _ R O S
   - Then position 2 must be filled. Valid word: A B R O S (ABROS - invalid), A C R O S (ACROS - invalid), A D R O S (ADROS - invalid), A F R O S (AFROS - invalid), A G R O S (AGROS - valid! ""AGROS"" is a valid word meaning a strip of land).

Thus, ""AGROS"" fits:
- A in 1 (correct)
- G in 2 (new letter)
- R in 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2)
- O in 4 (correct)
- S in 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 3)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 1
- O is confirmed in position 4
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, N

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>AGROS</guess>",AGROS,"From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ARSON → A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)
   - A is in the correct position (position 1).
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O is in the correct position (position 4).
   - N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ O _
- Letters in word: A, R, S, O
- Letters not in word: L, T, E, N
- Positions to avoid:
  - S cannot be in position 1 or 3.
  - R cannot be in position 2.

Remaining possible letters (excluding known absent ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place R and S in the remaining positions (2 and 5) while respecting the constraints:
- Position 2 cannot be R (from ARSON feedback).
- Position 3 is already excluded for A (but A is already in position 1).
- Position 5 is open.

Possible placements:
- R must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in position 2 and positions 1,3,4 are taken by A, _, O).
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot for S, since it cannot be in 1 or 3).

Thus the word must be: A S _ O R.

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""ASPOR"" (but that's not a valid English word) or ""ASCOR"" (also invalid). Checking valid words, ""ASPOR"" isn't valid, but ""ASCOT"" is invalid due to T. 

Wait, let's list valid words matching A S _ O R:
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASPOR (invalid)
- ASCOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASGOR (invalid)

Hmm, none seem valid. Let me reconsider. Maybe R is in position 3? But position 3 is allowed for R since only S is restricted from there. 

But position 3 is allowed for R, but we have O in position 4. Let me think differently:

Current pattern: A _ _ O _
Letters left to place: R, S
Positions left: 2, 3, 5
Constraints:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 (from feedback), so S must be in 2 or 5.
- R cannot be in 2, so R must be in 3 or 5.

Possible combinations:
1. S in 2, R in 3: A S R O _
   - Then position 5 must be filled from remaining letters (not L,T,E,N). Possible: A S R O B, A S R O C, etc. ""ASROC"" isn't valid.
2. S in 2, R in 5: A S _ O R
   - Then position 3 must be filled. Valid word: A S C O R (ASCOR - invalid), A S P O R (ASPOR - invalid), A S K O R (ASKOR - invalid).
3. S in 5, R in 3: A _ R O S
   - Then position 2 must be filled. Valid word: A B R O S (ABROS - invalid), A C R O S (ACROS - invalid), A D R O S (ADROS - invalid), A F R O S (AFROS - invalid), A G R O S (AGROS - valid! ""AGROS"" is a valid word meaning a strip of land).

Thus, ""AGROS"" fits:
- A in 1 (correct)
- G in 2 (new letter)
- R in 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2)
- O in 4 (correct)
- S in 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 3)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 1
- O is confirmed in position 4
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, N

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:",Guess 3: AGROS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(✓) R(✓) O(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
