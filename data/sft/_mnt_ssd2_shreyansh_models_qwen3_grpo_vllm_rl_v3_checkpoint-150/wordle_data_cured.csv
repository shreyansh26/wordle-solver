### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters. The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage. This should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Let's consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out (x): A, O, S, B, L, I, V  
Letters confirmed to be in the word: R, E (with E now fixed at position 4)  
Positions ruled out for R: 1, 2, 3  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

From DRIVE we also learned D(-) and E(-) – meaning D is in the word but not in position 1, and E is already fixed at 4.  
But we already knew E was in position 4 from REBEL, so the D(-) just tells us D is in the word but not in position 1.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Must contain: D (not in position 1)
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, B, L, I, V

Remaining unused common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need three letters for positions 1, 2, 3 that:
- Include D somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since position 1 is ruled out for D)
- Avoid all ruled-out letters

Let’s try to place D in position 2: _ D _ E R  
We need a letter for position 1 and 3 that are not in the banned set.

Possible candidates:

C D N E R → ""CDNER"" is not a valid English word.  
F D N E R → ""FDNER"" – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters. The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage. This should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters ruled out: A, O, S.  
Letters we know are in the word: R, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E.
- Does not contain A, O, or S.
- Places R somewhere other than position 2.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “REBEL”:
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain A, O, or S.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).

This should give us more information about the positions of R and E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4.
- Contains R somewhere other than positions 1 or 2.
- Does not contain A, O, S, B, or L.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2, and 4 is E).

Candidate words:
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Let’s try “TREND”:
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2 from AROSE). So TREND is invalid.

Try “CREPE”:
- E is in position 4 (✓).

Let's update everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, B, L, I, V, N

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
E (locked in position 4)  
R (must appear somewhere)  
D (must appear somewhere)  
U (must appear somewhere)

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: cannot be 1, 2, 3, 5 (from guesses 1,2,3,4) → R has no possible position left. This is impossible.
Wait, let's re-check each guess's position feedback carefully.

1. AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
2. REBEL: R(-) means R is in word but not position 1.
3. DRIVE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
4. UNDER: R(-) means R is in word but not position 5.

So R is forbidden at positions 1, 2, 5. With E fixed at 4, the only remaining spot for R is position 3.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ R E _

Letters still required:
- D must be present (from DRIVE and UNDER feedback) and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (positions 1: U(-), 3: R, 4: E, 5: R is already placed but R and D could both be in 3? Wait no, R is in 3). So D must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ D R E _

Letters left to fill position 1: must be a letter not yet ruled out, and must form a valid 5-letter word ending in DRE_.

Possible first letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- C D R E _ → C D R E W (CDREW - not a word)
- T D R E _ → T D R E W (T D R E W = T R E W? No)
- F D R E _ → F D R E S (FDRES - no)
- H D R E _ → H D R E S (HDR ES - no)
- M D R E _ → M D R E S (MDRES - no)
- G D R E _ → G D R E S (G D R E S - no)
- P D R E _ → P D R E S (P D R E S - no)
- W D R E _ → W D R E S (W D R E S - no)
- Y D R E _ → Y D R E S (Y D R E S - no)

Wait, let's think differently - the word must be _ D R E _ with D in 2, R in 3, E in 4, and U must be present somewhere. But U was only confirmed in UNDER as U(-), meaning U is in the word but not position 1. So U must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ D R E U

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word matching this pattern. The only common word is:

C D R E U → ""C D R E U"" - not a word  
F D R E U - no  
G D R E U - no  
H D R E U - no  
M D R E U - no  
P D R E U - no  
T D R E U - no  
W D R E U - no  
Y D R E U - no  

But ""D R E W S"" is a word, but that doesn't fit. Wait, the pattern is _ D R E U. The only valid English word fitting this is ""C D R E U"" which doesn't exist. This suggests an inconsistency - we must have made an error.

Re-examining:
From UNDER: U(-) means U is in word but not position 1.  
We have positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: 4=E, must have R and D, and U.

If R must be in position 3 (only remaining), and E in 4, then positions 1,2,5 must contain D and U.

Possible arrangements:
- Position 1: D or U  
- Position 2: must be a letter (but we have only D and U left to place)  
- Position 5: must be a letter  

But we need to place D and U in positions 1,2,5. Let's list possibilities:

Pattern: _ _ R E _

Letters to place: D, U

Possible permutations:
1. D U R E _ → D U R E ? But we need 5 letters, so D U R E _ with U in 1 or 2 or 5.  
   Actually positions are 1 2 3 4 5, with 3=R, 4=E.

So possible:
- Position 1: D or U  
- Position 2: must be one of the remaining (D or U) or another letter? But we've only confirmed D and U are in word, and E is in 4, R in 3. The other letters could be any not ruled out.

But we have to use valid English words. Let's think of words with R in 3 and E in 4, containing D and U.

Examples:
- D U R E _ → D U R E ? No common word.  
- _ D R E U → C D R E U - no  
- _ U R E D → C U R E D (CURED) - yes! C U R E D

Check CURED:
- Letters: C, U, R, E, D  
- C not ruled out.  
- U is in word (from UNDER) and not in position 1 (it's in 2) - OK  
- R is in position 3 - OK (only remaining spot)  
- E is in 4 - OK  
- D is in 5 - OK (D was in UNDER at position 3 with -, so D can be in 5)  

CURED is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

U (must appear somewhere)

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: cannot be 1, 2, 3, 5 (from guesses 1,2,3,4) → R has no possible position left. This is impossible.
Wait, let's re-check each guess's position feedback carefully.

1. AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
2. REBEL: R(-) means R is in word but not position 1.
3. DRIVE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
4. UNDER: R(-) means R is in word but not position 5.

So R is forbidden at positions 1, 2, 5. With E fixed at 4, the only remaining spot for R is position 3.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ R E _

Letters still required:
- D must be present (from DRIVE and UNDER feedback) and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (positions 1: U(-), 3: R, 4: E, 5: R is already placed but R and D could both be in 3? Wait no, R is in 3). So D must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ D R E _

Letters left to fill position 1: must be a letter not yet ruled out, and must form a valid 5-letter word ending in DRE_.

Possible first letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- C D R E _ → C D R E W (CDREW - not a word)
- T D R E _ → T D R E W (T D R E W = T R E W? No)
- F D R E _ → F D R E S (FDRES - no)
- H D R E _ → H D R E S (HDR ES - no)
- M D R E _ → M D R E S (MDRES - no)
- G D R E _ → G D R E S (G D R E S - no)
- P D R E _ → P D R E S (P D R E S - no)
- W D R E _ → W D R E S (W D R E S - no)
- Y D R E _ → Y D R E S (Y D R E S - no)

Wait, let's think differently - the word must be _ D R E _ with D in 2, R in 3, E in 4, and U must be present somewhere. But U was only confirmed in UNDER as U(-), meaning U is in the word but not position 1. So U must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ D R E U

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word matching this pattern. The only common word is:

C D R E U → ""C D R E U"" - not a word  
F D R E U - no  
G D R E U - no  
H D R E U - no  
M D R E U - no  
P D R E U - no  
T D R E U - no  
W D R E U - no  
Y D R E U - no  

But ""D R E W S"" is a word, but that doesn't fit. Wait, the pattern is _ D R E U. The only valid English word fitting this is ""C D R E U"" which doesn't exist. This suggests an inconsistency - we must have made an error.

Re-examining:
From UNDER: U(-) means U is in word but not position 1.  
We have positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: 4=E, must have R and D, and U.

If R must be in position 3 (only remaining), and E in 4, then positions 1,2,5 must contain D and U.

Possible arrangements:
- Position 1: D or U  
- Position 2: must be a letter (but we have only D and U left to place)  
- Position 5: must be a letter  

But we need to place D and U in positions 1,2,5. Let's list possibilities:

Pattern: _ _ R E _

Letters to place: D, U

Possible permutations:
1. D U R E _ → D U R E ? But we need 5 letters, so D U R E _ with U in 1 or 2 or 5.  
   Actually positions are 1 2 3 4 5, with 3=R, 4=E.

So possible:
- Position 1: D or U  
- Position 2: must be one of the remaining (D or U) or another letter? But we've only confirmed D and U are in word, and E is in 4, R in 3. The other letters could be any not ruled out.

But we have to use valid English words. Let's think of words with R in 3 and E in 4, containing D and U.

Examples:
- D U R E _ → D U R E ? No common word.  
- _ D R E U → C D R E U - no  
- _ U R E D → C U R E D (CURED) - yes! C U R E D

Check CURED:
- Letters: C, U, R, E, D  
- C not ruled out.  
- U is in word (from UNDER) and not in position 1 (it's in 2) - OK  
- R is in position 3 - OK (only remaining spot)  
- E is in 4 - OK  
- D is in 5 - OK (D was in UNDER at position 3 with -, so D can be in 5)  

CURED is a valid English word and fits all constraints.",Guess 5: CURED -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
