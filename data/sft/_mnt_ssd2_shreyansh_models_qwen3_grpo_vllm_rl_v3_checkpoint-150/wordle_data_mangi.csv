For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
- All letters are among the most common in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong next guess would be a word that uses A in positions 2-5, plus common consonants and the other vowels. ""ADMIT"" is a good candidate:
- A in position 2 (valid since A can't be first).
- Uses D, M, I, T which are all common and haven't been ruled out.
- Contains the second vowel I, giving information about that vowel.

   - A is again marked (-), confirming it is in the word but not in position 1 (consistent).
   - D and T are not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, M, I.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, D, T.
- A is not in position 1.
- M is not in position 3.
- I is not in position 4.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, M, I.
- Avoids positions 1 for A, 3 for M, 4 for I.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for M: 1, 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5.

A good candidate is ""AMCIG"" but that's not a valid word. Let me think of real words.

""CLAIM"" - but T is excluded, and this has L, C, A, I, M. Let's check:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 5 (allowed).
- I is in position 4 (but I cannot be in position 4 from feedback). So ""CLAIM"" is invalid.

""IMMAN"" - but this has M in position 3 which is invalid.

""MINCA"" - but this has A in position 5, M in position 1, I in position 2. This seems valid:
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

But ""MINCA"" is not a common word. Let me try ""ACIMB"" - no, this isn't valid either.

""AMIBS"" - but S is excluded.

""AMICA"" - this is a valid word (a type of lily), and:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 3 (but M cannot be in position 3 from feedback). So invalid.

""ACIMA"" - but this is not a valid word.

""MACAW"" - but W is allowed, and:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- C and W are new letters from allowed set.

""MACAW"" seems valid and uses all known letters (A, M, I) plus two new allowed letters (C, W).

Let me check positions:
- A is in position 2 (not 1) - OK.

- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- C and W are new letters from allowed set.

""MACAW"" seems valid and uses all known letters (A, M, I) plus two new allowed letters (C, W).

- M is in position 1 (not 3) - OK.
- I is in position 3 (not 4) - OK.
- C and W are new and allowed - OK.

Thus, ""MACAW"" is a good next guess.

- Does NOT have A in positions 1 or 4 (from feedback).
- Must contain I (from ADMIT feedback) somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, but position 4 is already excluded for A and not confirmed for I.

Possible remaining letters (excluding ruled-out ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus I.

We need a 5-letter word that:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
- All letters are among the most common in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong next guess would be a word that uses A in positions 2-5, plus common consonants and the other vowels. ""ADMIT"" is a good candidate:
- A in position 2 (valid since A can't be first).
- Uses D, M, I, T which are all common and haven't been ruled out.
- Contains the second vowel I, giving information about that vowel.

From the two guesses so far:

   - M and I are in the word but in wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, M, I.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, D, T.
- A is not in position 1.
- M is not in position 3.
- I is not in position 4.

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the ruled-out ones).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, M, I.
- Avoids positions 1 for A, 3 for M, 4 for I.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for M: 1, 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5.

A good candidate is ""AMCIG"" but that's not a valid word. Let me think of real words.

""CLAIM"" - but T is excluded, and this has L, C, A, I, M. Let's check:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 5 (allowed).
- I is in position 4 (but I cannot be in position 4 from feedback). So ""CLAIM"" is invalid.

""IMMAN"" - but this has M in position 3 which is invalid.

""MINCA"" - but this has A in position 5, M in position 1, I in position 2. This seems valid:
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

But ""MINCA"" is not a common word. Let me try ""ACIMB"" - no, this isn't valid either.

""AMIBS"" - but S is excluded.

""AMICA"" - this is a valid word (a type of lily), and:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 3 (but M cannot be in position 3 from feedback). So invalid.

""ACIMA"" - but this is not a valid word.

""MACAW"" - but W is allowed, and:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- C and W are new letters from allowed set.

""MACAW"" seems valid and uses all known letters (A, M, I) plus two new allowed letters (C, W).

Let me check positions:
- A is in position 2 (not 1) - OK.
- M is in position 1 (not 3) - OK.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word pattern is M A _ _ _ (positions 1 and 2 locked).
2. The letters R, O, S, E, D, T, C, W, K are **not** in the word.
3. The letters **I** must appear somewhere in the remaining three positions (3, 4, or 5), because:
   - In ADMIT, I was marked (-) → I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - In MAKIN, I was marked (-) → I is in the word but not in position 4 (again) and also not in position 3.
   - Therefore I must be in position 5.

4. The remaining two positions (3 and 4) must be filled with letters **not** yet ruled out.
   Allowed letters (excluding all excluded ones): B, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Starts with M A
   - Has I in position 5
   - Uses only allowed letters in positions 3 and 4
   - Is a valid English word

Possible patterns: M A _ _ I

Scanning common words:
- M A B _ I → ""MABII"" invalid (double B, not a word)
- M A F _ I → ""MAFII"" invalid
- M A G _ I → ""MAGII"" invalid
- M A H _ I → ""MAHII"" invalid
- M A L _ I → ""MALII"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANII"" invalid
- M A P _ I → ""MAPPI"" invalid
- M A V _ I → ""MAVII"" invalid
- M A B B I → ""MABBI"" invalid
- M A L L I → ""MALLI"" invalid
- M A N N I → ""MANNI"" invalid
- M A H A I → ""MAHAI"" invalid
- M A L I → too short
- M A N I → too short
- M A V I → too short

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be M A _ _ I and valid. The only common English word that fits is:

M A L I C → but C is excluded  
M A J I D → D is excluded  
M A H I D → D is excluded  
M A N I A → A already in position 2, and A cannot be in position 5 (from MAKIN feedback: N was (-), so N is in word but not in position 4; but this is separate)  
M A N I K → K is excluded  
M A L I K → K is excluded  
M A J I T → T is excluded  
M A H I L → L allowed  
M A H I L → ""MAHIL"" is not a standard word  
M A L I N → N allowed, ""MALIN"" is a proper noun but appears in dictionaries as a surname

However, ""MALIN"" is not standard. The only valid common word is:

M A N I A → but N is allowed (from MAKIN: N was (-) → N is in word but not in position 4) and A is allowed in position 5?  
Wait, from MAKIN: N was (-) → N is in word but not in position 4. From AROSE: A cannot be in position 1 or 4. A can be in 2, 3, or 5. Position 2 is already A. So A could be in 3 or 5. But position 5 must be I (from I analysis). Therefore A cannot be in position 3 either (since position 2 is A). This suggests our earlier conclusion that I must be in position 5 is correct, leaving positions 3 and 4 to be filled with non-A letters.

Rechecking allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- M A B L I → ""MABLI"" invalid
- M A B N I → ""MABNI"" invalid
- M A F L I → ""MAFLI"" invalid
- M A G L I → ""MAGLI"" invalid
- M A H L I → ""MAHIL"" invalid
- M A J L I → ""MAJLI"" invalid
- M A L N I → ""MALNI"" invalid
- M A N L I → ""MANLI"" invalid
- M A P N I → ""MAPNI"" invalid
- M A V N I → ""MAVNI"" invalid

This suggests we might have missed a word. Let me reconsider the I placement.

From MAKIN: I was (-) → I is in word but not in position 4. From ADMIT: I was (-) → not in position 4. So I must be in position 3 or 5.

From MACAW: second A was (-) → A is not in position 4 (already known). From AROSE: A is not in position 1. From ADMIT: A is not in position 1 (already). So A could be in position 2, 3, or 5. Position 2 is A (✓), so A could be in 3 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
- M A I _ _ → but then I is in position 3, leaving positions 4 and 5 to be filled with non-A, non-excluded letters. The word would be M A I _ _ I (but this would require 6 letters) - no, this suggests I could be in position 3 or 5.

Let's try I in position 3:
Pattern: M A I _ _
Need valid 5-letter words: M A I _ _
- M A I Z E → E excluded  
- M A I N S → S excluded  
- M A I L S → S excluded  
- M A I L Y → Y allowed, ""MAILY"" is archaic but valid  
- M A I N E → E excluded  
- M A I N T → T excluded  

""MAILY"" is the closest valid word.

Let's check constraints:
- M A I L Y:
  - Position 1: M ✓
  - Position 2: A ✓
  - Position 3: I (must be here or 5, and this fits)
  - Position 4: L (allowed)
  - Position 5: Y (allowed)
- Contains I (from ADMIT and MAKIN feedback)
- Does not contain any excluded letters
- Is a valid English word (archaic but recognized)

Thus, ""MAILY"" is the correct next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
- All letters are among the most common in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong next guess would be a word that uses A in positions 2-5, plus common consonants and the other vowels. ""ADMIT"" is a good candidate:
- A in position 2 (valid since A can't be first).
- Uses D, M, I, T which are all common and haven't been ruled out.
- Contains the second vowel I, giving information about that vowel.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. ADMIT → A(-) D(x) M(-) I(-) T(x)
   - A is again marked (-), confirming it is in the word but not in position 1 (consistent).
   - D and T are not in the word.
   - M and I are in the word but in wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, M, I.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, D, T.
- A is not in position 1.
- M is not in position 3.
- I is not in position 4.

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the ruled-out ones).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, M, I.
- Avoids positions 1 for A, 3 for M, 4 for I.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for M: 1, 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5.

A good candidate is ""AMCIG"" but that's not a valid word. Let me think of real words.

""CLAIM"" - but T is excluded, and this has L, C, A, I, M. Let's check:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 5 (allowed).
- I is in position 4 (but I cannot be in position 4 from feedback). So ""CLAIM"" is invalid.

""IMMAN"" - but this has M in position 3 which is invalid.

""MINCA"" - but this has A in position 5, M in position 1, I in position 2. This seems valid:
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

But ""MINCA"" is not a common word. Let me try ""ACIMB"" - no, this isn't valid either.

""AMIBS"" - but S is excluded.

""AMICA"" - this is a valid word (a type of lily), and:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 3 (but M cannot be in position 3 from feedback). So invalid.

""ACIMA"" - but this is not a valid word.

""MACAW"" - but W is allowed, and:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- C and W are new letters from allowed set.

""MACAW"" seems valid and uses all known letters (A, M, I) plus two new allowed letters (C, W).

Let me check positions:
- A is in position 2 (not 1) - OK.
- M is in position 1 (not 3) - OK.
- I is in position 3 (not 4) - OK.
- C and W are new and allowed - OK.

Thus, ""MACAW"" is a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

Guess 3: MACAW -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) C(x) A(-) W(x)
<|im_end|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. ADMIT → A(-) D(x) M(-) I(-) T(x)
   - A is again (-), confirming it is in the word but not in position 1.
   - D and T are not in the word.
   - M and I are in the word but in wrong positions.

3. MACAW → M(✓) A(✓) C(x) A(-) W(x)
   - M is in position 1 and correct (✓).
   - A is in position 2 and correct (✓).
   - C and W are not in the word.
   - The second A in position 4 is marked (-), confirming A is not in position 4 (consistent with earlier feedback).

So the secret word:
- Starts with M A _ _ _ (positions 1 and 2 are correct).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, D, T, C, W.
- Does NOT have A in positions 1 or 4 (from feedback).
- Must contain I (from ADMIT feedback) somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, but position 4 is already excluded for A and not confirmed for I.

Possible remaining letters (excluding ruled-out ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with M A _ _ _.
- Contains I somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns: MA I _ _, MA _ I _, MA _ _ I.

Looking for common words:
- MAI _ _: ""MAIZE"" but Z is allowed, E is excluded. ""MAIZE"" is invalid (E excluded).
- MA _ I _: ""MAPIN"" (but N is allowed), ""MANGI"" (but G is allowed), ""MAKIN"" (K is allowed), ""MALIC"" (C is excluded).
- MA _ _ I: ""MAJJI"" (but J is allowed), ""MAKIN"" (K is allowed), ""MALIN"" (L is allowed).

""MAKIN"" seems valid:
- Starts with MA.
- Contains I in position 4.
- Uses K and N which are allowed.

But let's check ""MALIC"" - C is excluded.

""MAJIN"" - but J is allowed, but is this a valid word? Not common.

""MAKIN"" is actually a valid word (a type of fish or a verb form).

However, ""MALIC"" is invalid due to C.

Another option: ""MAHIN"" - but H is allowed, but this isn't a common word.

""MAFIN"" - but F is allowed, but this isn't a common word.

""MAVIN"" - but V is allowed, but this isn't a common word.

""MAZIN"" - Z is allowed, but this isn't a common word.

""MAKIN"" seems the best available.

But let me think of more common words: ""MAIZE"" is invalid (E excluded), ""MALIC"" invalid (C excluded).

Actually, ""MAKIN"" might be obscure. Let me reconsider.

Alternative: ""MAJIN"" - but this is rare.

""MAFIN"" - no.

""MAHIN"" - no.

""MAVIN"" - no.

""MAZIN"" - no.

""MAKIN"" seems to be the only plausible option here.

But wait, let me check ""MAJIN"" - is this a valid word? It appears to be a variant spelling or proper noun, likely invalid.

""MAKIN"" is actually listed as a valid word (Scrabble dictionary, etc.).

Thus, ""MAKIN"" is the best next guess.

But let me verify positions:
- M A K I N:
  - Position 1: M ✓
  - Position 2: A ✓
  - Position 3: K (new, allowed)
  - Position 4: I (must be here or 5, but 4 is possible)
  - Position 5: N (allowed)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with MA (positions 1 and 2 confirmed).
- Must contain I (from ADMIT feedback) and cannot have A in position 4.
- Cannot contain C, W, R, O, S, E, D, T.

The only plausible 5-letter word fitting these constraints is:

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word pattern is M A _ _ _ (positions 1 and 2 locked).
2. The letters R, O, S, E, D, T, C, W, K are **not** in the word.
3. The letters **I** must appear somewhere in the remaining three positions (3, 4, or 5), because:
   - In ADMIT, I was marked (-) → I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - In MAKIN, I was marked (-) → I is in the word but not in position 4 (again) and also not in position 3.
   - Therefore I must be in position 5.

4. The remaining two positions (3 and 4) must be filled with letters **not** yet ruled out.
   Allowed letters (excluding all excluded ones): B, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Starts with M A
   - Has I in position 5
   - Uses only allowed letters in positions 3 and 4
   - Is a valid English word

Possible patterns: M A _ _ I

Scanning common words:
- M A B _ I → ""MABII"" invalid (double B, not a word)
- M A F _ I → ""MAFII"" invalid
- M A G _ I → ""MAGII"" invalid
- M A H _ I → ""MAHII"" invalid
- M A L _ I → ""MALII"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANII"" invalid
- M A P _ I → ""MAPPI"" invalid
- M A V _ I → ""MAVII"" invalid
- M A B B I → ""MABBI"" invalid
- M A L L I → ""MALLI"" invalid
- M A N N I → ""MANNI"" invalid
- M A H A I → ""MAHAI"" invalid
- M A L I → too short
- M A N I → too short
- M A V I → too short

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be M A _ _ I and valid. The only common English word that fits is:

M A L I C → but C is excluded  
M A J I D → D is excluded  
M A H I D → D is excluded  
M A N I A → A already in position 2, and A cannot be in position 5 (from MAKIN feedback: N was (-), so N is in word but not in position 4; but this is separate)  
M A N I K → K is excluded  
M A L I K → K is excluded  
M A J I T → T is excluded  
M A H I L → L allowed  
M A H I L → ""MAHIL"" is not a standard word  
M A L I N → N allowed, ""MALIN"" is a proper noun but appears in dictionaries as a surname

However, ""MALIN"" is not standard. The only valid common word is:

M A N I A → but N is allowed (from MAKIN: N was (-) → N is in word but not in position 4) and A is allowed in position 5?  
Wait, from MAKIN: N was (-) → N is in word but not in position 4. From AROSE: A cannot be in position 1 or 4. A can be in 2, 3, or 5. Position 2 is already A. So A could be in 3 or 5. But position 5 must be I (from I analysis). Therefore A cannot be in position 3 either (since position 2 is A). This suggests our earlier conclusion that I must be in position 5 is correct, leaving positions 3 and 4 to be filled with non-A letters.

Rechecking allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- M A B L I → ""MABLI"" invalid
- M A B N I → ""MABNI"" invalid
- M A F L I → ""MAFLI"" invalid
- M A G L I → ""MAGLI"" invalid
- M A H L I → ""MAHIL"" invalid
- M A J L I → ""MAJLI"" invalid
- M A L N I → ""MALNI"" invalid
- M A N L I → ""MANLI"" invalid
- M A P N I → ""MAPNI"" invalid
- M A V N I → ""MAVNI"" invalid

This suggests we might have missed a word. Let me reconsider the I placement.

From MAKIN: I was (-) → I is in word but not in position 4. From ADMIT: I was (-) → not in position 4. So I must be in position 3 or 5.

From MACAW: second A was (-) → A is not in position 4 (already known). From AROSE: A is not in position 1. From ADMIT: A is not in position 1 (already). So A could be in position 2, 3, or 5. Position 2 is A (✓), so A could be in 3 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
- M A I _ _ → but then I is in position 3, leaving positions 4 and 5 to be filled with non-A, non-excluded letters. The word would be M A I _ _ I (but this would require 6 letters) - no, this suggests I could be in position 3 or 5.

Let's try I in position 3:
Pattern: M A I _ _
Need valid 5-letter words: M A I _ _
- M A I Z E → E excluded  
- M A I N S → S excluded  
- M A I L S → S excluded  
- M A I L Y → Y allowed, ""MAILY"" is archaic but valid  
- M A I N E → E excluded  
- M A I N T → T excluded  

""MAILY"" is the closest valid word.

Let's check constraints:
- M A I L Y:
  - Position 1: M ✓
  - Position 2: A ✓
  - Position 3: I (must be here or 5, and this fits)
  - Position 4: L (allowed)
  - Position 5: Y (allowed)
- Contains I (from ADMIT and MAKIN feedback)
- Does not contain any excluded letters
- Is a valid English word (archaic but recognized)

Thus, ""MAILY"" is the correct next guess.

From the five rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. ADMIT → A(-) D(x) M(-) I(-) T(x)
   - A is again (-), confirming it is in the word but not in position 1.
   - D and T are not in the word.
   - M and I are in the word but in wrong positions.

3. MACAW → M(✓) A(✓) C(x) A(-) W(x)
   - M is in position 1 and correct (✓).
   - A is in position 2 and correct (✓).
   - C and W are not in the word.
   - The second A in position 4 is marked (-), confirming A is not in position 4.

4. MAKIN → M(✓) A(✓) K(x) I(-) N(-)
   - M and A are correctly placed in positions 1 and 2.
   - K is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

5. MAILY → M(✓) A(✓) I(-) L(x) Y(x)
   - M and A are correctly placed in positions 1 and 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L and Y are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: M A _ _ _
- Letters in word: M, A, I, N (from MAKIN: N is in word but not in position 5)
- Letters not in word: R, O, S, E, D, T, C, W, K, L, Y
- Positions:
  - Position 1: M (fixed)
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 3: I is in word but not here (from MAKIN and MAILY) → I must be in position 4 or 5
  - Position 4: N is in word but not here (from MAKIN) → N must be in position 3 or 5
  - Position 5: N is not here (from MAKIN) and I could be here

Possible positions for I and N:
- If I is in position 4, then N must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 cannot have N (from MAKIN), so N must be in position 3.
- If I is in position 5, then N must be in position 3 (since position 4 cannot have N).

Thus possible patterns:
1. M A N I _
2. M A N _ I

But position 5 must be a letter not yet excluded. From remaining letters (not in excluded list): B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- M A N I _ → ""MANIC"" but C is excluded
- M A N I B → ""MANIB"" invalid
- M A N I F → ""MANIF"" invalid
- M A N I G → ""MANIG"" invalid
- M A N I H → ""MANIH"" invalid
- M A N I J → ""MANIJ"" invalid
- M A N I P → ""MANIP"" invalid
- M A N I Q → ""MANIQ"" invalid
- M A N I U → ""MANIU"" invalid
- M A N I V → ""MANIV"" invalid
- M A N I X → ""MANIX"" invalid
- M A N I Z → ""MANIZ"" invalid

- M A N _ I → ""MANBI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANGI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANHI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANPI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANQI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANRI"" invalid (R excluded)
- M A N _ I → ""MANSI"" invalid (S excluded)
- M A N _ I → ""MANUI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANVI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANXI"" invalid
- M A N _ I → ""MANZI"" invalid

This suggests we might have missed a word. Let me reconsider:

From feedback, N is in word but not in position 5 (from MAKIN). I is in word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from MAILY and MAKIN), so I must be in position 5.

Thus pattern: M A _ _ I

Now positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters from remaining allowed: B, F, G, H, J, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Also, N is in word but not in position 5, so N must be in position 3 or 4.

Thus possible patterns:
- M A N _ I
- M A _ N I

Looking for valid words:
- M A N _ I → ""MANCI"" invalid (C excluded), ""MANFI"" invalid, ""MANGI"" invalid (G allowed but ""MANGI"" is a word - let's check)
  - ""MANGI"" is valid (a type of plant)
- M A _ N I → ""MAPNI"" invalid, ""MAUNI"" invalid, ""MAVIN"" invalid (V allowed but ""MAVIN"" is a word)

Between ""MANGI"" and ""MAVIN"":
- ""MANGI"" fits M A N _ I pattern, uses N in position 3, I in 5
- ""MAVIN"" fits M A _ N I pattern, uses V in position 3, N in 4, I in 5

But N must be in word, and ""MAVIN"" has N in position 4 which is allowed (since MAKIN said N is not in position 5, but position 4 is open).

However, ""MAVIN"" is a valid word and uses V (allowed) and N (must be in word).

Let me verify:
- M A V N I:
  - M A ✓ ✓
  - V allowed
  - N in position 4 (allowed, since MAKIN said N is not in position 5)
  - I in position 5 (allowed, since I must be in word and positions 1,2,3,4 are excluded for I)

Thus ""MAVIN"" is a valid guess.

From all feedback, the only remaining valid placement is M A _ N I, and the only common word fitting is:

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: M A _ _ _
- Letters in word: M, A, I, N (from MAKIN: N is in word but not in position 5)
- Letters not in word: R, O, S, E, D, T, C, W, K, L, Y
- Positions:
  - Position 1: M (fixed)

  - Position 3: I is in word but not here (from MAKIN and MAILY) → I must be in position 4 or 5
  - Position 4: N is in word but not here (from MAKIN) → N must be in position 3 or 5
  - Position 5: N is not here (from MAKIN) and I could be here

Possible positions for I and N:
- If I is in position 4, then N must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 cannot have N (from MAKIN), so N must be in position 3.
- If I is in position 5, then N must be in position 3 (since position 4 cannot have N).

Thus possible patterns:
1. M A N I _
2. M A N _ I

But position 5 must be a letter not yet excluded. From remaining letters (not in excluded list): B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

This suggests we might have missed a word. Let me reconsider:

From feedback, N is in word but not in position 5 (from MAKIN). I is in word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from MAILY and MAKIN), so I must be in position 5.

Thus pattern: M A _ _ I

Now positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters from remaining allowed: B, F, G, H, J, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Also, N is in word but not in position 5, so N must be in position 3 or 4.

Thus possible patterns:

Looking for valid words:
- M A N _ I → ""MANCI"" invalid (C excluded), ""MANFI"" invalid, ""MANGI"" invalid (G allowed but ""MANGI"" is a word - let's check)

- M A _ N I → ""MAPNI"" invalid, ""MAUNI"" invalid, ""MAVIN"" invalid (V allowed but ""MAVIN"" is a word)

Between ""MANGI"" and ""MAVIN"":
- ""MANGI"" fits M A N _ I pattern, uses N in position 3, I in 5
- ""MAVIN"" fits M A _ N I pattern, uses V in position 3, N in 4, I in 5

But N must be in word, and ""MAVIN"" has N in position 4 which is allowed (since MAKIN said N is not in position 5, but position 4 is open).

However, ""MAVIN"" is a valid word and uses V (allowed) and N (must be in word).

Let me verify:
- M A V N I:
  - M A ✓ ✓
  - V allowed
  - N in position 4 (allowed, since MAKIN said N is not in position 5)
  - I in position 5 (allowed, since I must be in word and positions 1,2,3,4 are excluded for I)

Thus ""MAVIN"" is a valid guess.
