For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common. This will give us information about 5 different letters and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because O is a very common vowel and R is a common consonant.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. No O, S, E anywhere.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing R but not in position 2, and avoiding O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding O, S, E).

Let me think of words starting with A, with R not in position 2:
- A R _ _ _ (invalid, R can't be position 2)
- A _ R _ _
- A _ _ R _
- A _ _ _ R

Good candidates:
- A _ R _ _: A B R A N, A C R I D, A F R A I, A G R I D, A H R A N, A I R D R, A L R I D, A M R I D, A N R I D, A P R I D, A T R I D, A V R I D
- A _ _ R _: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R

Looking at these, ""ABRIR"" comes to mind (though it's Spanish for open, not English). In English, ""ABACK"" has A B A C K, but C is allowed. However, ""ABACK"" has A in position 2 and 3, which might not be optimal.

Better options:
- ""ABASE"" - but E is excluded.
- ""ABASH"" - S is excluded.
- ""ABIDE"" - E is excluded.
- ""ABIRI"" - not a valid word.
- ""ABORT"" - O is excluded.
- ""ABRUT"" - not a valid word.

Looking at ""A _ R _ _"":
- ""ACRID"" - A C R I D: C, I, D are allowed. This seems good.
- ""AFRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""AGRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""ALARM"" - has A in position 2, which is fine since R isn't there, but A is repeated.
- ""AMBER"" - B, M, E, R: E is excluded.
- ""ANTHR"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ R _"":
- ""ADHAR"" - D, H, A, R: but A is in position 2, which is allowed since R isn't there. However, H is allowed.
- ""ADMIT"" - M, I, T: but R isn't in this word.
- ""AGARW"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ _ R"":
- ""ADMIT"" - doesn't have R.
- ""AGONY"" - O, N, Y: O is excluded.
- ""ALARM"" - has R in position 4, but A is repeated.

Best valid English word seems ""ACRID"" - A C R I D. It starts with A, has R in position 3 (not 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Let me verify:
- A: correct position 1.
- C: new letter.
- R: in word, not in position 2 (it's in 3), so possible.
- I: new letter.
- D: new letter.

This seems optimal for the second guess.

   - A(✓) again confirms position 1.  
   - C, I, D are not in the word at all.  
   - R(✓) now shows R is in position 3.

So the word pattern is:
A _ R _ _

Letters still allowed: all consonants and vowels except O, S, E, C, I, D.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5.  
To maximize information, pick a word that uses two new, frequent letters in those slots.

Good candidates:
- A B R A N → uses B and N (but repeats A, which is already known).
- A F R A N → uses F and N.
- A G R A N → uses G and N.
- A H R A N → uses H and N.
- A M R A N → uses M and N.
- A N R A N → uses N twice (not ideal).

""AGRAN"" is also not valid.  
""AMRAN"" is not a word.  
""APRAN"" is not a word.  
""ATRAN"" is not a word.

Next, try consonants + vowel combinations.  
Allowed vowels left: U (since A is already used in position 1, and we've excluded O, E, I).

So position 2 could be a consonant, position 5 could be a consonant or U.

Let's try:
- A B R U N → ""ABRUN"" – not a word.
- A F R U N → ""AFRUN"" – not a word.
- A G R U N → ""AGRUN"" – not a word.
- A H R U N → ""AHRUN"" – not a word.
- A M R U N → ""AMRUN"" – not a word.
- A P R U N → ""APRUN"" – not a word.
- A T R U N → ""ATRUN"" – not a word.

Try swapping U with another consonant:
- A B R A N – already considered.
- A B R K N – ""ABRKN"" – not a word.

Let's try ""AUGUR"" – but U is the only allowed vowel, and it repeats U, which is acceptable but might not help much.

Actually, ""AUGUR"" is an archaic word, but it's valid. It uses:
A(✓) U G U R – but position 3 is R, so it would be A U R _ _ – no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is A _ R _ _. So we need:
A [letter 2] R [letter 4] [letter 5]

Let's try:
- A F R A N – ""AFRAN"" – not valid.
- A F R A M – ""AFRAM"" – not valid.
- A F R A Y – ""AFRAY"" – this is a valid word (past tense of ""afire"").

""AFRAY"":
- A(✓) F R A Y
- Uses F and Y, both new letters.
- A is in position 1 (known).
- R is in position 3 (known from feedback).
- A is also in position 4 – this is acceptable since we only know R isn't in position 2, and we're testing F and Y.

This seems like the best next guess to test F and Y in positions 2 and 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common. This will give us information about 5 different letters and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because O is a very common vowel and R is a common consonant.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. No O, S, E anywhere.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing R but not in position 2, and avoiding O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding O, S, E).

Let me think of words starting with A, with R not in position 2:
- A R _ _ _ (invalid, R can't be position 2)
- A _ R _ _
- A _ _ R _
- A _ _ _ R

Good candidates:
- A _ R _ _: A B R A N, A C R I D, A F R A I, A G R I D, A H R A N, A I R D R, A L R I D, A M R I D, A N R I D, A P R I D, A T R I D, A V R I D
- A _ _ R _: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R
- A _ _ _ R: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R

Looking at these, ""ABRIR"" comes to mind (though it's Spanish for open, not English). In English, ""ABACK"" has A B A C K, but C is allowed. However, ""ABACK"" has A in position 2 and 3, which might not be optimal.

Better options:
- ""ABASE"" - but E is excluded.
- ""ABASH"" - S is excluded.
- ""ABIDE"" - E is excluded.
- ""ABIRI"" - not a valid word.
- ""ABORT"" - O is excluded.
- ""ABRUT"" - not a valid word.

Looking at ""A _ R _ _"":
- ""ACRID"" - A C R I D: C, I, D are allowed. This seems good.
- ""AFRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""AGRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""ALARM"" - has A in position 2, which is fine since R isn't there, but A is repeated.
- ""AMBER"" - B, M, E, R: E is excluded.
- ""ANTHR"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ R _"":
- ""ADHAR"" - D, H, A, R: but A is in position 2, which is allowed since R isn't there. However, H is allowed.
- ""ADMIT"" - M, I, T: but R isn't in this word.
- ""AGARW"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ _ R"":
- ""ADMIT"" - doesn't have R.
- ""AGONY"" - O, N, Y: O is excluded.
- ""ALARM"" - has R in position 4, but A is repeated.

Best valid English word seems ""ACRID"" - A C R I D. It starts with A, has R in position 3 (not 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Let me verify:
- A: correct position 1.
- C: new letter.
- R: in word, not in position 2 (it's in 3), so possible.
- I: new letter.
- D: new letter.

This seems optimal for the second guess.

3. The feedback “A(-)” in slot 4 tells us:

3. The feedback “A(-)” in slot 4 tells us:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common. This will give us information about 5 different letters and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because O is a very common vowel and R is a common consonant.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. No O, S, E anywhere.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing R but not in position 2, and avoiding O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding O, S, E).

Let me think of words starting with A, with R not in position 2:
- A R _ _ _ (invalid, R can't be position 2)
- A _ R _ _
- A _ _ R _
- A _ _ _ R

Good candidates:
- A _ R _ _: A B R A N, A C R I D, A F R A I, A G R I D, A H R A N, A I R D R, A L R I D, A M R I D, A N R I D, A P R I D, A T R I D, A V R I D
- A _ _ R _: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R
- A _ _ _ R: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R

Looking at these, ""ABRIR"" comes to mind (though it's Spanish for open, not English). In English, ""ABACK"" has A B A C K, but C is allowed. However, ""ABACK"" has A in position 2 and 3, which might not be optimal.

Better options:
- ""ABASE"" - but E is excluded.
- ""ABASH"" - S is excluded.
- ""ABIDE"" - E is excluded.
- ""ABIRI"" - not a valid word.
- ""ABORT"" - O is excluded.
- ""ABRUT"" - not a valid word.

Looking at ""A _ R _ _"":
- ""ACRID"" - A C R I D: C, I, D are allowed. This seems good.
- ""AFRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""AGRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""ALARM"" - has A in position 2, which is fine since R isn't there, but A is repeated.
- ""AMBER"" - B, M, E, R: E is excluded.
- ""ANTHR"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ R _"":
- ""ADHAR"" - D, H, A, R: but A is in position 2, which is allowed since R isn't there. However, H is allowed.
- ""ADMIT"" - M, I, T: but R isn't in this word.
- ""AGARW"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ _ R"":
- ""ADMIT"" - doesn't have R.
- ""AGONY"" - O, N, Y: O is excluded.
- ""ALARM"" - has R in position 4, but A is repeated.

Best valid English word seems ""ACRID"" - A C R I D. It starts with A, has R in position 3 (not 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Let me verify:
- A: correct position 1.
- C: new letter.
- R: in word, not in position 2 (it's in 3), so possible.
- I: new letter.
- D: new letter.

This seems optimal for the second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ACRID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is locked in position 1.  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - O, S, E are completely absent.

2. ACRID → A(✓) C(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)  
   - A(✓) again confirms position 1.  
   - C, I, D are not in the word at all.  
   - R(✓) now shows R is in position 3.

So the word pattern is:
A _ R _ _

Letters still allowed: all consonants and vowels except O, S, E, C, I, D.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5.  
To maximize information, pick a word that uses two new, frequent letters in those slots.

Good candidates:
- A B R A N → uses B and N (but repeats A, which is already known).
- A F R A N → uses F and N.
- A G R A N → uses G and N.
- A H R A N → uses H and N.
- A M R A N → uses M and N.
- A N R A N → uses N twice (not ideal).
- A P R A N → uses P and N.
- A T R A N → uses T and N.

Among these, ""ABRAN"" is not a recognized English word.  
""AGRAN"" is also not valid.  
""AMRAN"" is not a word.  
""APRAN"" is not a word.  
""ATRAN"" is not a word.

Next, try consonants + vowel combinations.  
Allowed vowels left: U (since A is already used in position 1, and we've excluded O, E, I).

So position 2 could be a consonant, position 5 could be a consonant or U.

Let's try:
- A B R U N → ""ABRUN"" – not a word.
- A F R U N → ""AFRUN"" – not a word.
- A G R U N → ""AGRUN"" – not a word.
- A H R U N → ""AHRUN"" – not a word.
- A M R U N → ""AMRUN"" – not a word.
- A P R U N → ""APRUN"" – not a word.
- A T R U N → ""ATRUN"" – not a word.

Try swapping U with another consonant:
- A B R A N – already considered.
- A B R K N – ""ABRKN"" – not a word.

Let's try ""AUGUR"" – but U is the only allowed vowel, and it repeats U, which is acceptable but might not help much.

Actually, ""AUGUR"" is an archaic word, but it's valid. It uses:
A(✓) U G U R – but position 3 is R, so it would be A U R _ _ – no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is A _ R _ _. So we need:
A [letter 2] R [letter 4] [letter 5]

Let's try:
- A F R A N – ""AFRAN"" – not valid.
- A F R A M – ""AFRAM"" – not valid.
- A F R A Y – ""AFRAY"" – this is a valid word (past tense of ""afire"").

""AFRAY"":
- A(✓) F R A Y
- Uses F and Y, both new letters.
- A is in position 1 (known).
- R is in position 3 (known from feedback).
- A is also in position 4 – this is acceptable since we only know R isn't in position 2, and we're testing F and Y.

This seems like the best next guess to test F and Y in positions 2 and 5.

2. Eliminated letters: O, S, E, C, I, D, F, Y  
   (plus A appears twice, so we can treat the second A as a test of its placement)

3. The feedback “A(-)” in slot 4 tells us:
   - A is in the word but NOT in slot 4.

Therefore the only remaining slot for the second A is slot 5, giving the pattern:
A _ R _ A

We still need a letter for slot 2 and slot 4, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.  
Available consonants: B, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: U (only vowel left)

Let’s pick the two most common remaining consonants, B and N, to test:
A B R U N  →  “ABRUN”  (not a recognized word)  
A B R N A  →  “ABRNA”  (not a word)  
A G R U N  →  “AGRUN”  (not a word)  
A G R N A  →  “AGRNA”  (not a word)  

Real English words that fit A _ R _ A:
- AGRRA – invalid  
- AGUSTA – too long  
- AURORA – contains O (eliminated)  
- ALARA – contains L, valid but repeats A unnecessarily  
- AMARA – contains M, valid  

Among these, “AMARA” uses two new letters (M and A) and fits the pattern perfectly.

So we’ll guess “AMARA”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common. This will give us information about 5 different letters and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because O is a very common vowel and R is a common consonant.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. No O, S, E anywhere.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing R but not in position 2, and avoiding O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding O, S, E).

Let me think of words starting with A, with R not in position 2:
- A R _ _ _ (invalid, R can't be position 2)
- A _ R _ _
- A _ _ R _
- A _ _ _ R

Good candidates:
- A _ R _ _: A B R A N, A C R I D, A F R A I, A G R I D, A H R A N, A I R D R, A L R I D, A M R I D, A N R I D, A P R I D, A T R I D, A V R I D
- A _ _ R _: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R
- A _ _ _ R: A B R A R, A C R A R, A D A R R, A F A R R, A G A R R, A H A R R, A I A R R, A L A R R, A M A R R, A N A R R, A P A R R, A T A R R, A V A R R

Looking at these, ""ABRIR"" comes to mind (though it's Spanish for open, not English). In English, ""ABACK"" has A B A C K, but C is allowed. However, ""ABACK"" has A in position 2 and 3, which might not be optimal.

Better options:
- ""ABASE"" - but E is excluded.
- ""ABASH"" - S is excluded.
- ""ABIDE"" - E is excluded.
- ""ABIRI"" - not a valid word.
- ""ABORT"" - O is excluded.
- ""ABRUT"" - not a valid word.

Looking at ""A _ R _ _"":
- ""ACRID"" - A C R I D: C, I, D are allowed. This seems good.
- ""AFRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""AGRID"" - not a valid word.
- ""ALARM"" - has A in position 2, which is fine since R isn't there, but A is repeated.
- ""AMBER"" - B, M, E, R: E is excluded.
- ""ANTHR"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ R _"":
- ""ADHAR"" - D, H, A, R: but A is in position 2, which is allowed since R isn't there. However, H is allowed.
- ""ADMIT"" - M, I, T: but R isn't in this word.
- ""AGARW"" - not a valid word.

""A _ _ _ R"":
- ""ADMIT"" - doesn't have R.
- ""AGONY"" - O, N, Y: O is excluded.
- ""ALARM"" - has R in position 4, but A is repeated.

Best valid English word seems ""ACRID"" - A C R I D. It starts with A, has R in position 3 (not 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Let me verify:
- A: correct position 1.
- C: new letter.
- R: in word, not in position 2 (it's in 3), so possible.
- I: new letter.
- D: new letter.

This seems optimal for the second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ACRID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is locked in position 1.  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - O, S, E are completely absent.

2. ACRID → A(✓) C(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)  
   - A(✓) again confirms position 1.  
   - C, I, D are not in the word at all.  
   - R(✓) now shows R is in position 3.

So the word pattern is:
A _ R _ _

Letters still allowed: all consonants and vowels except O, S, E, C, I, D.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5.  
To maximize information, pick a word that uses two new, frequent letters in those slots.

Good candidates:
- A B R A N → uses B and N (but repeats A, which is already known).
- A F R A N → uses F and N.
- A G R A N → uses G and N.
- A H R A N → uses H and N.
- A M R A N → uses M and N.
- A N R A N → uses N twice (not ideal).
- A P R A N → uses P and N.
- A T R A N → uses T and N.

Among these, ""ABRAN"" is not a recognized English word.  
""AGRAN"" is also not valid.  
""AMRAN"" is not a word.  
""APRAN"" is not a word.  
""ATRAN"" is not a word.

Next, try consonants + vowel combinations.  
Allowed vowels left: U (since A is already used in position 1, and we've excluded O, E, I).

So position 2 could be a consonant, position 5 could be a consonant or U.

Let's try:
- A B R U N → ""ABRUN"" – not a word.
- A F R U N → ""AFRUN"" – not a word.
- A G R U N → ""AGRUN"" – not a word.
- A H R U N → ""AHRUN"" – not a word.
- A M R U N → ""AMRUN"" – not a word.
- A P R U N → ""APRUN"" – not a word.
- A T R U N → ""ATRUN"" – not a word.

Try swapping U with another consonant:
- A B R A N – already considered.
- A B R K N – ""ABRKN"" – not a word.

Let's try ""AUGUR"" – but U is the only allowed vowel, and it repeats U, which is acceptable but might not help much.

Actually, ""AUGUR"" is an archaic word, but it's valid. It uses:
A(✓) U G U R – but position 3 is R, so it would be A U R _ _ – no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is A _ R _ _. So we need:
A [letter 2] R [letter 4] [letter 5]

Let's try:
- A F R A N – ""AFRAN"" – not valid.
- A F R A M – ""AFRAM"" – not valid.
- A F R A Y – ""AFRAY"" – this is a valid word (past tense of ""afire"").

""AFRAY"":
- A(✓) F R A Y
- Uses F and Y, both new letters.
- A is in position 1 (known).
- R is in position 3 (known from feedback).
- A is also in position 4 – this is acceptable since we only know R isn't in position 2, and we're testing F and Y.

This seems like the best next guess to test F and Y in positions 2 and 5.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Pattern: A _ R _ _  (A fixed in slot 1, R fixed in slot 3)
2. Eliminated letters: O, S, E, C, I, D, F, Y  
   (plus A appears twice, so we can treat the second A as a test of its placement)

3. The feedback “A(-)” in slot 4 tells us:
   - A is in the word but NOT in slot 4.

Therefore the only remaining slot for the second A is slot 5, giving the pattern:
A _ R _ A

We still need a letter for slot 2 and slot 4, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.  
Available consonants: B, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: U (only vowel left)

Let’s pick the two most common remaining consonants, B and N, to test:
A B R U N  →  “ABRUN”  (not a recognized word)  
A B R N A  →  “ABRNA”  (not a word)  
A G R U N  →  “AGRUN”  (not a word)  
A G R N A  →  “AGRNA”  (not a word)  

Real English words that fit A _ R _ A:
- AGRRA – invalid  
- AGUSTA – too long  
- AURORA – contains O (eliminated)  
- ALARA – contains L, valid but repeats A unnecessarily  
- AMARA – contains M, valid  

Among these, “AMARA” uses two new letters (M and A) and fits the pattern perfectly.

So we’ll guess “AMARA”.

We now have five rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is correct in position 1, R is in the word but not in position 2.

2. ACRID → A(✓) C(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ A is correct in position 1, R is correct in position 3.

3. AFRAY → A(✓) F(x) R(✓) A(-) Y(x)  
   ⇒ A is correct in position 1, R is correct in position 3, and A is in the word but not in position 4.

4. AMARA → A(✓) M(-) A(-) R(-) A(-)  
   ⇒ A is correct in position 1, M is in the word but not in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known), R is in the word but not in position 4 (already known), and A is in the word but not in position 5.

5. AURAL → A(✓) U(✓) R(✓) A(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ A is correct in position 1, U is correct in position 2, R is correct in position 3, and A is in the word but not in position 4.

From all of this we can deduce the exact pattern:

- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 2: U (fixed)
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 4: A is in the word but not in position 4 ⇒ A cannot be in position 4, so position 4 must be some other letter.
- Position 5: A is in the word but not in position 5 ⇒ A must be in position 4.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me re-examine:

From AURAL feedback:
- A(✓) U(✓) R(✓) A(-) L(x)
  - A is correct in position 1
  - U is correct in position 2
  - R is correct in position 3
  - A is in the word but not in position 4 ⇒ A cannot be in position 4
  - L is not in the word

But we also know from earlier:
- A must be in the word somewhere. It is already in position 1, so it cannot appear again. This means the feedback ""A(-)"" in positions 4 and 5 actually tells us A is not in those positions, which is consistent because A is already in position 1.

Therefore the pattern is:
A U R _ _

We need a letter for position 4 and 5. From eliminated letters: O, S, E, C, I, D, F, Y, M, L.

Remaining available letters: B, G, H, K, N, P, T, V, W, X, Z, and A is already used.

Looking for common English words that fit A U R _ _:
- AUROR (not a word)
- AURAT (not common)
- AURIC (not common)
- AURUM (valid word, Latin for gold)

""AURUM"" uses:
- U in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (correct)
- U in position 4 (but U is already in position 2, and we haven't ruled out repeats)
- M in position 5 (but M was marked as in the word but not in position 2, and we haven't ruled out position 5 for M)

Wait, let's check if ""AURUM"" fits all constraints:
- A(✓) U(✓) R(✓) U(?) M(?)
  - From feedback: M was in AMARA and marked (-), meaning M is in the word but not in position 2. Position 5 is allowed.
  - U was in AURAL and marked (✓) in position 2, so U can appear again in position 4.

Thus ""AURUM"" is a valid guess.
