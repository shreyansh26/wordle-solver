For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good mix of vowels and common consonants
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - another strong option
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters (A, E, O) and has R and S which are very common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4

Next I want to:
1. Keep O and S but place them in new positions
2. Introduce new common consonants that weren't used yet (T, N, L, C, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

I'll try a word that places O and S in new spots and adds new letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- O in position 2 (new position)
- U, N, D are new letters
- Avoids A, R, E

But let me double-check: SOUND has S, O, U, N, D - all new letters except O and S which we know are in the word. This seems good.

However, another option could be ""SOUTH"" but H might be less common. ""SOUND"" seems better.

Wait, let me think of a word that keeps O and S but also uses other common letters. ""SOLID"" would place O in position 2 and S in position 1, but uses I and D which are okay. But ""SOUND"" is better as it uses U and N.

Actually, ""SOUND"" is a solid choice here.

A good next guess should:
1. Include both O and S in new positions.
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible.
3. Avoid any of the six letters already ruled out.

A word that satisfies these criteria is “STOIC”:

So the secret word:
- Must contain O, S, I each exactly once.

Remaining high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out:

Candidate word: “SOLID” – but D is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “SILKY” – K and Y are new and allowed.  
Check letters: S, I, L, K, Y – all allowed and contain the required O, S, I?

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good mix of vowels and common consonants
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - another strong option
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters (A, E, O) and has R and S which are very common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4

Next I want to:
1. Keep O and S but place them in new positions
2. Introduce new common consonants that weren't used yet (T, N, L, C, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

I'll try a word that places O and S in new spots and adds new letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- O in position 2 (new position)
- U, N, D are new letters
- Avoids A, R, E

But let me double-check: SOUND has S, O, U, N, D - all new letters except O and S which we know are in the word. This seems good.

However, another option could be ""SOUTH"" but H might be less common. ""SOUND"" seems better.

Wait, let me think of a word that keeps O and S but also uses other common letters. ""SOLID"" would place O in position 2 and S in position 1, but uses I and D which are okay. But ""SOUND"" is better as it uses U and N.

Actually, ""SOUND"" is a solid choice here.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: O, S  

So the secret word:
- Contains both O and S exactly once each
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, U, N, D
- The positions of O and S are still to be determined

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining high-frequency letters that haven’t been tried yet include T, I, L, C, Y, etc.  
A good next guess should:
1. Include both O and S in new positions.
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible.
3. Avoid any of the six letters already ruled out.

A word that satisfies these criteria is “STOIC”:
- S is in position 1 (new spot)
- T, I, C are new letters
- O is in position 3 (another new spot)

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good mix of vowels and common consonants
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - another strong option
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters (A, E, O) and has R and S which are very common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4

Next I want to:
1. Keep O and S but place them in new positions
2. Introduce new common consonants that weren't used yet (T, N, L, C, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

I'll try a word that places O and S in new spots and adds new letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- O in position 2 (new position)
- U, N, D are new letters
- Avoids A, R, E

But let me double-check: SOUND has S, O, U, N, D - all new letters except O and S which we know are in the word. This seems good.

However, another option could be ""SOUTH"" but H might be less common. ""SOUND"" seems better.

Wait, let me think of a word that keeps O and S but also uses other common letters. ""SOLID"" would place O in position 2 and S in position 1, but uses I and D which are okay. But ""SOUND"" is better as it uses U and N.

Actually, ""SOUND"" is a solid choice here.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: O, S  

So the secret word:
- Contains both O and S exactly once each
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, U, N, D
- The positions of O and S are still to be determined

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining high-frequency letters that haven’t been tried yet include T, I, L, C, Y, etc.  
A good next guess should:
1. Include both O and S in new positions.
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible.
3. Avoid any of the six letters already ruled out.

A word that satisfies these criteria is “STOIC”:
- S is in position 1 (new spot)
- T, I, C are new letters
- O is in position 3 (another new spot)

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

Current constraints after three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
O, S, I   (all three appeared in previous guesses with “-” feedback)

So the secret word:
- Must contain O, S, I each exactly once.
- Must NOT contain any of A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C.
- Positions of O, S, I are still to be determined.

Remaining high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out:  
B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the known O, S, I.

We need a 5-letter word using O, S, I plus two new letters from the allowed set.  
A good strategy is to pick two new consonants that are common and haven’t been tried.  
Let’s choose L and M (both still allowed).

Candidate word: “SOLID” – but D is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “SILKY” – K and Y are new and allowed.  
Check letters: S, I, L, K, Y – all allowed and contain the required O, S, I?  
Wait, “SILKY” has S, I, L, K, Y – but we need O somewhere. So this is invalid.

We must include O. So let’s try “SOLID” again but D is out.  
Try “SPOOL” – but P is allowed, and we have O twice, but we don’t know if O appears twice. The feedback only confirmed one O exists, but didn’t specify count. However, safest assumption is one O.

Try “SOLLY” – but Y is allowed, but again double L might not be needed.  

Better approach: form a word with O, S, I plus two new letters.  
Example: “SPOIL” – letters S, P, O, I, L. All allowed. Contains O, S, I.  
Check positions: P and L are new, so this is informative.

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the four rounds we now have:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C, P, L

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown):
O, S, I   (each appeared with “-” in every guess so far)

So the secret word must contain O, S, I exactly once each, and two additional letters that are NOT any of the 10 ruled-out letters above.

Remaining high-frequency letters still allowed:
B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that uses O, S, I plus two distinct letters from {B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y}.

Let’s pick two new consonants that are common and haven’t been tried.  
Good candidates: B, F, G, H, K, M.

A word that satisfies this is “SHOIK” – but that isn’t valid English.  
“SHOGI” – invalid.  
“SHOCK” – contains C (ruled out).  
“SHOWN” – contains W and N, but N is ruled out.  
“SHOPI” – contains P (ruled out).  
“SHOYI” – not a word.  

Let’s try “FOGSY” – contains F, G, S, Y, but no I or O.  
“MOGSI” – not a word.  

A valid English word using O, S, I plus two allowed letters is “SHOIK” (not valid), so we need to rearrange.

Consider “SHOIK” again – not valid.  
Another valid word: “SHOGI” – no.  
“SHOCK” – C out.  
“SHOWN” – N out.  

Let’s try “HOSKY” – H, O, S, K, Y. Contains O, S, and two new letters H, K, Y.  
Check: H, K, Y are allowed (not in the x-list).  
Word is valid English.  
Contains O, S, and two new letters.  

This seems like the best next guess.

A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C, P, L, H, K, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (each has appeared with “-” feedback):
O, S, I   (each must appear exactly once)

So the secret word is a 5-letter anagram of:
O, S, I plus two other letters that are NOT in the forbidden list above.

The only letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) are:
B, F, G, M, V, W   (and a few others, but these are the common ones)

We need a valid English word using O, S, I plus two letters from {B, F, G, M, V, W}.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words containing O, S, I and two of those letters:

- B:   BOGSI – invalid  
- F:   FOIMS – invalid  
- G:   GOISM – invalid  
- M:   MOGS – too short  
- V:   VOISM – invalid  
- W:   WISOM – invalid  

Rearranging the only viable combination we see:
We need two consonants from {B, F, G, M, V, W} plus O, S, I.

The only valid English word that fits is:
“MOBIS” – but that’s a proper noun (a type of motorcycle).
