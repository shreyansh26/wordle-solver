For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word and narrowing down possibilities.

Let me think through why this is a good choice:
- It has 5 distinct letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits.
- It covers common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words.
- It includes common consonants (R, S) which are also frequently found in English words.

This should provide useful information for my next guess regardless of the feedback I receive.

   – E is still fixed in position 5.

So far we know:

- Letters definitely in the word: I (pos 2), M (somewhere not pos 1), G (somewhere not pos 4).  
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, D.  

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, Z.  
We need two more consonants for positions 1, 3, 4 (but M and G must fit somewhere).

Possible placements:
- M and G must occupy positions 3 and 4 (since they can’t be in their previous spots and position 1 is open).  
- Position 1 must be a new consonant.

Position 2: I (confirmed)  
Position 3: M (must be here or 4)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word and narrowing down possibilities.

Let me think through why this is a good choice:
- It has 5 distinct letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits.
- It covers common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words.
- It includes common consonants (R, S) which are also frequently found in English words.

This should provide useful information for my next guess regardless of the feedback I receive.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

A word like “UNTIE” would use U, N, T, I, E, but it has 5 letters and ends in E, and avoids A, R, O, S.  
However, “UNTIE” has U and I which are good vowels to test, and N, T are common consonants.

Another candidate is “ELITE” but it repeats E and has L, I, T which are all good.  
But “UNTIE” tests more new letters (U, N, T, I) compared to “ELITE” (L, I, T).

I’ll go with “UNTIE”.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is in the correct last position.  
   – A, R, O, S are completely absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   – E is still correct in the last position.  
   – U, N, T are completely absent.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.  
- Letter I is somewhere in the first three positions.

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.  
Remaining vowels: I (already confirmed), plus possibly Y.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.  
- Place I in a new position (1st or 2nd or 3rd, but not 4th).  
- Introduce new common consonants.

Candidate: “CHILD” – but D is at the end and we already know E is there, so invalid.  
Candidate: “WIDEN” – but N is already excluded.  
Candidate: “FIVER” – but R is excluded.  
Candidate: “BLIMP” – no E at the end.  
Candidate: “MIDGE” – fits: M, I, D, G, E.  
   – I is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4th).  
   – M, D, G are new consonants to test.  
   – E is fixed in position 5.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word and narrowing down possibilities.\n\nLet me think through why this is a good choice:\n- It has 5 distinct letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits.\n- It covers common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words.\n- It includes common consonants (R, S) which are also frequently found in English words.\n\nThis should provide useful information for my next guess regardless of the feedback I receive.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position.\n- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  \nI now need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nGood remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  \nGood remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).\n\nA word like “UNTIE” would use U, N, T, I, E, but it has 5 letters and ends in E, and avoids A, R, O, S.  \nHowever, “UNTIE” has U and I which are good vowels to test, and N, T are common consonants.\n\nAnother candidate is “ELITE” but it repeats E and has L, I, T which are all good.  \nBut “UNTIE” tests more new letters (U, N, T, I) compared to “ELITE” (L, I, T).\n\nI’ll go with “UNTIE”.\n\n<guess>UNTIE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we have:\n\n1.

From all four guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – U, N, T are absent.

3. MIDGE → M(-) I(✓) D(x) G(-) E(✓)  
   – I is confirmed in position 2.  
   – M is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – D is absent.  
   – G is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – E is still fixed in position 5.

4. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(-) M(✓) E(✓)  
   – I is again marked “-” (in word, wrong spot) but we just learned it is in position 2.  
   – M is confirmed in position 4.  
   – C and H are absent.  
   – E is still fixed in position 5.

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: ? (unknown, must be new consonant)  
- Position 2: I (confirmed)  
- Position 3: ? (unknown)  
- Position 4: M (confirmed)  
- Position 5: E (confirmed)

Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, D, C, H.

Remaining consonants to test: B, F, G, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, Z.

We also know G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already satisfied) and NOT in position 1 (from MIDGE feedback), so G must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ I G M E.

Wait, let me think differently.  
We have _ I _ M E with I in position 2 and M in position 4.  
G must be in position 3 (since it’s in the word but not in 4 and not in 1).  
Thus the word is _ I G M E.
