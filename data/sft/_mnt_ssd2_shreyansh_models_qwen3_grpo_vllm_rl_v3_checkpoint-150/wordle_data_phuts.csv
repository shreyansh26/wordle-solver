### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not 4th).
2. Avoids the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good candidates: STING, SLING, SWING, SHINE, SWISH, etc.

- Uses T, I, N, G - all common and not yet tested.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but currently in the wrong positions:
   - S (from both guesses, it was in position 4 then 1 → must be in 2, 3 or 5)
   - T (from STING, it was in position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4 or 5)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and T.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from guesses 1 & 2).
- T cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2).

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out).

A good next word should:
- Place S in a new spot (positions 2, 3 or 5).
- Place T in a new spot (positions 1, 3, 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters, especially U (the only remaining vowel) and some high-frequency consonants.

Let’s try:
- S in position 2
- T in position 3
- Use U in position 5
- Fill remaining spots with new consonants.

A word like “BUSTY” fits:
- B (new consonant)
- U (only remaining vowel)
- S (in new position 2)
- T (in new position 3)
- Y (new consonant)

But let’s double-check:
- Contains S and T (required)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 2)
- T not in 2 (it’s in 3)
- All letters are fresh or confirmed safe.

Thus, “BUSTY” is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - T is in the word and is in the correct position (position 4, from BUSTY).
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (from AROSE, STING, BUSTY it was in positions 4, 2, 3 respectively; so S cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 → must be in 1 or 5).
   - U is in the word but in the wrong position (from BUSTY it was in position 2 → cannot be in 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 4 is T, so 1, 3, or 5).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T _ (with T fixed in position 4), and it must contain both S and U somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Constraints:
- S must be in 1 or 5.
- U must be in 1, 3, or 5.
- No letters from the forbidden list (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y).

Remaining possible letters (common ones): C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, S, T (but T is already placed), etc.

Let’s consider possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 1
Then word structure: S _ _ T _
U must be in 3 or 5 (since 2 is taken by S, but wait - S is in 1, so positions 2,3,5 are open for U. But U cannot be in 2 (from BUSTY feedback), so U must be in 3 or 5.

So possible structures:
- S U _ T _
- S _ U T _

Case 2: S in position 5
Then word structure: _ _ _ T S
U must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be in 2 or 4, and 5 is S).

Possible structures:
- U _ _ T S
- _ U _ T S

Let’s think of common words fitting these patterns.

Looking at Case 1: S _ _ T _
Possible words: S U _ T _ → ""SUCKT"" is not valid. ""SULFT"" no. Maybe ""SULKY"" but Y is forbidden. ""SULFS"" no. Not obvious.

Looking at Case 2: _ U _ T S
Possible words: ""CULTS"" - but L is allowed, C is allowed, U is allowed, T is fixed, S is in 5. This fits all constraints:
- C, U, L, T, S
- No forbidden letters
- T is in 4
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- U is in 2 (but wait, from BUSTY feedback, U was in position 2 and got (-), meaning U is in word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in 2. Thus ""CULTS"" is invalid because U would be in 2.)

Next option: _ _ U T S
Possible words: ""PLUTS"" - but P, L, U, T, S. P is allowed, L is allowed, U is allowed, T is fixed, S is in 5. This fits:
- P, L, U, T, S
- No forbidden letters
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- T is in 4 (correct)

Another option: ""FLUTS"" - but F, L, U, T, S. Also valid.

Between ""PLUTS"" and ""FLUTS"", ""FLUTS"" is more common (though both are valid).

But let me check if there are better options.

Looking back at Case 1 with corrected understanding:
S must be in 1 or 5.
U must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, and 4 is T).

If S is in 1:
S _ _ T _
U must be in 3 or 5.
So possible:
- S U _ T _ → but U cannot be in 2 (already), so this would be S U _ T _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). But U would be in 2, which is invalid. So this structure is impossible.
- S _ U T _ → this is possible. So structure: S _ U T _
Possible letters for position 2: from remaining, common ones like C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, etc.
Possible words: ""SCOUT"" - but O is forbidden. ""SPUTS"" - P, U, T, S - but S is in 5, U is in 3. This fits:
- S P U T S - but S is repeated, which is allowed, but ""SPUTS"" is not a common word.
""SQUATS"" - too long. ""SLUTS"" - L, U, T, S. This is valid:
- S L U T S - but S is repeated, and ""SLUTS"" is valid.
But let's see if we can find a better word.

Looking at Case 2: _ _ _ T S
U must be in 1 or 3.
- U _ _ T S → ""ULCTS"" - no.
- _ U _ T S → ""CULTS"" was invalid because U would be in 2. But here it's _ U _ T S, so:
Possible: ""CULTS"" - but U is in 2, which is invalid.
Wait, structure is _ U _ T S:
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
We need:
- Position 2: U (but from BUSTY, U was in position 2 and got (-), so U cannot be in 2. Thus this structure is invalid.)

Thus Case 2 is impossible because U cannot be in 2 and must be in 1 or 3, but:
- If U is in 1: U _ _ T S
- If U is in 3: _ _ U T S

Looking at U _ _ T S: positions 1,2,3,4,5:
U is in 1 (allowed), then positions 2 and 3 need letters not in forbidden list.
Possible: ""UPOTS"" - no. ""UDOTS"" - no. ""ULCTS"" - no.

Looking at _ _ U T S:
Positions 1 and 2: need letters not forbidden.
Possible: ""CULTS"" - but U is in 3, which is allowed. C, U, L, T, S.
But ""CULTS"" is a valid word and fits:
- C, U, L, T, S
- T is in 4
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

Thus ""CULTS"" is a valid guess.

But wait, from BUSTY feedback, U was in position 2 and got (-), meaning U is in word but not in position 2. So U can be in 1,3,4,5. But 4 is T, so 1 or 3 or 5. In ""CULTS"", U is in 3 - allowed.

Thus ""CULTS"" is a valid next guess.

But let me think if there's a more obvious word. ""PLUTS"" is also valid, but ""CULTS"" is more common.

Another option: ""FLUTS"" - F, L, U, T, S. This fits:
- F, L, U, T, S
- T in 4
- U in 3
- S in 5
- No forbidden letters

Between ""CULTS"" and ""FLUTS"", ""FLUTS"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""FLUTS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not 4th).
2. Avoids the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good candidates: STING, SLING, SWING, SHINE, SWISH, etc.

""STING"" seems strong because:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- Uses T, I, N, G - all common and not yet tested.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but currently in the wrong positions:
   - S (from both guesses, it was in position 4 then 1 → must be in 2, 3 or 5)
   - T (from STING, it was in position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4 or 5)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and T.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from guesses 1 & 2).
- T cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2).

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out).

A good next word should:
- Place S in a new spot (positions 2, 3 or 5).
- Place T in a new spot (positions 1, 3, 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters, especially U (the only remaining vowel) and some high-frequency consonants.

Let’s try:
- S in position 2
- T in position 3
- Use U in position 5
- Fill remaining spots with new consonants.

A word like “BUSTY” fits:
- B (new consonant)
- U (only remaining vowel)
- S (in new position 2)
- T (in new position 3)
- Y (new consonant)

But let’s double-check:
- Contains S and T (required)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 2)
- T not in 2 (it’s in 3)
- All letters are fresh or confirmed safe.

Thus, “BUSTY” is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: BUSTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - T is in the word and is in the correct position (position 4, from BUSTY).
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (from AROSE, STING, BUSTY it was in positions 4, 2, 3 respectively; so S cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 → must be in 1 or 5).
   - U is in the word but in the wrong position (from BUSTY it was in position 2 → cannot be in 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 4 is T, so 1, 3, or 5).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T _ (with T fixed in position 4), and it must contain both S and U somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Constraints:
- S must be in 1 or 5.
- U must be in 1, 3, or 5.
- No letters from the forbidden list (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y).

Remaining possible letters (common ones): C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, S, T (but T is already placed), etc.

Let’s consider possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 1
Then word structure: S _ _ T _
U must be in 3 or 5 (since 2 is taken by S, but wait - S is in 1, so positions 2,3,5 are open for U. But U cannot be in 2 (from BUSTY feedback), so U must be in 3 or 5.

So possible structures:
- S U _ T _
- S _ U T _

Case 2: S in position 5
Then word structure: _ _ _ T S
U must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be in 2 or 4, and 5 is S).

Possible structures:
- U _ _ T S
- _ U _ T S

Let’s think of common words fitting these patterns.

Looking at Case 1: S _ _ T _
Possible words: S U _ T _ → ""SUCKT"" is not valid. ""SULFT"" no. Maybe ""SULKY"" but Y is forbidden. ""SULFS"" no. Not obvious.

Looking at Case 2: _ U _ T S
Possible words: ""CULTS"" - but L is allowed, C is allowed, U is allowed, T is fixed, S is in 5. This fits all constraints:
- C, U, L, T, S
- No forbidden letters
- T is in 4
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- U is in 2 (but wait, from BUSTY feedback, U was in position 2 and got (-), meaning U is in word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in 2. Thus ""CULTS"" is invalid because U would be in 2.)

Next option: _ _ U T S
Possible words: ""PLUTS"" - but P, L, U, T, S. P is allowed, L is allowed, U is allowed, T is fixed, S is in 5. This fits:
- P, L, U, T, S
- No forbidden letters
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- T is in 4 (correct)

Another option: ""FLUTS"" - but F, L, U, T, S. Also valid.

Between ""PLUTS"" and ""FLUTS"", ""FLUTS"" is more common (though both are valid).

But let me check if there are better options.

Looking back at Case 1 with corrected understanding:
S must be in 1 or 5.
U must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, and 4 is T).

If S is in 1:
S _ _ T _
U must be in 3 or 5.
So possible:
- S U _ T _ → but U cannot be in 2 (already), so this would be S U _ T _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). But U would be in 2, which is invalid. So this structure is impossible.
- S _ U T _ → this is possible. So structure: S _ U T _
Possible letters for position 2: from remaining, common ones like C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, etc.
Possible words: ""SCOUT"" - but O is forbidden. ""SPUTS"" - P, U, T, S - but S is in 5, U is in 3. This fits:
- S P U T S - but S is repeated, which is allowed, but ""SPUTS"" is not a common word.
""SQUATS"" - too long. ""SLUTS"" - L, U, T, S. This is valid:
- S L U T S - but S is repeated, and ""SLUTS"" is valid.
But let's see if we can find a better word.

Looking at Case 2: _ _ _ T S
U must be in 1 or 3.
- U _ _ T S → ""ULCTS"" - no.
- _ U _ T S → ""CULTS"" was invalid because U would be in 2. But here it's _ U _ T S, so:
Possible: ""CULTS"" - but U is in 2, which is invalid.
Wait, structure is _ U _ T S:
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
We need:
- Position 2: U (but from BUSTY, U was in position 2 and got (-), so U cannot be in 2. Thus this structure is invalid.)

Thus Case 2 is impossible because U cannot be in 2 and must be in 1 or 3, but:
- If U is in 1: U _ _ T S
- If U is in 3: _ _ U T S

Looking at U _ _ T S: positions 1,2,3,4,5:
U is in 1 (allowed), then positions 2 and 3 need letters not in forbidden list.
Possible: ""UPOTS"" - no. ""UDOTS"" - no. ""ULCTS"" - no.

Looking at _ _ U T S:
Positions 1 and 2: need letters not forbidden.
Possible: ""CULTS"" - but U is in 3, which is allowed. C, U, L, T, S.
But ""CULTS"" is a valid word and fits:
- C, U, L, T, S
- T is in 4
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

Thus ""CULTS"" is a valid guess.

But wait, from BUSTY feedback, U was in position 2 and got (-), meaning U is in word but not in position 2. So U can be in 1,3,4,5. But 4 is T, so 1 or 3 or 5. In ""CULTS"", U is in 3 - allowed.

Thus ""CULTS"" is a valid next guess.

But let me think if there's a more obvious word. ""PLUTS"" is also valid, but ""CULTS"" is more common.

Another option: ""FLUTS"" - F, L, U, T, S. This fits:
- F, L, U, T, S
- T in 4
- U in 3
- S in 5
- No forbidden letters

Between ""CULTS"" and ""FLUTS"", ""FLUTS"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""FLUTS"".

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y, F, L

2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - U is in position 3 (from FLUTS feedback: U(✓))
   - T is in position 4 (from BUSTY feedback: T(✓))
   - S is in position 5 (from FLUTS feedback: S(✓))

So the word has the fixed pattern:
_ _ U T S

3. Remaining letters to consider for positions 1 and 2:
   From the alphabet, excluding all forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y, F, L), the remaining consonants are:
   C, D, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and vowels, but all vowels except U are already excluded; U is used).

Since we need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, and we have limited options, we should look for common combinations.

Possible high-frequency remaining consonants: C, D, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""UTS"":
- ""CUTS"" – too short.
- ""HUTS"" – too short.
- ""MUTTS"" – but T is already in position 4, and this would have T in position 5, which conflicts.
- ""PUDTS"" – not a word.
- ""WUDTS"" – not a word.
- ""DUSTS"" – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 4, which conflicts with T being in position 4.
- ""CUSTS"" – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 5, but C, U, S, T, S – double S is possible, but ""CUSTS"" is not a common word.
- ""HUSTS"" – not a word.
- ""MUSTS"" – this is a valid word: M, U, S, T, S. It fits the pattern _ _ U T S with M and S. But S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 5 again. The word ""MUSTS"" is valid.

Another possibility: ""HUTTS"" – but not a word.
""WUTTS"" – not a word.

Looking at ""MUSTS"":
- M: not yet tested.
- U: confirmed in position 3.
- S: confirmed in position 5.
- T: confirmed in position 4.
- Second S: allowed as repetition is not forbidden.

Is there a better word? ""DUSTS"" is similar but D is allowed, but ""DUSTS"" is not a common word.
""CUSTS"" is not a common word either.

The most common word fitting _ _ U T S with remaining letters seems to be ""MUSTS"".

Thus, the next logical guess is ""MUSTS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not 4th).
2. Avoids the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good candidates: STING, SLING, SWING, SHINE, SWISH, etc.

""STING"" seems strong because:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- Uses T, I, N, G - all common and not yet tested.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but currently in the wrong positions:
   - S (from both guesses, it was in position 4 then 1 → must be in 2, 3 or 5)
   - T (from STING, it was in position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4 or 5)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and T.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N, G.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from guesses 1 & 2).
- T cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2).

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out).

A good next word should:
- Place S in a new spot (positions 2, 3 or 5).
- Place T in a new spot (positions 1, 3, 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters, especially U (the only remaining vowel) and some high-frequency consonants.

Let’s try:
- S in position 2
- T in position 3
- Use U in position 5
- Fill remaining spots with new consonants.

A word like “BUSTY” fits:
- B (new consonant)
- U (only remaining vowel)
- S (in new position 2)
- T (in new position 3)
- Y (new consonant)

But let’s double-check:
- Contains S and T (required)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 2)
- T not in 2 (it’s in 3)
- All letters are fresh or confirmed safe.

Thus, “BUSTY” is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: BUSTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - T is in the word and is in the correct position (position 4, from BUSTY).
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (from AROSE, STING, BUSTY it was in positions 4, 2, 3 respectively; so S cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 → must be in 1 or 5).
   - U is in the word but in the wrong position (from BUSTY it was in position 2 → cannot be in 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 4 is T, so 1, 3, or 5).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T _ (with T fixed in position 4), and it must contain both S and U somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Constraints:
- S must be in 1 or 5.
- U must be in 1, 3, or 5.
- No letters from the forbidden list (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y).

Remaining possible letters (common ones): C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, S, T (but T is already placed), etc.

Let’s consider possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 1
Then word structure: S _ _ T _
U must be in 3 or 5 (since 2 is taken by S, but wait - S is in 1, so positions 2,3,5 are open for U. But U cannot be in 2 (from BUSTY feedback), so U must be in 3 or 5.

So possible structures:
- S U _ T _
- S _ U T _

Case 2: S in position 5
Then word structure: _ _ _ T S
U must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be in 2 or 4, and 5 is S).

Possible structures:
- U _ _ T S
- _ U _ T S

Let’s think of common words fitting these patterns.

Looking at Case 1: S _ _ T _
Possible words: S U _ T _ → ""SUCKT"" is not valid. ""SULFT"" no. Maybe ""SULKY"" but Y is forbidden. ""SULFS"" no. Not obvious.

Looking at Case 2: _ U _ T S
Possible words: ""CULTS"" - but L is allowed, C is allowed, U is allowed, T is fixed, S is in 5. This fits all constraints:
- C, U, L, T, S
- No forbidden letters
- T is in 4
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- U is in 2 (but wait, from BUSTY feedback, U was in position 2 and got (-), meaning U is in word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in 2. Thus ""CULTS"" is invalid because U would be in 2.)

Next option: _ _ U T S
Possible words: ""PLUTS"" - but P, L, U, T, S. P is allowed, L is allowed, U is allowed, T is fixed, S is in 5. This fits:
- P, L, U, T, S
- No forbidden letters
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- T is in 4 (correct)

Another option: ""FLUTS"" - but F, L, U, T, S. Also valid.

Between ""PLUTS"" and ""FLUTS"", ""FLUTS"" is more common (though both are valid).

But let me check if there are better options.

Looking back at Case 1 with corrected understanding:
S must be in 1 or 5.
U must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, and 4 is T).

If S is in 1:
S _ _ T _
U must be in 3 or 5.
So possible:
- S U _ T _ → but U cannot be in 2 (already), so this would be S U _ T _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). But U would be in 2, which is invalid. So this structure is impossible.
- S _ U T _ → this is possible. So structure: S _ U T _
Possible letters for position 2: from remaining, common ones like C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, etc.
Possible words: ""SCOUT"" - but O is forbidden. ""SPUTS"" - P, U, T, S - but S is in 5, U is in 3. This fits:
- S P U T S - but S is repeated, which is allowed, but ""SPUTS"" is not a common word.
""SQUATS"" - too long. ""SLUTS"" - L, U, T, S. This is valid:
- S L U T S - but S is repeated, and ""SLUTS"" is valid.
But let's see if we can find a better word.

Looking at Case 2: _ _ _ T S
U must be in 1 or 3.
- U _ _ T S → ""ULCTS"" - no.
- _ U _ T S → ""CULTS"" was invalid because U would be in 2. But here it's _ U _ T S, so:
Possible: ""CULTS"" - but U is in 2, which is invalid.
Wait, structure is _ U _ T S:
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
We need:
- Position 2: U (but from BUSTY, U was in position 2 and got (-), so U cannot be in 2. Thus this structure is invalid.)

Thus Case 2 is impossible because U cannot be in 2 and must be in 1 or 3, but:
- If U is in 1: U _ _ T S
- If U is in 3: _ _ U T S

Looking at U _ _ T S: positions 1,2,3,4,5:
U is in 1 (allowed), then positions 2 and 3 need letters not in forbidden list.
Possible: ""UPOTS"" - no. ""UDOTS"" - no. ""ULCTS"" - no.

Looking at _ _ U T S:
Positions 1 and 2: need letters not forbidden.
Possible: ""CULTS"" - but U is in 3, which is allowed. C, U, L, T, S.
But ""CULTS"" is a valid word and fits:
- C, U, L, T, S
- T is in 4
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

Thus ""CULTS"" is a valid guess.

But wait, from BUSTY feedback, U was in position 2 and got (-), meaning U is in word but not in position 2. So U can be in 1,3,4,5. But 4 is T, so 1 or 3 or 5. In ""CULTS"", U is in 3 - allowed.

Thus ""CULTS"" is a valid next guess.

But let me think if there's a more obvious word. ""PLUTS"" is also valid, but ""CULTS"" is more common.

Another option: ""FLUTS"" - F, L, U, T, S. This fits:
- F, L, U, T, S
- T in 4
- U in 3
- S in 5
- No forbidden letters

Between ""CULTS"" and ""FLUTS"", ""FLUTS"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""FLUTS"".

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y, F, L

2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - U is in position 3 (from FLUTS feedback: U(✓))
   - T is in position 4 (from BUSTY feedback: T(✓))
   - S is in position 5 (from FLUTS feedback: S(✓))

So the word has the fixed pattern:
_ _ U T S

3. Remaining letters to consider for positions 1 and 2:
   From the alphabet, excluding all forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y, F, L), the remaining consonants are:
   C, D, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and vowels, but all vowels except U are already excluded; U is used).

Since we need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, and we have limited options, we should look for common combinations.

Possible high-frequency remaining consonants: C, D, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""UTS"":
- ""CUTS"" – too short.
- ""HUTS"" – too short.
- ""MUTTS"" – but T is already in position 4, and this would have T in position 5, which conflicts.
- ""PUDTS"" – not a word.
- ""WUDTS"" – not a word.
- ""DUSTS"" – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 4, which conflicts with T being in position 4.
- ""CUSTS"" – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 5, but C, U, S, T, S – double S is possible, but ""CUSTS"" is not a common word.
- ""HUSTS"" – not a word.
- ""MUSTS"" – this is a valid word: M, U, S, T, S. It fits the pattern _ _ U T S with M and S. But S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 5 again. The word ""MUSTS"" is valid.

Another possibility: ""HUTTS"" – but not a word.
""WUTTS"" – not a word.

Looking at ""MUSTS"":
- M: not yet tested.
- U: confirmed in position 3.
- S: confirmed in position 5.
- T: confirmed in position 4.
- Second S: allowed as repetition is not forbidden.

Is there a better word? ""DUSTS"" is similar but D is allowed, but ""DUSTS"" is not a common word.
""CUSTS"" is not a common word either.

The most common word fitting _ _ U T S with remaining letters seems to be ""MUSTS"".

Thus, the next logical guess is ""MUSTS"".

Letters that ARE in the word

- S is in position 5 (✓ from FLUTS and confirmed in MUSTS)  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in MUSTS it appeared in position 2 and still got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not there)

So the word pattern is  
_ _ _ T S  
and it must contain U somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
But position 5 is already S, so U must be in position 1 or 2.

Remaining unused consonants (excluding all eliminated ones):  
C, D, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in “UTS” with U in position 1 or 2 and only the remaining consonants for the other slots.

Try U in position 1:  
U _ _ T S  
Possible consonants for positions 2 and 3: C, D, H, K, P, V, W, etc.

Common words:  
- “UCKTS” – not valid  
- “UDOTS” – not valid  
- “UHCTS” – not valid  

Try U in position 2:  
_ U _ T S  
Possible consonants for positions 1 and 3:

- Position 3: same set  

Scanning the dictionary space, the only common word that fits is  
“PUDTS” – but D is allowed and it’s a valid word (though rare).  
Another candidate: “HUSTS” – but S is already in position 5 and T in 4, so this would duplicate S.  
Actually, “HUSTS” is not valid because it would have S in position 4, conflicting with T.  

The only valid, albeit uncommon, word left is “PUDTS”.  
However, let’s double-check: P, U, D, T, S – all letters are allowed and fit the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “PUDTS”.
