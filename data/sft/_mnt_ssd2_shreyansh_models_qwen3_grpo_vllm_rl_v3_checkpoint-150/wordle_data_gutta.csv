### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE
- AROSE
- ARIEL
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 distinct high-frequency letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a common word. This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x) – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “CLOAN” (though that’s not a common word). A better, more common word is “PLANT” – but it has an A in position 4, which is allowed, and uses P, L, N, T which are all new letters. However, “PLANT” has an A in position 4, which is fine.

Another good option is “TUNAM” (not a word), or “COBNA” (not a word). The best common word seems to be “PLANT”.

But let’s double-check:
- PLANT: P, L, A, N, T – A is in position 3 (not position 1), and none of R, I, S, E are present. This seems valid.

So I’ll go with PLANT.

From the new feedback on PLANT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in pos 1 or 3), T (not in pos 5).

We still need to test other common letters like C, O, U, D, M, Y, etc. We want a word that:
1. Contains A and T in allowable positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try a word that places A and T in fresh spots while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “COATY”:
- C, O, A, T, Y – none of R, I, S, E, P, L, N are present.
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A(-) in PLANT meant A not in 3; so this would conflict). Oops, can’t use A in 3 again.

Next candidate: “MOUNT” – but O and U are new, N is already ruled out.

Next: “COUTH” – C, O, U, T, H – none of the forbidden letters, and T is in position 4 (allowed), A is missing, so we don’t get info on A.

We need a word that contains both A and T in allowed positions. Let’s try “CATTY” – but T is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 2 conflicts (A can’t be in 2 if it wasn’t in 1 or 3 before? Wait, A was only ruled out of 1 and 3, so 2 and 4 are open. So A in 2 is fine. But CATTY has two Ts, which wastes a letter.

Better: “CATCH” – but C, A, T, C, H – two Cs, and A in 2, T in 3. But C is new, H is new. But we already know T is not in 5, so T in 3 is fine. However, CATCH has two Cs, which is okay but not ideal for info.

Another approach: use a word with A in 2 or 4 and T in 1,2,3,4. Let’s try “TACIT” – but I is ruled out.

“TABOR” – but O is new, B is new, but R is ruled out.

“TAWNY” – Y is new, W is new, A in 2, T in 1. This seems good:
- T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), W and Y new, N ruled out but N isn’t used here.
- Letters: T, A, W, N, Y – N is ruled out, so N can’t be in the word. But TAWNY has N, so this is invalid.

Oops, N is already ruled out. Let’s avoid N.

“TAMMY” – T, A, M, M, Y – A in 2, T in 1, M and Y new. This works:
- No forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).

So TAMMY seems valid.

But TAMMY has two Ms, which is okay but not ideal for info. Let’s try “TACET” – but E is ruled out.

“TAUNT” – but N is ruled out.

“TAXON” – N ruled out.

“TAPAS” – P and S ruled out.

“TARDY” – R and D, Y – R ruled out.

“TAWER” – R ruled out.

“TAWNY” – N ruled out.

“TAHIT” – H, I – I ruled out.

“TALUK” – L ruled out.

“TAMAL” – L ruled out.

“TAMMY” seems the best so far.

But let’s try “COAST” – but S ruled out.

“COMAT” – O, M, A, T – A in 3 (ruled out), so no.

“COTTA” – T in 4, A in 5 – both positions allowed. Letters: C, O, T, T, A – two Ts, but valid. C and O new.

But A in 5 is allowed (was only ruled out of 1 and 3). T in 4 is allowed (was only ruled out of 5). This gives us info on C and O.

Between TAMMY and COTTA, COTTA introduces more new letters (C, O) and has valid positions for A and T.

So I’ll go with COTTA.

But wait, COTTA has two Ts – not ideal. Let’s try “COMAT” – but A in 3 is ruled out.

“COBIA” – I ruled out.

“COAST” – S ruled out.

“CUBAT” – U, B new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CYMAT” – Y, C, M new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CATTY” – two Ts.

“CAMPT” – P ruled out.

“CARAT” – R ruled out.

“CAVAT” – V new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CABOT” – B, O new, A in 2, T in 4. This seems good:
- C, A, B, O, T – none of the forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed).

So CABOT is a valid choice.

CABOT is a real word (though proper noun, it’s accepted in some word lists). If not, alternatives: CAVIT – but I ruled out.

“CAVIT” – I ruled out.

“CAVUM” – U, M new, A in 2, T in 4. Valid:
- C, A, V, U, M – all new letters.
- A in 2, T in 4 – positions allowed.

But we don’t have info on V yet.

Between CABOT and CAVUM, CAVUM introduces V and U, giving more info.

So I’ll go with CAVUM.

But CAVUM might be obscure. Let’s try “CABOT”.

Actually, CABOT is a valid 5-letter word in most word lists.

So CABOT is the best next guess.

But let’s double-check:
- Letters in CABOT: C, A, B, O, T.
- Ruled out letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in the word (not in 1 or 3), here in 2 – allowed.
- T is in the word (not in 5), here in 4 – allowed.
- C, B, O are new letters.

This seems optimal.

“COMAT” – O, M, A, T – A in 3 (ruled out), so no.

“COTTA” – T in 4, A in 5 – both positions allowed. Letters: C, O, T, T, A – two Ts, but valid. C and O new.

But A in 5 is allowed (was only ruled out of 1 and 3). T in 4 is allowed (was only ruled out of 5). This gives us info on C and O.

Between TAMMY and COTTA, COTTA introduces more new letters (C, O) and has valid positions for A and T.

So I’ll go with COTTA.

But wait, COTTA has two Ts – not ideal. Let’s try “COMAT” – but A in 3 is ruled out.

“COBIA” – I ruled out.

“COAST” – S ruled out.

“CUBAT” – U, B new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CYMAT” – Y, C, M new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CATTY” – two Ts.

“CAMPT” – P ruled out.

“CARAT” – R ruled out.

“CAVAT” – V new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CABOT” – B, O new, A in 2, T in 4. This seems good:
- C, A, B, O, T – none of the forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed).

So CABOT is a valid choice.

CABOT is a real word (though proper noun, it’s accepted in some word lists). If not, alternatives: CAVIT – but I ruled out.

“CAVIT” – I ruled out.

“CAVUM” – U, M new, A in 2, T in 4. Valid:
- C, A, V, U, M – all new letters.
- A in 2, T in 4 – positions allowed.

But we don’t have info on V yet.

Between CABOT and CAVUM, CAVUM introduces V and U, giving more info.

So I’ll go with CAVUM.

But CAVUM might be obscure. Let’s try “CABOT”.

Actually, CABOT is a valid 5-letter word in most word lists.

So CABOT is the best next guess.

But let’s double-check:
- Letters in CABOT: C, A, B, O, T.
- Ruled out letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in the word (not in 1 or 3), here in 2 – allowed.
- T is in the word (not in 5), here in 4 – allowed.
- C, B, O are new letters.

This seems optimal.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE
- AROSE
- ARIEL
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 distinct high-frequency letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a common word. This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x) – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “CLOAN” (though that’s not a common word). A better, more common word is “PLANT” – but it has an A in position 4, which is allowed, and uses P, L, N, T which are all new letters. However, “PLANT” has an A in position 4, which is fine.

Another good option is “TUNAM” (not a word), or “COBNA” (not a word). The best common word seems to be “PLANT”.

But let’s double-check:
- PLANT: P, L, A, N, T – A is in position 3 (not position 1), and none of R, I, S, E are present. This seems valid.

So I’ll go with PLANT.

<guess>PLANT</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PLANT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in pos 1 or 3), T (not in pos 5).

We still need to test other common letters like C, O, U, D, M, Y, etc. We want a word that:
1. Contains A and T in allowable positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try a word that places A and T in fresh spots while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “COATY”:
- C, O, A, T, Y – none of R, I, S, E, P, L, N are present.
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A(-) in PLANT meant A not in 3; so this would conflict). Oops, can’t use A in 3 again.

Next candidate: “MOUNT” – but O and U are new, N is already ruled out.

Next: “COUTH” – C, O, U, T, H – none of the forbidden letters, and T is in position 4 (allowed), A is missing, so we don’t get info on A.

We need a word that contains both A and T in allowed positions. Let’s try “CATTY” – but T is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 2 conflicts (A can’t be in 2 if it wasn’t in 1 or 3 before? Wait, A was only ruled out of 1 and 3, so 2 and 4 are open. So A in 2 is fine. But CATTY has two Ts, which wastes a letter.

Better: “CATCH” – but C, A, T, C, H – two Cs, and A in 2, T in 3. But C is new, H is new. But we already know T is not in 5, so T in 3 is fine. However, CATCH has two Cs, which is okay but not ideal for info.

Another approach: use a word with A in 2 or 4 and T in 1,2,3,4. Let’s try “TACIT” – but I is ruled out.

“TABOR” – but O is new, B is new, but R is ruled out.

“TAWNY” – Y is new, W is new, A in 2, T in 1. This seems good:
- T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), W and Y new, N ruled out but N isn’t used here.
- Letters: T, A, W, N, Y – N is ruled out, so N can’t be in the word. But TAWNY has N, so this is invalid.

Oops, N is already ruled out. Let’s avoid N.

“TAMMY” – T, A, M, M, Y – A in 2, T in 1, M and Y new. This works:
- No forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).

So TAMMY seems valid.

But TAMMY has two Ms, which is okay but not ideal for info. Let’s try “TACET” – but E is ruled out.

“TAUNT” – but N is ruled out.

“TAXON” – N ruled out.

“TAPAS” – P and S ruled out.

“TARDY” – R and D, Y – R ruled out.

“TAWER” – R ruled out.

“TAWNY” – N ruled out.

“TAHIT” – H, I – I ruled out.

“TALUK” – L ruled out.

“TAMAL” – L ruled out.

“TAMMY” seems the best so far.

But let’s try “COAST” – but S ruled out.

“COMAT” – O, M, A, T – A in 3 (ruled out), so no.

“COTTA” – T in 4, A in 5 – both positions allowed. Letters: C, O, T, T, A – two Ts, but valid. C and O new.

“CAMPT” – P ruled out.

“CARAT” – R ruled out.

“CAVAT” – V new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CABOT” – B, O new, A in 2, T in 4. This seems good:

- A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed).

So CABOT is a valid choice.

CABOT is a real word (though proper noun, it’s accepted in some word lists). If not, alternatives: CAVIT – but I ruled out.

“CAVIT” – I ruled out.

“CAVUM” – U, M new, A in 2, T in 4. Valid:

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE
- AROSE
- ARIEL
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 distinct high-frequency letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a common word. This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x) – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “CLOAN” (though that’s not a common word). A better, more common word is “PLANT” – but it has an A in position 4, which is allowed, and uses P, L, N, T which are all new letters. However, “PLANT” has an A in position 4, which is fine.

Another good option is “TUNAM” (not a word), or “COBNA” (not a word). The best common word seems to be “PLANT”.

But let’s double-check:
- PLANT: P, L, A, N, T – A is in position 3 (not position 1), and none of R, I, S, E are present. This seems valid.

So I’ll go with PLANT.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PLANT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in pos 1 or 3), T (not in pos 5).

We still need to test other common letters like C, O, U, D, M, Y, etc. We want a word that:
1. Contains A and T in allowable positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try a word that places A and T in fresh spots while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “COATY”:
- C, O, A, T, Y – none of R, I, S, E, P, L, N are present.
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A(-) in PLANT meant A not in 3; so this would conflict). Oops, can’t use A in 3 again.

Next candidate: “MOUNT” – but O and U are new, N is already ruled out.

Next: “COUTH” – C, O, U, T, H – none of the forbidden letters, and T is in position 4 (allowed), A is missing, so we don’t get info on A.

We need a word that contains both A and T in allowed positions. Let’s try “CATTY” – but T is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 2 conflicts (A can’t be in 2 if it wasn’t in 1 or 3 before? Wait, A was only ruled out of 1 and 3, so 2 and 4 are open. So A in 2 is fine. But CATTY has two Ts, which wastes a letter.

Better: “CATCH” – but C, A, T, C, H – two Cs, and A in 2, T in 3. But C is new, H is new. But we already know T is not in 5, so T in 3 is fine. However, CATCH has two Cs, which is okay but not ideal for info.

Another approach: use a word with A in 2 or 4 and T in 1,2,3,4. Let’s try “TACIT” – but I is ruled out.

“TABOR” – but O is new, B is new, but R is ruled out.

“TAWNY” – Y is new, W is new, A in 2, T in 1. This seems good:
- T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), W and Y new, N ruled out but N isn’t used here.
- Letters: T, A, W, N, Y – N is ruled out, so N can’t be in the word. But TAWNY has N, so this is invalid.

Oops, N is already ruled out. Let’s avoid N.

“TAMMY” – T, A, M, M, Y – A in 2, T in 1, M and Y new. This works:
- No forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).

So TAMMY seems valid.

But TAMMY has two Ms, which is okay but not ideal for info. Let’s try “TACET” – but E is ruled out.

“TAUNT” – but N is ruled out.

“TAXON” – N ruled out.

“TAPAS” – P and S ruled out.

“TARDY” – R and D, Y – R ruled out.

“TAWER” – R ruled out.

“TAWNY” – N ruled out.

“TAHIT” – H, I – I ruled out.

“TALUK” – L ruled out.

“TAMAL” – L ruled out.

“TAMMY” seems the best so far.

But let’s try “COAST” – but S ruled out.

“COMAT” – O, M, A, T – A in 3 (ruled out), so no.

“COTTA” – T in 4, A in 5 – both positions allowed. Letters: C, O, T, T, A – two Ts, but valid. C and O new.

But A in 5 is allowed (was only ruled out of 1 and 3). T in 4 is allowed (was only ruled out of 5). This gives us info on C and O.

Between TAMMY and COTTA, COTTA introduces more new letters (C, O) and has valid positions for A and T.

So I’ll go with COTTA.

But wait, COTTA has two Ts – not ideal. Let’s try “COMAT” – but A in 3 is ruled out.

“COBIA” – I ruled out.

“COAST” – S ruled out.

“CUBAT” – U, B new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CYMAT” – Y, C, M new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CATTY” – two Ts.

“CAMPT” – P ruled out.

“CARAT” – R ruled out.

“CAVAT” – V new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CABOT” – B, O new, A in 2, T in 4. This seems good:
- C, A, B, O, T – none of the forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed).

So CABOT is a valid choice.

CABOT is a real word (though proper noun, it’s accepted in some word lists). If not, alternatives: CAVIT – but I ruled out.

“CAVIT” – I ruled out.

“CAVUM” – U, M new, A in 2, T in 4. Valid:
- C, A, V, U, M – all new letters.
- A in 2, T in 4 – positions allowed.

But we don’t have info on V yet.

Between CABOT and CAVUM, CAVUM introduces V and U, giving more info.

So I’ll go with CAVUM.

But CAVUM might be obscure. Let’s try “CABOT”.

Actually, CABOT is a valid 5-letter word in most word lists.

So CABOT is the best next guess.

But let’s double-check:
- Letters in CABOT: C, A, B, O, T.
- Ruled out letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in the word (not in 1 or 3), here in 2 – allowed.
- T is in the word (not in 5), here in 4 – allowed.
- C, B, O are new letters.

This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on CABOT:

Summary of everything we know so far:
Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, C, B, O.
Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in positions 1, 2, 3), T (not in positions 5).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We still need to test new letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
1. Contains A and T in allowable positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Introduces as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and T in position 1:
Word form: T _ _ A _.
We need two more letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “TUDAY”:
- T in 1 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed).
- Letters: T, U, D, A, Y – none of the ruled-out letters are used.
- U, D, Y are all new letters.

Good candidates for position 4: same pool, but must make a valid word.

A real word that fits: “HUMTA” – but M and H are new, but “HUMTA” is not a standard word.

Another: “GUTSA” – but S is ruled out.

Another: “MUTTA” – but T is already used in position 3, and we don’t know if T repeats.

Another: “FUTON” – but O and N are ruled out.

Another: “JUMPA” – but P is ruled out.

Another: “WUTCH” – not a word.

Another: “VUTTA” – not a word.

Let’s try the second form: _ U _ T A
We need letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A real word: “HUMTA” – again not standard.

“JUMTA” – not a word.

“GUMTA” – not a word.

“MUMTA” – not a word.

“VUMTA” – not a word.

“WUMTA” – not a word.

“HUTTA” – T in 4, A in 5, U in 2, H in 1. “HUTTA” is a real word (a type of plant).

Check letters:
- H: new
- U: correct
- T: allowed in 4
- T: allowed to repeat? We don’t know if T repeats. But “HUTTA” has two Ts, which is possible.
- A: allowed in 5

This seems the best available option.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE
- AROSE
- ARIEL
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 distinct high-frequency letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a common word. This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x) – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “CLOAN” (though that’s not a common word). A better, more common word is “PLANT” – but it has an A in position 4, which is allowed, and uses P, L, N, T which are all new letters. However, “PLANT” has an A in position 4, which is fine.

Another good option is “TUNAM” (not a word), or “COBNA” (not a word). The best common word seems to be “PLANT”.

But let’s double-check:
- PLANT: P, L, A, N, T – A is in position 3 (not position 1), and none of R, I, S, E are present. This seems valid.

So I’ll go with PLANT.

<guess>PLANT</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PLANT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in pos 1 or 3), T (not in pos 5).

We still need to test other common letters like C, O, U, D, M, Y, etc. We want a word that:
1. Contains A and T in allowable positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try a word that places A and T in fresh spots while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “COATY”:
- C, O, A, T, Y – none of R, I, S, E, P, L, N are present.
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A(-) in PLANT meant A not in 3; so this would conflict). Oops, can’t use A in 3 again.

Next candidate: “MOUNT” – but O and U are new, N is already ruled out.

Next: “COUTH” – C, O, U, T, H – none of the forbidden letters, and T is in position 4 (allowed), A is missing, so we don’t get info on A.

We need a word that contains both A and T in allowed positions. Let’s try “CATTY” – but T is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 2 conflicts (A can’t be in 2 if it wasn’t in 1 or 3 before? Wait, A was only ruled out of 1 and 3, so 2 and 4 are open. So A in 2 is fine. But CATTY has two Ts, which wastes a letter.

Better: “CATCH” – but C, A, T, C, H – two Cs, and A in 2, T in 3. But C is new, H is new. But we already know T is not in 5, so T in 3 is fine. However, CATCH has two Cs, which is okay but not ideal for info.

Another approach: use a word with A in 2 or 4 and T in 1,2,3,4. Let’s try “TACIT” – but I is ruled out.

“TABOR” – but O is new, B is new, but R is ruled out.

“TAWNY” – Y is new, W is new, A in 2, T in 1. This seems good:
- T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), W and Y new, N ruled out but N isn’t used here.
- Letters: T, A, W, N, Y – N is ruled out, so N can’t be in the word. But TAWNY has N, so this is invalid.

Oops, N is already ruled out. Let’s avoid N.

“TAMMY” – T, A, M, M, Y – A in 2, T in 1, M and Y new. This works:
- No forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).

So TAMMY seems valid.

But TAMMY has two Ms, which is okay but not ideal for info. Let’s try “TACET” – but E is ruled out.

“TAUNT” – but N is ruled out.

“TAXON” – N ruled out.

“TAPAS” – P and S ruled out.

“TARDY” – R and D, Y – R ruled out.

“TAWER” – R ruled out.

“TAWNY” – N ruled out.

“TAHIT” – H, I – I ruled out.

“TALUK” – L ruled out.

“TAMAL” – L ruled out.

“TAMMY” seems the best so far.

But let’s try “COAST” – but S ruled out.

“COMAT” – O, M, A, T – A in 3 (ruled out), so no.

“COTTA” – T in 4, A in 5 – both positions allowed. Letters: C, O, T, T, A – two Ts, but valid. C and O new.

But A in 5 is allowed (was only ruled out of 1 and 3). T in 4 is allowed (was only ruled out of 5). This gives us info on C and O.

Between TAMMY and COTTA, COTTA introduces more new letters (C, O) and has valid positions for A and T.

So I’ll go with COTTA.

But wait, COTTA has two Ts – not ideal. Let’s try “COMAT” – but A in 3 is ruled out.

“COBIA” – I ruled out.

“COAST” – S ruled out.

“CUBAT” – U, B new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CYMAT” – Y, C, M new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CATTY” – two Ts.

“CAMPT” – P ruled out.

“CARAT” – R ruled out.

“CAVAT” – V new, A in 3 ruled out.

“CABOT” – B, O new, A in 2, T in 4. This seems good:
- C, A, B, O, T – none of the forbidden letters.
- A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed).

So CABOT is a valid choice.

CABOT is a real word (though proper noun, it’s accepted in some word lists). If not, alternatives: CAVIT – but I ruled out.

“CAVIT” – I ruled out.

“CAVUM” – U, M new, A in 2, T in 4. Valid:
- C, A, V, U, M – all new letters.
- A in 2, T in 4 – positions allowed.

But we don’t have info on V yet.

Between CABOT and CAVUM, CAVUM introduces V and U, giving more info.

So I’ll go with CAVUM.

But CAVUM might be obscure. Let’s try “CABOT”.

Actually, CABOT is a valid 5-letter word in most word lists.

So CABOT is the best next guess.

But let’s double-check:
- Letters in CABOT: C, A, B, O, T.
- Ruled out letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in the word (not in 1 or 3), here in 2 – allowed.
- T is in the word (not in 5), here in 4 – allowed.
- C, B, O are new letters.

This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on CABOT:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 2.
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of everything we know so far:
Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, C, B, O.
Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in positions 1, 2, 3), T (not in positions 5).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We still need to test new letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
1. Contains A and T in allowable positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Introduces as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for A: 4, 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and T in position 1:
Word form: T _ _ A _.
We need two more letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “TUDAY”:
- T in 1 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed).
- Letters: T, U, D, A, Y – none of the ruled-out letters are used.
- U, D, Y are all new letters.

This seems like a strong choice.

- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

Summary of everything we now know:
Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, C, B, O, D, Y.
Letters that ARE in the word: U (fixed in position 2), A (somewhere except 1,2,3,4), T (somewhere except 1,5).

Therefore:
- Position 2 = U (locked).
- A must be in position 5 (since 1,2,3,4 are ruled out).
- T must be in position 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).

We still need to test new letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We want a word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Has A in position 5.
3. Has T in position 3 or 4.
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible word forms:
- _ U T _ A  (T in 3)
- _ U _ T A  (T in 4)

Let’s try the first form: _ U T _ A
We need two letters from the remaining pool for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidates for position 1: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Good candidates for position 4: same pool, but must make a valid word.

Another: “VUTTA” – not a word.

Let’s try the second form: _ U _ T A

Possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A real word: “HUMTA” – again not standard.

“JUMTA” – not a word.

From the feedback on HUTTA:
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in position 2 (already known).
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in position 3 (now locked).
- T(✓) – Second T is also in position 4 (so the word has two Ts in positions 3 and 4).
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 5 (already deduced).

Thus the word structure is: _ U T T A.

We still need a single letter for position 1, chosen from the letters not yet ruled out.  
Letters already excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, C, B, O, D, Y, H.

Remaining possible letters for position 1: F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, the only common English 5-letter word that matches the pattern _UTTA is “FUTTA” (though it’s not standard) and “GUTTA” (which is valid, meaning a drop of fluid).  
“GUTTA” is the more common word.

Check letters:
- G: not yet tested.
- U, T, T, A: all match the locked positions.

Therefore, the secret word must be GUTTA.
