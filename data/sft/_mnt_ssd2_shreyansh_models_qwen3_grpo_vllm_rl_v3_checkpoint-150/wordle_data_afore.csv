1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A somewhere, but NOT in position 3 (since A was in position 3 in SLATE).
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.

We now need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing A, and avoiding S, L, T.

Let’s try a word like “CRANE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains A in position 3, but we know A is not in position 3 (from SLATE feedback). So CRANE is invalid.

Next, try “RAISE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed).
- Contains S, which we know is not in the word (x). So RAISE is invalid.

Try “ADIEU”:

Try “FAKE” – too short.

Try “CARE” – too short.

Try “ABIDE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains A in position 1 (allowed).

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - S, L, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is in the word and is in position 5.

2. From ABIDE:
   - A is in position 1 (✓).
   - B, I, D are not in the word.
   - E is in position 5 (✓).

3. From ANGER:
   - A is in position 1 (✓).
   - N, G are not in the word.
   - E is in position 4 (-) — but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that E is in position 5 (✓ from both SLATE and ABIDE).

Wait, this is impossible. The feedback from ANGER says E is in position 4 but in the wrong place, while earlier feedback says E is in position 5. This must mean there's an error in my interpretation.

Re-reading the feedback carefully:
- SLATE: E(✓) means E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- ANGER: E(-) means E is in the word but in the wrong position. This contradicts the earlier ✓.

This suggests the feedback might have been mis-typed. Assuming the latest feedback is correct as given, let's proceed:

From ANGER:
- A(✓) position 1
- N(x) not in word
- G(x) not in word
- E(-) E is in word but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 5, matching the ✓ from SLATE)
- R(-) R is in word but not in position 5

Thus, the word is A _ _ _ E with letters not including S, L, T, B, I, D, N, G.

Possible letters left: C, F, H, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place R somewhere in positions 2-4 (since R is in word but not in position 5).

Possible words:
- A C R O E
- A F R O E
- A M P R E (but P is allowed, but we need to check)
- A H O R E
- A C R E (too short)
- A M B R E (B excluded)
- A R O R E (but R would be in position 2 and 4, possible)
- A C R O E (ACROE is not a valid word)

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with A and ending with E, containing R but not any excluded letters:

- AFORE (but O and R are allowed, F is allowed)
- AFORE: A F O R E — letters: A, F, O, R, E — none are excluded (S, L, T, B, I, D, N, G excluded). This fits.

Let's check:
- A(✓) position 1
- F (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- R (must be in word, and not in position 5, fits here)
- E (must be in position 5, fits here)

This seems correct.
