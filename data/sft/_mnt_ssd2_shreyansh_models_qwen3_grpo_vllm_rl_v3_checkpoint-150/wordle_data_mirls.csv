- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that covers as many of these common letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me 5 distinct common letters that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

   – S is in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ S

- Places R and I in new positions.  
- Introduces two fresh common consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

Good unused common letters: N, L, C, D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is “CRISP” – but P is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “GRINS” – uses G, R, I, N, S.  
- S is fixed in slot 5.

Current constraints:

Letters known to be in the word (and their positions):
- S is definitely in position 5.

Letters known to be in the word but NOT in these positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 2 (from GRINS). So R can only be in 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4. So I can only be in 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is excluded from GRINS), so I can be in 1 or 2.

Letters known NOT to be in the word at all:
A, O, E, T, P, G, N.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S
and must contain R and I somewhere in the first four positions.

Possible positions:
- R can be in 1 or 4
- I can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 1
Then the word is R _ _ _ S
I must be in 2 or 3 (since 4 is excluded for I)
Possible: R I _ _ S or R _ I _ S

Case 2: R in position 4
Then the word is _ _ _ R S
I must be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)
Possible: I _ _ R S, _ I _ R S, _ _ I R S

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, E, T, P, G, N), and introduces new common letters to narrow down further.

Looking at remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Let's try ""DRIPS"" - but P is excluded.
""CRISP"" - P excluded.
""BRISK"" - B, R, I, S, K. This looks good:
- B is new
- R is in position 2 (but R can't be in position 2 from GRINS feedback - wait, in GRINS R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2. So BRISK is invalid as R would be in position 2.)

Next option: ""FRISK"" - F, R, I, S, K
- R is in position 2 (invalid - same issue)

""CRWTH"" - but W is less common and T is excluded.

""BRUIS"" - but U is in position 4, which is allowed for U, but I would be in position 3 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid)

""DIRKS"" - D, I, R, K, S
- R is in position 3 (invalid from GRINS feedback)

""FRIAR"" - but R is in position 4 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), but A is excluded.

""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""DRIPS"" - P excluded.

""CRISP"" - P excluded.

""BRUIS"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

Hmm, seems like many options have R in position 2 which is invalid. Let's re-examine possible placements.

From GRINS feedback: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2.
From TRIPS feedback: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2.
From AROSE feedback: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2.

So R cannot be in position 2.

Also, from GRINS: I was in position 3 and got ""-"", so I cannot be in position 3.
From TRIPS: I was in position 3 and got ""-"", so I cannot be in position 3.
From AROSE: I was not present, so no restriction from there.

Thus:
- R can be in 1 or 4
- I can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

Let's try R in position 1:
Word: R _ _ _ S
I must be in 2 or 3
Possible: R I _ _ S or R _ I _ S

For R I _ _ S:
Need two more letters, not excluded. Common ones: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, Y
Possible: R I D G S - but G is excluded.
R I C K S - C, K are allowed: RICKS (valid word)

For R _ I _ S:
R _ I _ S: need letters for 2 and 4. 2 can be any allowed, 4 can be any allowed.
R B I D S - valid word: RIBDS? Not valid.
R U I D S - not a word.
R U I L S - valid word: RUILS? Not valid.
R I U L S - not valid.

So RICKS seems possible.

Let's check other options with R in position 4:
Word: _ _ _ R S
I must be in 1, 2, or 3
Possible: I _ _ R S, _ I _ R S, _ _ I R S

I _ _ R S:
I B C R S - not a word.
I C K R S - not a word.
I D L R S - not a word.

_ I _ R S:
B I C R S - not a word.
D I L R S - not a word.

_ _ I R S:
B C I R S - not a word.

Thus, RICKS seems the most promising valid word fitting all constraints:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (allowed)
- C and K are new common letters
- S is in position 5 (required)
- No excluded letters used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that covers as many of these common letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me 5 distinct common letters that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all  
- R (-) – in the word but not in position 2  
- O (x) – not in the word  
- S (-) – in the word but not in position 4  
- E (x) – not in the word  

So the secret word contains R and S, but not A, O, or E.  
Also, R is not in position 2 and S is not in position 4.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S in different positions.  
2. Avoids A, O, E.  
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T, I, P are new letters.  
- R moves to position 3.  
- S moves to position 5.  
All letters are distinct and none of the excluded letters (A, O, E) are used.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, S, I  
   – S is in the correct position (position 5).  
   – R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and the remaining letters must include R and I somewhere in the first four slots.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4 (cannot be 2,3)  
Possible positions for I: 1,2,3 (cannot be 4)

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps S in position 5.  
- Places R and I in new positions.  
- Introduces two fresh common consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

Good unused common letters: N, L, C, D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is “CRISP” – but P is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “GRINS” – uses G, R, I, N, S.  
- S is fixed in slot 5.  
- R is in slot 2 (a new position).  
- I is in slot 3 (a new position).  
- G and N are new letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that covers as many of these common letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me 5 distinct common letters that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all  
- R (-) – in the word but not in position 2  
- O (x) – not in the word  
- S (-) – in the word but not in position 4  
- E (x) – not in the word  

So the secret word contains R and S, but not A, O, or E.  
Also, R is not in position 2 and S is not in position 4.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S in different positions.  
2. Avoids A, O, E.  
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T, I, P are new letters.  
- R moves to position 3.  
- S moves to position 5.  
All letters are distinct and none of the excluded letters (A, O, E) are used.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, S, I  
   – S is in the correct position (position 5).  
   – R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and the remaining letters must include R and I somewhere in the first four slots.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4 (cannot be 2,3)  
Possible positions for I: 1,2,3 (cannot be 4)

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps S in position 5.  
- Places R and I in new positions.  
- Introduces two fresh common consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

Good unused common letters: N, L, C, D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is “CRISP” – but P is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “GRINS” – uses G, R, I, N, S.  
- S is fixed in slot 5.  
- R is in slot 2 (a new position).  
- I is in slot 3 (a new position).  
- G and N are new letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

Current constraints:

Letters known to be in the word (and their positions):
- S is definitely in position 5.

Letters known to be in the word but NOT in these positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 2 (from GRINS). So R can only be in 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4. So I can only be in 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is excluded from GRINS), so I can be in 1 or 2.

Letters known NOT to be in the word at all:
A, O, E, T, P, G, N.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S
and must contain R and I somewhere in the first four positions.

Possible positions:
- R can be in 1 or 4
- I can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 1
Then the word is R _ _ _ S
I must be in 2 or 3 (since 4 is excluded for I)
Possible: R I _ _ S or R _ I _ S

Case 2: R in position 4
Then the word is _ _ _ R S
I must be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)
Possible: I _ _ R S, _ I _ R S, _ _ I R S

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, E, T, P, G, N), and introduces new common letters to narrow down further.

Looking at remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Let's try ""DRIPS"" - but P is excluded.
""CRISP"" - P excluded.
""BRISK"" - B, R, I, S, K. This looks good:
- B is new
- R is in position 2 (but R can't be in position 2 from GRINS feedback - wait, in GRINS R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2. So BRISK is invalid as R would be in position 2.)

Next option: ""FRISK"" - F, R, I, S, K
- R is in position 2 (invalid - same issue)

""CRWTH"" - but W is less common and T is excluded.

""BRUIS"" - but U is in position 4, which is allowed for U, but I would be in position 3 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid)

""DIRKS"" - D, I, R, K, S
- R is in position 3 (invalid from GRINS feedback)

""FRIAR"" - but R is in position 4 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), but A is excluded.

""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""DRIPS"" - P excluded.

""CRISP"" - P excluded.

""BRUIS"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)

Hmm, seems like many options have R in position 2 which is invalid. Let's re-examine possible placements.

From GRINS feedback: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2.
From TRIPS feedback: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2.
From AROSE feedback: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2.

So R cannot be in position 2.

Also, from GRINS: I was in position 3 and got ""-"", so I cannot be in position 3.
From TRIPS: I was in position 3 and got ""-"", so I cannot be in position 3.
From AROSE: I was not present, so no restriction from there.

Thus:
- R can be in 1 or 4
- I can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

Let's try R in position 1:
Word: R _ _ _ S
I must be in 2 or 3
Possible: R I _ _ S or R _ I _ S

For R I _ _ S:
Need two more letters, not excluded. Common ones: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, Y
Possible: R I D G S - but G is excluded.
R I C K S - C, K are allowed: RICKS (valid word)

For R _ I _ S:
R _ I _ S: need letters for 2 and 4. 2 can be any allowed, 4 can be any allowed.
R B I D S - valid word: RIBDS? Not valid.
R U I D S - not a word.
R U I L S - valid word: RUILS? Not valid.
R I U L S - not valid.

So RICKS seems possible.

Let's check other options with R in position 4:
Word: _ _ _ R S
I must be in 1, 2, or 3
Possible: I _ _ R S, _ I _ R S, _ _ I R S

I _ _ R S:
I B C R S - not a word.
I C K R S - not a word.
I D L R S - not a word.

_ I _ R S:
B I C R S - not a word.
D I L R S - not a word.

_ _ I R S:
B C I R S - not a word.

Thus, RICKS seems the most promising valid word fitting all constraints:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (allowed)
- C and K are new common letters
- S is in position 5 (required)
- No excluded letters used.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4: F, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ I R _ S.

Possible candidates:
- F I R _ S → FIRMS (but M is allowed)

- M I R _ S → MIRIS (not common)
- U I R _ S → UIRS? Not valid
- Y I R _ S → YIRIS (not common)

Looking at common words, ""FIRMS"" fits the pattern _ I R _ S and uses only allowed letters:
- F: not ruled out
- I: correct position 2
- R: correct position 3
- M: not ruled out
- S: correct position 5

""FIRMS"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.
