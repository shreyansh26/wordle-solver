### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, N, E (and possibly other letters)
2. Does NOT use C or A
3. Places R, N, E in positions they didn’t occupy in CRANE

- RENAL (but has A, which is excluded)
- RENNY (but has Y, and two Ns)

- Positions: _ _ N E _  (N at 3, E at 4)
- Letters to include: R
- Letters to exclude: C, A, T, O
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and TONER feedback)
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot)

Thus the word structure is: R _ N E _

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with R, has N in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is allowed, I is allowed)
- RINNE (but double N)
- RENNE (but double N)
- RINSE seems best: R I N S E

Check:
- R: position 1 (allowed, since it was in 2 and 5 before)
- I: new letter, not excluded
- N: position 3 (correct)
- S: new letter, not excluded
- E: position 4 (correct)

No excluded letters (C, A, T, O) are used.

From the three guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
   - Word contains R, N, E but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively.
   - Word does NOT contain C or A.

2. TONER → T(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓) R(-)
   - N is now in the correct position (position 3).
   - E is now in the correct position (position 4).
   - R is still in the word but not in position 5.
   - Word does NOT contain T or O.

3. RINSE → R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - R is now in the correct position (position 1).
   - I is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - N is already confirmed at position 3.
   - E is still supposed to be at position 4 (from TONER), but here it shows (-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This seems contradictory - unless there's an error in my interpretation.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

TONER feedback: N(✓) E(✓) - this means N is correct at position 3, E is correct at position 4.

RINSE feedback: R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(-) E(-)

The E(-) here is concerning because from TONER we thought E was fixed at position 4. The (-) suggests E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with it being at 4. But the feedback format shows the symbol for each position, so:

RINSE:
- R at position 1: ✓ (correct)
- I at position 2: ✓ (correct)
- N at position 3: ✓ (correct)
- S at position 4: (-) (S is in word but not at 4)
- E at position 5: (-) (E is in word but not at 5)

But from TONER we had E at position 4 as ✓, so E must be at position 4. This creates a contradiction unless I'm misunderstanding.

Ah! I see the issue. The feedback for TONER shows E(✓) which means E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). Therefore, in RINSE, when we place E at position 5, it should show (-) because it's in the word but not at 5, which aligns with E being at 4. Similarly, S is in the word but not at 4, so it must be at 5, but E is already at 4, so S would be at 5, but E must be at 4. This suggests the word structure is R I N E S.

Let's check this:
- R at 1: ✓
- I at 2: ✓
- N at 3: ✓
- E at 4: ✓ (from TONER)
- S at 5: (-) from RINSE, which is consistent because S is in the word but not at 4 (it's at 5)

This seems to fit all feedback:
- Word: R I N E S
- No C, A, T, O
- R, I, N positions confirmed
- S is in the word at position 5
- E is at position 4

This appears to be the only possible arrangement given all feedback.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must be R I N E S. All positions are now confirmed except for S, which is in the word but not at position 4, and E, which is in the word but not at position 5 (from RINSE). The only remaining position for S is 5, making the word R I N E S.
