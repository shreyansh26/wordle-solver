1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping us narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let's go with SLATE as our first guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, we must avoid those letters entirely in our next guess.

We want a new 5-letter word that:
- uses none of S, L, A, T, E  
- still contains common letters so we can quickly identify hits.

Good remaining high-frequency letters: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q (but we’ll stick to common ones).

A strong second-guess candidate is “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y – none of these were in SLATE.  
- It contains four very common consonants (C, R, N, Y) plus O, giving us broad coverage.

Another excellent choice would be “CHORD” or “BRICK”, but “CRONY” is concise and covers a nice spread of letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping us narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let's go with SLATE as our first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, we must avoid those letters entirely in our next guess.

We want a new 5-letter word that:
- uses none of S, L, A, T, E  
- still contains common letters so we can quickly identify hits.

Good remaining high-frequency letters: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q (but we’ll stick to common ones).

A strong second-guess candidate is “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y – none of these were in SLATE.  
- It contains four very common consonants (C, R, N, Y) plus O, giving us broad coverage.

Another excellent choice would be “CHORD” or “BRICK”, but “CRONY” is concise and covers a nice spread of letters.

Let’s choose CRONY.

Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → all letters x (none in the word)
2. CRONY → C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) Y(✓)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 2
- Letter Y is in the word and is in position 5

Therefore the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ Y and must contain R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that contains R but not in position 2, and avoids all the excluded letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z, J, Q (but we’ll stick to common ones).

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ R _ _ Y: DRIPY, GRIMY, PRIMY, BRINY, FRISK (but K is allowed, S is excluded), etc.
- _ _ R _ Y: BURRY, DURRY, GURRY, HURRY, PURRY, etc. (but U is allowed, R is in position 3)
- _ _ _ R Y: FURRY, HURRY, PURRY, etc. (R in position 4)

Among these, “BURRY” fits:
- B, U, R, R, Y
- No excluded letters
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R is not in position 2)
- Y is in position 5 (matches)
- It’s a common word

Another good one is “PURRY”, but BURRY is more common.

Let’s go with BURRY.
