For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is NOT in the 4th position.

We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.  
We also know N is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Good letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong next guess should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 4).
2. Use other common letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – N is in position 4 again, so skip.
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – C is out, skip.
- NINNY – repeats N, not ideal.
- BLUNT (B, L, U, N, T) – N in position 4, skip.
- SLUMP – no N.
- STUMP – no N.
- STONY – already skipped.

Let’s pick a word where N is NOT in position 4.  
“SLUMP” doesn’t contain N.  
“BLUNT” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“STONY” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“SOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“TONIC” has C – bad.  
“MOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  

Another candidate: “BLOND” – N in position 4, skip.  
“SNOUT” – N in position 2, which is allowed.  
Letters: S, N, O, U, T – none of C, R, A, E.  
N is in position 2, which is fine.

So “SNOUT” seems good.

Alternatively, “SLUNG” – N in position 3, letters S, L, U, N, G.  
Also good.

Between SNOUT and SLUNG, SNOUT covers more common letters (S, N, O, U, T).

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters confirmed IN the word: N, O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- N is not in position 2 (from SNOUT) and not in position 4 (from CRANE)  
- O is now confirmed in position 3 (from SNOUT)  

So the pattern so far looks like: _ _ O _ _

Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out and O is fixed)

We still need to place N somewhere. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 3 is already O, so N must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
From SNOUT we saw N in position 2 is bad (it was marked “-”), so N must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s build candidate words:
- If N is in position 1: N _ O _ _
- If N is in position 5: _ _ O _ N

We also want to test the vowel I (only remaining vowel not yet used).

Try N _ O _ _ first:
N I O _ _ → NIOSC, NIOBE, NIONS (but NIONS repeats N).  
N I O D _ → NIOD_ not valid.  
N I O B_ → NIOBE (valid word).  
N I O G_ → NIOG_ not valid.  
N I O L_ → NIOLE? Not valid.  
N I O M_ → NIONM? Not valid.  
N I O S_ → NIOS_ not valid.  

Try _ _ O _ N:
- B I O L N – not a word.  
- D I O L N – not a word.  
- F I O L N – not a word.  
- H I O L N – not a word.  
- L I O N _ – LION_ but we need 5 letters ending N.  
- S I O N _ – SI O N _ → SI O N T is 4 letters.  
- S I O N E – but E is out.  
- S I O N S – S is already tested in SNOUT and was “-”, so S is in word but not position 1.  
- S I O N T – T is out.  

Another angle: use common 5-letter words with O in 3rd and N in 1st or 5th, avoiding banned letters.

Valid candidates:
- N I O B E – but E is out.  
- N I O B I – NIOBI? Not valid.  
- N I O N _ – NIONS? Repeats N.  
- N I O S T – NI O S T? Not valid.  
- N I O D E – E out.  

Back to _ _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- B I O N D – B I O N D → BIOND? Not common.  
- P I O N E – E out.  
- D I O N N – not valid.  
- G I O N T – T out.  

Realize we missed: N I O B E is invalid (E).  
Valid word: N I O N A – but A is out.  
Valid word: N I O S H – NIOSH (valid, but uncommon).  

Better: S _ O _ N pattern.  
S is in word but not position 1 (from SNOUT), so S could be 2, 4, or 5.  
But 5 is N, so S could be 2 or 4.

Try S _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- S L O P N – not valid.  
- S P O K N – SP O K N → SP O K N is 5 letters: S P O K N.  
  Check: S (allowed), P (new), O (fixed), K (new), N (fixed).  
  SP O K N is a valid English word.

This uses new letters P and K, keeps O in 3 and N in 5, and S is in 1 (but we know S is in word but not position 1 – so SP O K N would place S in 1, which contradicts SNOUT feedback that S was “-” (in word but not position 1).  
Thus S cannot be in position 1.  

Next: _ S O _ N:
- B S O N E – E out.  
- D S O N E – E out.  
- F S O N E – E out.  
- H S O N E – E out.  
- L S O N E – E out.  
- M S O N E – E out.  
- P S O N E – E out.  
- V S O N E – E out.  
- W S O N E – E out.  

Try _ _ O S N:
- B L O S N – not valid.  
- D L O S N – not valid.

<guess>BLOWN</guess>",BLOWN,"From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters confirmed IN the word: N, O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- N is not in position 2 (from SNOUT) and not in position 4 (from CRANE)  
- O is now confirmed in position 3 (from SNOUT)  

So the pattern so far looks like: _ _ O _ _

Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out and O is fixed)

We still need to place N somewhere. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 3 is already O, so N must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
From SNOUT we saw N in position 2 is bad (it was marked “-”), so N must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s build candidate words:
- If N is in position 1: N _ O _ _
- If N is in position 5: _ _ O _ N

We also want to test the vowel I (only remaining vowel not yet used).

Try N _ O _ _ first:
N I O _ _ → NIOSC, NIOBE, NIONS (but NIONS repeats N).  
N I O D _ → NIOD_ not valid.  
N I O B_ → NIOBE (valid word).  
N I O G_ → NIOG_ not valid.  
N I O L_ → NIOLE? Not valid.  
N I O M_ → NIONM? Not valid.  
N I O S_ → NIOS_ not valid.  

Try _ _ O _ N:
- B I O L N – not a word.  
- D I O L N – not a word.  
- F I O L N – not a word.  
- H I O L N – not a word.  
- L I O N _ – LION_ but we need 5 letters ending N.  
- S I O N _ – SI O N _ → SI O N T is 4 letters.  
- S I O N E – but E is out.  
- S I O N S – S is already tested in SNOUT and was “-”, so S is in word but not position 1.  
- S I O N T – T is out.  

Another angle: use common 5-letter words with O in 3rd and N in 1st or 5th, avoiding banned letters.

Valid candidates:
- N I O B E – but E is out.  
- N I O B I – NIOBI? Not valid.  
- N I O N _ – NIONS? Repeats N.  
- N I O S T – NI O S T? Not valid.  
- N I O D E – E out.  

Back to _ _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- B I O N D – B I O N D → BIOND? Not common.  
- P I O N E – E out.  
- D I O N N – not valid.  
- G I O N T – T out.  

Realize we missed: N I O B E is invalid (E).  
Valid word: N I O N A – but A is out.  
Valid word: N I O S H – NIOSH (valid, but uncommon).  

Better: S _ O _ N pattern.  
S is in word but not position 1 (from SNOUT), so S could be 2, 4, or 5.  
But 5 is N, so S could be 2 or 4.

Try S _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- S L O P N – not valid.  
- S P O K N – SP O K N → SP O K N is 5 letters: S P O K N.  
  Check: S (allowed), P (new), O (fixed), K (new), N (fixed).  
  SP O K N is a valid English word.

This uses new letters P and K, keeps O in 3 and N in 5, and S is in 1 (but we know S is in word but not position 1 – so SP O K N would place S in 1, which contradicts SNOUT feedback that S was “-” (in word but not position 1).  
Thus S cannot be in position 1.  

Next: _ S O _ N:
- B S O N E – E out.  
- D S O N E – E out.  
- F S O N E – E out.  
- H S O N E – E out.  
- L S O N E – E out.  
- M S O N E – E out.  
- P S O N E – E out.  
- V S O N E – E out.  
- W S O N E – E out.  

Try _ _ O S N:
- B L O S N – not valid.  
- D L O S N – not valid.  
- F L O S N – not valid.  
- H L O S N – not valid.  
- M L O S N – not valid.  

Try N _ O S _:
- N I O S H – valid, but uncommon.  
- N I O S E – E out.  

Try N _ O _ S:
- N I O B S – not valid.  
- N I O D S – not valid.  

Realize better candidate: B L O W N – but W is new, O in 3, N in 5, and B, L are new.  
Check letters: B, L, O, W, N – none are banned.  
B L O W N is a valid English word, fits _ _ O _ N pattern, and uses new letters B, L, W.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is NOT in the 4th position.

We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.  
We also know N is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Good letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong next guess should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 4).
2. Use other common letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – N is in position 4 again, so skip.
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – C is out, skip.
- NINNY – repeats N, not ideal.
- BLUNT (B, L, U, N, T) – N in position 4, skip.
- SLUMP – no N.
- STUMP – no N.
- STONY – already skipped.

Let’s pick a word where N is NOT in position 4.  
“SLUMP” doesn’t contain N.  
“BLUNT” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“STONY” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“SOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“TONIC” has C – bad.  
“MOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  

Another candidate: “BLOND” – N in position 4, skip.  
“SNOUT” – N in position 2, which is allowed.  
Letters: S, N, O, U, T – none of C, R, A, E.  
N is in position 2, which is fine.

So “SNOUT” seems good.

Alternatively, “SLUNG” – N in position 3, letters S, L, U, N, G.  
Also good.

Between SNOUT and SLUNG, SNOUT covers more common letters (S, N, O, U, T).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is NOT in the 4th position.

We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.  
We also know N is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Good letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong next guess should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 4).
2. Use other common letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – N is in position 4 again, so skip.
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – C is out, skip.
- NINNY – repeats N, not ideal.
- BLUNT (B, L, U, N, T) – N in position 4, skip.
- SLUMP – no N.
- STUMP – no N.
- STONY – already skipped.

Let’s pick a word where N is NOT in position 4.  
“SLUMP” doesn’t contain N.  
“BLUNT” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“STONY” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“SOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“TONIC” has C – bad.  
“MOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  

Another candidate: “BLOND” – N in position 4, skip.  
“SNOUT” – N in position 2, which is allowed.  
Letters: S, N, O, U, T – none of C, R, A, E.  
N is in position 2, which is fine.

So “SNOUT” seems good.

Alternatively, “SLUNG” – N in position 3, letters S, L, U, N, G.  
Also good.

Between SNOUT and SLUNG, SNOUT covers more common letters (S, N, O, U, T).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters confirmed IN the word: N, O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- N is not in position 2 (from SNOUT) and not in position 4 (from CRANE)  
- O is now confirmed in position 3 (from SNOUT)  

So the pattern so far looks like: _ _ O _ _

Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out and O is fixed)

We still need to place N somewhere. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 3 is already O, so N must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
From SNOUT we saw N in position 2 is bad (it was marked “-”), so N must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s build candidate words:
- If N is in position 1: N _ O _ _
- If N is in position 5: _ _ O _ N

We also want to test the vowel I (only remaining vowel not yet used).

Try N _ O _ _ first:
N I O _ _ → NIOSC, NIOBE, NIONS (but NIONS repeats N).  
N I O D _ → NIOD_ not valid.  
N I O B_ → NIOBE (valid word).  
N I O G_ → NIOG_ not valid.  
N I O L_ → NIOLE? Not valid.  
N I O M_ → NIONM? Not valid.  
N I O S_ → NIOS_ not valid.  

Try _ _ O _ N:
- B I O L N – not a word.  
- D I O L N – not a word.  
- F I O L N – not a word.  
- H I O L N – not a word.  
- L I O N _ – LION_ but we need 5 letters ending N.  
- S I O N _ – SI O N _ → SI O N T is 4 letters.  
- S I O N E – but E is out.  
- S I O N S – S is already tested in SNOUT and was “-”, so S is in word but not position 1.  
- S I O N T – T is out.  

Another angle: use common 5-letter words with O in 3rd and N in 1st or 5th, avoiding banned letters.

Valid candidates:
- N I O B E – but E is out.  
- N I O B I – NIOBI? Not valid.  
- N I O N _ – NIONS? Repeats N.  
- N I O S T – NI O S T? Not valid.  
- N I O D E – E out.  

Back to _ _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- B I O N D – B I O N D → BIOND? Not common.  
- P I O N E – E out.  
- D I O N N – not valid.  
- G I O N T – T out.  

Realize we missed: N I O B E is invalid (E).  
Valid word: N I O N A – but A is out.  
Valid word: N I O S H – NIOSH (valid, but uncommon).  

Better: S _ O _ N pattern.  
S is in word but not position 1 (from SNOUT), so S could be 2, 4, or 5.  
But 5 is N, so S could be 2 or 4.

Try S _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- S L O P N – not valid.  
- S P O K N – SP O K N → SP O K N is 5 letters: S P O K N.  
  Check: S (allowed), P (new), O (fixed), K (new), N (fixed).  
  SP O K N is a valid English word.

This uses new letters P and K, keeps O in 3 and N in 5, and S is in 1 (but we know S is in word but not position 1 – so SP O K N would place S in 1, which contradicts SNOUT feedback that S was “-” (in word but not position 1).  
Thus S cannot be in position 1.  

Next: _ S O _ N:
- B S O N E – E out.  
- D S O N E – E out.  
- F S O N E – E out.  
- H S O N E – E out.  
- L S O N E – E out.  
- M S O N E – E out.  
- P S O N E – E out.  
- V S O N E – E out.  
- W S O N E – E out.  

Try _ _ O S N:
- B L O S N – not valid.  
- D L O S N – not valid.  
- F L O S N – not valid.  
- H L O S N – not valid.  
- M L O S N – not valid.  

Try N _ O S _:
- N I O S H – valid, but uncommon.  
- N I O S E – E out.  

Try N _ O _ S:
- N I O B S – not valid.  
- N I O D S – not valid.  

Realize better candidate: B L O W N – but W is new, O in 3, N in 5, and B, L are new.  
Check letters: B, L, O, W, N – none are banned.  
B L O W N is a valid English word, fits _ _ O _ N pattern, and uses new letters B, L, W.

This seems optimal.

From the four guesses we now have:

Fixed letters:
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 1: N (✓)

Fixed pattern so far: N _ O _ _

Letters known to be in the word:
- N (position 1)
- O (position 3)
- I (must appear, but not in position 2)
- S (must appear, but not in position 4)

Letters known NOT in the word:
C, R, A, E, U, T, B, L, W, H

Remaining positions to fill: 2 and 5
Possible letters (excluding banned ones): D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y, plus I and S must be placed.

We have:
- I cannot be in position 2 (from NIOSH feedback: I(-))
- S cannot be in position 4 (already known), and position 4 is not S anyway because we have _ _ O _ _ and S must go to position 2 or 5.

So possible placements:
- I must go to position 5 (since it can't be in 2 and we've used 1,3)
- S must go to position 2

Thus the word must be: N S O _ I

But position 4 is still open and must be filled with a letter not yet used. From remaining letters (D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y), we need a valid 5-letter word.

Valid words fitting N S O _ I:
- N S O D I → NSODI? Not valid
- N S O F I → NSOFI? Not valid
- N S O G I → NSOGI? Not valid
- N S O K I → NSOKI? Not valid
- N S O M I → NSOMI? Not valid
- N S O P I → NSOPI? Not valid
- N S O V I → NSOVI? Not valid
- N S O Y I → NSOYI? Not valid

Realize we missed: N S O K I → NSOKI is not a word. Let me think differently.

Actually, positions 2 and 5 must be filled with I and S in some order, but:
- I cannot be in position 2 (from NIOSH)
- S cannot be in position 4 (already not applicable here)

So possible orders:
1. N I O S _ → but S would be in position 4, which is invalid (S cannot be in 4)
2. N S O I _ → S in 2, I in 5, but position 4 is open
3. N _ O I S → I in 5, S in 5? No, S must be in 2 or 5, but 5 is taken by I

Realize the only valid arrangement is N S O _ I with position 4 being a new letter. But none of the combinations seem valid.

Alternative approach: Maybe I is in position 5 and S is in position 2: N S O _ I
Looking for valid words: N S O K I → NSOKI is not valid. N S O M I → NSOMI is not valid.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words starting with NSO:
- NSO is not a common start. Maybe N S O G I → NSOGI is not valid.

Realize we might have missed a letter. From remaining letters: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y, and we must use I and S.

Let me try N I O S _ → but S would be in position 4, which is invalid.

Another possibility: N _ O I S → I in 5, S in 5? No.

Realize the correct placement must be N S O I _ → but position 5 is open, and we have N S O I _ with position 5 needing a letter, but we've used N, S, O, I.

Wait, we have to use exactly the letters known to be in the word: N, O, I, S plus one new letter.

So the word must contain N, O, I, S and one new letter, arranged as N _ O _ _ with I and S in positions 2 and 5.

Thus possible words:
- N I O S _ → but S would be in 4, invalid
- N S O I _ → S in 2, I in 5, position 4 needs a letter. From remaining: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y

Valid word: N S O I D → NSOID? Not valid
N S O I F → NSOIF? Not valid
N S O I G → NSOIG? Not valid
N S O I K → NSOIK? Not valid
N S O I M → NSOIM? Not valid
N S O I P → NSOIP? Not valid
N S O I V → NSOIV? Not valid
N S O I Y → NSOIY? Not valid

Realize there's no common word fitting this. Let me reconsider placements.

Alternative: Maybe I is in position 5 and S is in position 2: N S O _ I
Looking for valid words: N S O K I → NSOKI is not valid. N S O M I → NSOMI is not valid.

Wait, let's think of words with N, O, I, S and one new letter, with O in 3 and N in 1:
Possible structure: N _ O _ I with S in position 2 or 4, but position 4 is open.

Valid word: N I O S _ → invalid S in 4
N S O I _ → S in 2, I in 5, position 4 needs a letter. From remaining: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y

Looking up valid words: The only valid word seems to be N S O I D (but not found), or perhaps N S O I K (not found).

Realize the correct word must be N S O I D is invalid. Let me check N S O I G → NSOIG is invalid.

Wait, let's try N I O S K → but position 1 must be N, position 3 O.

Realize the correct structure is N _ O _ I with S in 2: N S O _ I
The valid word here is N S O K I → NSOKI is not valid. N S O M I → NSOMI is not valid.

Realize I must be in position 5 and S in position 2: N S O _ I
The valid word here is N S O K I → NSOKI is not valid. N S O M I → NSOMI is not valid.

Realize we might have missed: N S O P I → NSOPI is not valid.

After checking, the only valid word fitting N _ O _ I with S in 2 and new letter in 4 is N S O I D (invalid), so likely the word is N S O I K (invalid).

Realize the correct word must be N S O I D is invalid. Let me check N S O I G → NSOIG is invalid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is NOT in the 4th position.

We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.  
We also know N is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Good letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong next guess should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 4).
2. Use other common letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – N is in position 4 again, so skip.
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – N in position 4 again, skip.
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – C is out, skip.
- NINNY – repeats N, not ideal.
- BLUNT (B, L, U, N, T) – N in position 4, skip.
- SLUMP – no N.
- STUMP – no N.
- STONY – already skipped.

Let’s pick a word where N is NOT in position 4.  
“SLUMP” doesn’t contain N.  
“BLUNT” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“STONY” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“SOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  
“TONIC” has C – bad.  
“MOUND” has N in position 4 – bad.  

Another candidate: “BLOND” – N in position 4, skip.  
“SNOUT” – N in position 2, which is allowed.  
Letters: S, N, O, U, T – none of C, R, A, E.  
N is in position 2, which is fine.

So “SNOUT” seems good.

Alternatively, “SLUNG” – N in position 3, letters S, L, U, N, G.  
Also good.

Between SNOUT and SLUNG, SNOUT covers more common letters (S, N, O, U, T).

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters confirmed IN the word: N, O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- N is not in position 2 (from SNOUT) and not in position 4 (from CRANE)  
- O is now confirmed in position 3 (from SNOUT)  

So the pattern so far looks like: _ _ O _ _

Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out and O is fixed)

We still need to place N somewhere. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 3 is already O, so N must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
From SNOUT we saw N in position 2 is bad (it was marked “-”), so N must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s build candidate words:
- If N is in position 1: N _ O _ _
- If N is in position 5: _ _ O _ N

We also want to test the vowel I (only remaining vowel not yet used).

Try N _ O _ _ first:
N I O _ _ → NIOSC, NIOBE, NIONS (but NIONS repeats N).  
N I O D _ → NIOD_ not valid.  
N I O B_ → NIOBE (valid word).  
N I O G_ → NIOG_ not valid.  
N I O L_ → NIOLE? Not valid.  
N I O M_ → NIONM? Not valid.  
N I O S_ → NIOS_ not valid.  

Try _ _ O _ N:
- B I O L N – not a word.  
- D I O L N – not a word.  
- F I O L N – not a word.  
- H I O L N – not a word.  
- L I O N _ – LION_ but we need 5 letters ending N.  
- S I O N _ – SI O N _ → SI O N T is 4 letters.  
- S I O N E – but E is out.  
- S I O N S – S is already tested in SNOUT and was “-”, so S is in word but not position 1.  
- S I O N T – T is out.  

Another angle: use common 5-letter words with O in 3rd and N in 1st or 5th, avoiding banned letters.

Valid candidates:
- N I O B E – but E is out.  
- N I O B I – NIOBI? Not valid.  
- N I O N _ – NIONS? Repeats N.  
- N I O S T – NI O S T? Not valid.  
- N I O D E – E out.  

Back to _ _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- B I O N D – B I O N D → BIOND? Not common.  
- P I O N E – E out.  
- D I O N N – not valid.  
- G I O N T – T out.  

Realize we missed: N I O B E is invalid (E).  
Valid word: N I O N A – but A is out.  
Valid word: N I O S H – NIOSH (valid, but uncommon).  

Better: S _ O _ N pattern.  
S is in word but not position 1 (from SNOUT), so S could be 2, 4, or 5.  
But 5 is N, so S could be 2 or 4.

Try S _ O _ N:
- S I O N E – E out.  
- S I O N T – T out.  
- S L O P N – not valid.  
- S P O K N – SP O K N → SP O K N is 5 letters: S P O K N.  
  Check: S (allowed), P (new), O (fixed), K (new), N (fixed).  
  SP O K N is a valid English word.

This uses new letters P and K, keeps O in 3 and N in 5, and S is in 1 (but we know S is in word but not position 1 – so SP O K N would place S in 1, which contradicts SNOUT feedback that S was “-” (in word but not position 1).  
Thus S cannot be in position 1.  

Next: _ S O _ N:
- B S O N E – E out.  
- D S O N E – E out.  
- F S O N E – E out.  
- H S O N E – E out.  
- L S O N E – E out.  
- M S O N E – E out.  
- P S O N E – E out.  
- V S O N E – E out.  
- W S O N E – E out.  

Try _ _ O S N:
- B L O S N – not valid.  
- D L O S N – not valid.  
- F L O S N – not valid.  
- H L O S N – not valid.  
- M L O S N – not valid.  

Try N _ O S _:
- N I O S H – valid, but uncommon.  
- N I O S E – E out.  

Try N _ O _ S:
- N I O B S – not valid.  
- N I O D S – not valid.  

Realize better candidate: B L O W N – but W is new, O in 3, N in 5, and B, L are new.  
Check letters: B, L, O, W, N – none are banned.  
B L O W N is a valid English word, fits _ _ O _ N pattern, and uses new letters B, L, W.

This seems optimal.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x):
C, R, A, E, U, T, B, L, W

Letters confirmed IN the word:
N  (must appear, but positions 2, 4 ruled out, so N in 1 or 5)
O  (fixed in position 3)

Current pattern: _ _ O _ _

Remaining consonants to test: D, F, G, H, M, P, V, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I (only one left)

N must be in position 1 or 5.

Case 1: N _ O _ _
   - N I O _ _  → NIONS (invalid, repeats N) or NIOBE (but E is out)
   - N I O D _ → NIOD_ not valid
   - N I O G_ → NIOG_ not valid
   - N I O M_ → NIONM? Not valid

   - N I O H_ → NIOHA? Not valid
   - N I O V_ → NIOVA? Not valid
   - N I O Y_ → NIOYA? Not valid

Case 2: _ _ O _ N
   - H I O N D → HI O N D (valid word: HIOND? No)
   - D I O N G → DIONG? No
   - F I O N D → FI O N D (valid word: FI O N D → FI O N D is 5 letters, but not common)
   - G I O N T → T is out
   - M I O N A → A is out
   - P I O N E → E is out
   - V I O N D → VIOND? No
   - H I O N E → E is out
   - D I O N N → N is already last
   - S I O N E → E is out
   - S P I O N → O is not 3rd
   - S K I O N → K is new, S is in word but not position 1
   - S K I O N → SKION? Not valid
   - S K I O N → SKION is not a word
   - S H I O N → SHION? Not valid
   - S M I O N → SMION? Not valid
   - S P I O N → SPION? Not valid
   - S P I O N → SPION is not a word

Realize we missed: D I O N N is not valid, but D I O N E is invalid (E out).

Valid word: D I O N I → DIONI? Not valid.

Another approach: use common 5-letter words with O in 3rd and N in 5th, avoiding banned letters.

Valid candidates:
- S P I O N → SPION? Not valid
- S K I O N → SKION? Not valid
- F I O N D → FI O N D is 5 letters, but not a common word
- G I O N T → T is out
- M I O N D → MI O N D is not valid
- P I O N E → E is out
- V I O N D → VIOND is not valid
- H I O N D → HIOND is not valid

Realize the only valid word fitting _ _ O _ N is FI O N D (but it's not a common word) or D I O N E (invalid E).

Re-examine Case 1: N _ O _ _
   - N I O S H → NIOSH is valid (NIOSH is a word: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health)

NIOSH uses:
- N in 1st (allowed)
- I in 2nd
- O in 3rd (fixed)
- S in 4th (S was ""-"" in SNOUT, meaning S is in word but not position 1 - position 4 is new)
- H in 5th (new letter)

This seems valid.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x):
C, R, A, E, U, T, B, L, W, H

Letters confirmed IN the word:
N  (✓ in position 1 from NIOSH)
O  (✓ in position 3 from all guesses)
I  (in word but not position 2 from NIOSH)
S  (in word but not position 4 from NIOSH)

So the pattern is:
N _ O _ _

Positions left to fill: 2 and 4.

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y, plus S and I must appear somewhere.

But:
- I cannot be in position 2 (from NIOSH feedback I(-)).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from NIOSH feedback S(-)).

Therefore:
- I must be in position 4 (only remaining spot for I).
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot for S).

Hence the word must be:
N S O I _

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word matching N S O I _.

The only common English word that fits is N S O I D → N S O I D = N S O I D.

Let’s verify:
- N in 1st ✓ (from NIOSH)
- S in 2nd (new position, allowed)
- O in 3rd ✓
- I in 4th (new position, allowed)
- D is a new letter, not yet tested.

So the guess is N S O I D.
