### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains the five most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives me the best chance to get hits on multiple letters right away.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters absent: A, R, E
   - Letters present: O, S
   - O not in position 3
   - S not in position 4

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - Letters absent: U, D
   - Letters present: S, O, N
   - S not in position 1
   - O not in position 2
   - N not in position 4

So far we know:
- Present letters: O, S, N
- Absent letters: A, R, E, U, D
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- N cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, N exactly once each
- Avoids positions 2,3 for O; 1,4 for S; 4 for N
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A,R,E,U,D)

Possible positions for each known letter:
- O: positions 1, 4, 5 (but 4 is free, 5 is free)
- S: positions 2, 3, 5
- N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5

Let’s list candidate words meeting these constraints and containing only allowed letters (no A,R,E,U,D). We can try:

- SN: must fit into 5 letters, so need 2 more letters from remaining alphabet (avoiding the banned ones).
- Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next word would introduce new common letters to narrow things down. “SNOWY” uses W and Y, but Y is less common. “SONIC” uses I and C. Let’s pick “SONIC” because C and I are common and fit the constraints.

Check constraints for SONIC:
- S in position 1 → but feedback said S not in position 1 (from SOUND feedback). So S cannot be first. SONIC is invalid.

Next candidate: “SNOWY” – again S in position 1 is invalid.

Next: “COINS” – uses C, I, N, O, S. Check positions:
- C: new letter
- O: position 2 → but O cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND feedback). Invalid.

Next: “CONIS” – same issue, O in position 2.

Next: “SCION” – uses S, C, I, O, N. Check positions:
- S: position 1 → invalid (cannot be first).

Next: “CIONS” – invalid word.

Next: “PONDS” – D is banned.

Next: “SNORT” – R is banned.

Next: “STONY” – Y is allowed, but S in position 1 is invalid.

Next: “TONIC” – uses T, O, N, I, C. Check positions:
- O: position 2 → invalid (cannot be second).

Next: “TONYS” – Y and S allowed, but O in position 2 invalid.

Next: “SNIPS” – S appears twice, and S cannot be in positions 1 or 4. Still, double S might be allowed, but we don’t know yet if S appears twice. Better to avoid for now.

Next: “STOCK” – C, K, T allowed, but O in position 2 invalid.

Next: “STING” – O not present, so invalid.

Next: “STOCK” already checked.

Next: “STOCK” again.

Next: “STOCK” again.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions for O, S, N.

We have three known letters: O, S, N must appear once each.

Positions:
1 2 3 4 5
- O cannot be 2 or 3 → possible 1,4,5
- S cannot be 1 or 4 → possible 2,3,5
- N cannot be 4 → possible 1,2,3,5

We need to assign O, S, N to three distinct positions from above, and fill the other two slots with new allowed letters (from B,C,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Let’s enumerate possible valid assignments:

Case 1: O in position 1
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 2,3,5 (but not same as S).
Subcases:
- S=2, N=3 or 5 → but N cannot be 4 (already), so N=3 or 5
   - S=2, N=3 → word: O S N _ _ → need two more letters. Possible: OSN _ _ → but need valid word. ""OSN"" is not a start. Maybe ""OSN"" + ""IX"" → ""OSNIX"" – invalid.
   - S=2, N=5 → O S _ _ N → need letters 3,4 from allowed set. Possible: O S B C → ""OSBCN"" – invalid. Need valid word. ""OSYNC"" – but C is allowed, but ""OSYNC"" is not a common word. ""OSN"" + ""CK"" → ""OSNCK"" – invalid.
   - S=3, N=2 or 5
      - S=3, N=2 → O N S _ _ → need 4,5. Possible: ""ONSET"" – but E is banned. ""ONSET"" has E – invalid. ""ONSKY"" – but Y is allowed, ""ONSKY"" is not a word.
      - S=3, N=5 → O _ S _ N → need 2,4. Possible: ""O B S I N"" – ""OBSIN"" – invalid. ""O C S I N"" – ""OCSIN"" – invalid.
   - S=5, N=2 or 3
      - S=5, N=2 → O N _ _ S → need 3,4. Possible: ""ONICS"" – but I is allowed, C is allowed. ""ONICS"" – valid? Not common.
      - S=5, N=3 → O _ N _ S → need 2,4. Possible: ""O C N I S"" – ""OCNIS"" – invalid.

Case 2: O in position 4
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
Subcases:
- S=2, N=1,3,5
   - S=2, N=1 → N O S _ _ → need 3,5. Possible: ""NOSIC"" – valid? Not sure. ""NOSIC"" – no.
   - S=2, N=3 → _ O S _ N → but O is 4, so positions are 1 2 3 4 5
      - O is 4, so this would be _ _ S O N – but N is 5. So word: _ _ S O N → but N cannot be 5? No, N can be 5. So _ _ S O N. Need 1,2. Possible: ""C I S O N"" – ""CISON"" – invalid. ""B I S O N"" – ""BISON"" – valid word! And uses allowed letters (B,I,S,O,N). Check constraints:
         - S is position 3 → allowed (S can be 2,3,5)
         - O is position 4 → allowed (O can be 1,4,5)
         - N is position 5 → allowed (N can be 1,2,3,5)
         - Letters used: B,I,S,O,N – none are banned (A,R,E,U,D). This seems valid.
      - ""BISON"" is a valid 5-letter word.
- S=2, N=5 → _ O S _ N → need 1,3. Possible: ""C O S I N"" – ""COSIN"" – invalid. ""B O S I N"" – ""BOSIN"" – invalid.

Case 3: O in position 5
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 1,2,3,5 (but 5 is taken by O), so N=1,2,3
Subcases:
- S=2, N=1,3
   - S=2, N=1 → N _ S _ O → need 3,4. Possible: ""N I S C O"" – ""NISCO"" – invalid.
   - S=2, N=3 → _ S N _ O → need 1,4. Possible: ""C S N I O"" – ""CSNIO"" – invalid.
- S=3, N=1,2
   - S=3, N=1 → N _ _ S O → need 2,3. Possible: ""N I C S O"" – ""NICSO"" – invalid.
   - S=3, N=2 → _ N S _ O → need 1,4. Possible: ""C N S I O"" – ""CNSIO"" – invalid.
- S=5, N=1,2,3
   - S=5, N=1 → N _ _ _ S → need 2,3,4. Possible: ""N I C K S"" – ""NICKS"" – valid word! Check constraints:
         - N is position 1 → allowed (N can be 1,2,3,5)
         - I, C, K are new allowed letters
         - S is position 5 → allowed (S can be 2,3,5)
         - O is position 5 → but S is also position 5 – cannot have two letters in same position. Invalid because O must be in position 5 and S must be in position 5 – impossible. So ""NICKS"" is invalid because it doesn’t contain O.

From above, the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is ""BISON"" (from Case 2, O in 4, S in 3, N in 5).

Therefore, the next guess is BISON.

Next: “SNIPS” – S appears twice, and S cannot be in positions 1 or 4. Still, double S might be allowed, but we don’t know yet if S appears twice. Better to avoid for now.

Next: “STOCK” – C, K, T allowed, but O in position 2 invalid.

Next: “STING” – O not present, so invalid.

Next: “STOCK” already checked.

Next: “STOCK” again.

Next: “STOCK” again.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions for O, S, N.

We have three known letters: O, S, N must appear once each.

Positions:
1 2 3 4 5
- O cannot be 2 or 3 → possible 1,4,5
- S cannot be 1 or 4 → possible 2,3,5
- N cannot be 4 → possible 1,2,3,5

We need to assign O, S, N to three distinct positions from above, and fill the other two slots with new allowed letters (from B,C,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Let’s enumerate possible valid assignments:

Case 1: O in position 1
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 2,3,5 (but not same as S).
Subcases:
- S=2, N=3 or 5 → but N cannot be 4 (already), so N=3 or 5
   - S=2, N=3 → word: O S N _ _ → need two more letters. Possible: OSN _ _ → but need valid word. ""OSN"" is not a start. Maybe ""OSN"" + ""IX"" → ""OSNIX"" – invalid.
   - S=2, N=5 → O S _ _ N → need letters 3,4 from allowed set. Possible: O S B C → ""OSBCN"" – invalid. Need valid word. ""OSYNC"" – but C is allowed, but ""OSYNC"" is not a common word. ""OSN"" + ""CK"" → ""OSNCK"" – invalid.
   - S=3, N=2 or 5
      - S=3, N=2 → O N S _ _ → need 4,5. Possible: ""ONSET"" – but E is banned. ""ONSET"" has E – invalid. ""ONSKY"" – but Y is allowed, ""ONSKY"" is not a word.
      - S=3, N=5 → O _ S _ N → need 2,4. Possible: ""O B S I N"" – ""OBSIN"" – invalid. ""O C S I N"" – ""OCSIN"" – invalid.
   - S=5, N=2 or 3
      - S=5, N=2 → O N _ _ S → need 3,4. Possible: ""ONICS"" – but I is allowed, C is allowed. ""ONICS"" – valid? Not common.
      - S=5, N=3 → O _ N _ S → need 2,4. Possible: ""O C N I S"" – ""OCNIS"" – invalid.

Case 2: O in position 4
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
Subcases:
- S=2, N=1,3,5
   - S=2, N=1 → N O S _ _ → need 3,5. Possible: ""NOSIC"" – valid? Not sure. ""NOSIC"" – no.
   - S=2, N=3 → _ O S _ N → but O is 4, so positions are 1 2 3 4 5
      - O is 4, so this would be _ _ S O N – but N is 5. So word: _ _ S O N → but N cannot be 5? No, N can be 5. So _ _ S O N. Need 1,2. Possible: ""C I S O N"" – ""CISON"" – invalid. ""B I S O N"" – ""BISON"" – valid word! And uses allowed letters (B,I,S,O,N). Check constraints:
         - S is position 3 → allowed (S can be 2,3,5)
         - O is position 4 → allowed (O can be 1,4,5)
         - N is position 5 → allowed (N can be 1,2,3,5)
         - Letters used: B,I,S,O,N – none are banned (A,R,E,U,D). This seems valid.
      - ""BISON"" is a valid 5-letter word.
- S=2, N=5 → _ O S _ N → need 1,3. Possible: ""C O S I N"" – ""COSIN"" – invalid. ""B O S I N"" – ""BOSIN"" – invalid.

Case 3: O in position 5
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 1,2,3,5 (but 5 is taken by O), so N=1,2,3
Subcases:
- S=2, N=1,3
   - S=2, N=1 → N _ S _ O → need 3,4. Possible: ""N I S C O"" – ""NISCO"" – invalid.
   - S=2, N=3 → _ S N _ O → need 1,4. Possible: ""C S N I O"" – ""CSNIO"" – invalid.
- S=3, N=1,2
   - S=3, N=1 → N _ _ S O → need 2,3. Possible: ""N I C S O"" – ""NICSO"" – invalid.
   - S=3, N=2 → _ N S _ O → need 1,4. Possible: ""C N S I O"" – ""CNSIO"" – invalid.
- S=5, N=1,2,3
   - S=5, N=1 → N _ _ _ S → need 2,3,4. Possible: ""N I C K S"" – ""NICKS"" – valid word! Check constraints:
         - N is position 1 → allowed (N can be 1,2,3,5)
         - I, C, K are new allowed letters
         - S is position 5 → allowed (S can be 2,3,5)
         - O is position 5 → but S is also position 5 – cannot have two letters in same position. Invalid because O must be in position 5 and S must be in position 5 – impossible. So ""NICKS"" is invalid because it doesn’t contain O.

From above, the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is ""BISON"" (from Case 2, O in 4, S in 3, N in 5).

Therefore, the next guess is BISON.",Guess 3: BISON -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) S(-) O(-) N(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains the five most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives me the best chance to get hits on multiple letters right away.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E
- Letters definitely present: O, S
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Next guess should:
1. Include both O and S
2. Place O somewhere other than position 3
3. Place S somewhere other than position 4
4. Avoid A, R, E
5. Introduce new common letters to test

Good candidates: STONE (but E is out), SLOSH, SPOON, SOUND, etc.

""STONE"" is invalid (E is out).
""SLOSH"" uses S, L, O, S, H – but S appears twice, and we don't know if S is allowed twice.
""SPOON"" uses P and N which are common.
""SOUND"" uses U, N, D – all new letters.

""SOUND"" seems best: it has O and S, avoids A/R/E, and tests new letters U, N, D.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters absent: A, R, E
   - Letters present: O, S
   - O not in position 3
   - S not in position 4

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - Letters absent: U, D
   - Letters present: S, O, N
   - S not in position 1
   - O not in position 2
   - N not in position 4

So far we know:
- Present letters: O, S, N
- Absent letters: A, R, E, U, D
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- N cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, N exactly once each
- Avoids positions 2,3 for O; 1,4 for S; 4 for N
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A,R,E,U,D)

Possible positions for each known letter:
- O: positions 1, 4, 5 (but 4 is free, 5 is free)
- S: positions 2, 3, 5
- N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5

Let’s list candidate words meeting these constraints and containing only allowed letters (no A,R,E,U,D). We can try:

- SN: must fit into 5 letters, so need 2 more letters from remaining alphabet (avoiding the banned ones).
- Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next word would introduce new common letters to narrow things down. “SNOWY” uses W and Y, but Y is less common. “SONIC” uses I and C. Let’s pick “SONIC” because C and I are common and fit the constraints.

Check constraints for SONIC:
- S in position 1 → but feedback said S not in position 1 (from SOUND feedback). So S cannot be first. SONIC is invalid.

Next candidate: “SNOWY” – again S in position 1 is invalid.

Next: “COINS” – uses C, I, N, O, S. Check positions:
- C: new letter
- O: position 2 → but O cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND feedback). Invalid.

Next: “CONIS” – same issue, O in position 2.

Next: “SCION” – uses S, C, I, O, N. Check positions:
- S: position 1 → invalid (cannot be first).

Next: “CIONS” – invalid word.

Next: “PONDS” – D is banned.

Next: “SNORT” – R is banned.

Next: “STONY” – Y is allowed, but S in position 1 is invalid.

Next: “TONIC” – uses T, O, N, I, C. Check positions:
- O: position 2 → invalid (cannot be second).

Next: “TONYS” – Y and S allowed, but O in position 2 invalid.

Next: “SNIPS” – S appears twice, and S cannot be in positions 1 or 4. Still, double S might be allowed, but we don’t know yet if S appears twice. Better to avoid for now.

Next: “STOCK” – C, K, T allowed, but O in position 2 invalid.

Next: “STING” – O not present, so invalid.

Next: “STOCK” already checked.

Next: “STOCK” again.

Next: “STOCK” again.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions for O, S, N.

We have three known letters: O, S, N must appear once each.

Positions:
1 2 3 4 5
- O cannot be 2 or 3 → possible 1,4,5
- S cannot be 1 or 4 → possible 2,3,5
- N cannot be 4 → possible 1,2,3,5

We need to assign O, S, N to three distinct positions from above, and fill the other two slots with new allowed letters (from B,C,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Let’s enumerate possible valid assignments:

Case 1: O in position 1
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 2,3,5 (but not same as S).
Subcases:
- S=2, N=3 or 5 → but N cannot be 4 (already), so N=3 or 5
   - S=2, N=3 → word: O S N _ _ → need two more letters. Possible: OSN _ _ → but need valid word. ""OSN"" is not a start. Maybe ""OSN"" + ""IX"" → ""OSNIX"" – invalid.
   - S=2, N=5 → O S _ _ N → need letters 3,4 from allowed set. Possible: O S B C → ""OSBCN"" – invalid. Need valid word. ""OSYNC"" – but C is allowed, but ""OSYNC"" is not a common word. ""OSN"" + ""CK"" → ""OSNCK"" – invalid.
   - S=3, N=2 or 5
      - S=3, N=2 → O N S _ _ → need 4,5. Possible: ""ONSET"" – but E is banned. ""ONSET"" has E – invalid. ""ONSKY"" – but Y is allowed, ""ONSKY"" is not a word.
      - S=3, N=5 → O _ S _ N → need 2,4. Possible: ""O B S I N"" – ""OBSIN"" – invalid. ""O C S I N"" – ""OCSIN"" – invalid.
   - S=5, N=2 or 3
      - S=5, N=2 → O N _ _ S → need 3,4. Possible: ""ONICS"" – but I is allowed, C is allowed. ""ONICS"" – valid? Not common.
      - S=5, N=3 → O _ N _ S → need 2,4. Possible: ""O C N I S"" – ""OCNIS"" – invalid.

Case 2: O in position 4
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
Subcases:
- S=2, N=1,3,5
   - S=2, N=1 → N O S _ _ → need 3,5. Possible: ""NOSIC"" – valid? Not sure. ""NOSIC"" – no.
   - S=2, N=3 → _ O S _ N → but O is 4, so positions are 1 2 3 4 5
      - O is 4, so this would be _ _ S O N – but N is 5. So word: _ _ S O N → but N cannot be 5? No, N can be 5. So _ _ S O N. Need 1,2. Possible: ""C I S O N"" – ""CISON"" – invalid. ""B I S O N"" – ""BISON"" – valid word! And uses allowed letters (B,I,S,O,N). Check constraints:
         - S is position 3 → allowed (S can be 2,3,5)
         - O is position 4 → allowed (O can be 1,4,5)
         - N is position 5 → allowed (N can be 1,2,3,5)
         - Letters used: B,I,S,O,N – none are banned (A,R,E,U,D). This seems valid.
      - ""BISON"" is a valid 5-letter word.
- S=2, N=5 → _ O S _ N → need 1,3. Possible: ""C O S I N"" – ""COSIN"" – invalid. ""B O S I N"" – ""BOSIN"" – invalid.

Case 3: O in position 5
Then S can be 2,3,5 and N can be 1,2,3,5 (but 5 is taken by O), so N=1,2,3
Subcases:
- S=2, N=1,3
   - S=2, N=1 → N _ S _ O → need 3,4. Possible: ""N I S C O"" – ""NISCO"" – invalid.
   - S=2, N=3 → _ S N _ O → need 1,4. Possible: ""C S N I O"" – ""CSNIO"" – invalid.
- S=3, N=1,2
   - S=3, N=1 → N _ _ S O → need 2,3. Possible: ""N I C S O"" – ""NICSO"" – invalid.
   - S=3, N=2 → _ N S _ O → need 1,4. Possible: ""C N S I O"" – ""CNSIO"" – invalid.
- S=5, N=1,2,3
   - S=5, N=1 → N _ _ _ S → need 2,3,4. Possible: ""N I C K S"" – ""NICKS"" – valid word! Check constraints:
         - N is position 1 → allowed (N can be 1,2,3,5)
         - I, C, K are new allowed letters
         - S is position 5 → allowed (S can be 2,3,5)
         - O is position 5 → but S is also position 5 – cannot have two letters in same position. Invalid because O must be in position 5 and S must be in position 5 – impossible. So ""NICKS"" is invalid because it doesn’t contain O.

From above, the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is ""BISON"" (from Case 2, O in 4, S in 3, N in 5).

Therefore, the next guess is BISON.

Let's digest the new feedback:

BISON → B(x) I(✓) S(-) O(-) N(-)

- B is not in the word.
- I is in the word and in the correct position 2.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

Known facts so far:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- I (fixed at position 2)
- S (somewhere other than 3)
- O (somewhere other than 4)
- N (somewhere other than 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, E, U, D, B

Positions ruled out:
- S ≠ 3, 1 (from SOUND and BISON)
- O ≠ 2, 3, 4 (from SOUND and BISON)
- N ≠ 4, 5 (from SOUND and BISON)

So the possible positions now:
- Position 1: can be S, O, N (but S cannot be 1, from SOUND feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1). Wait, SOUND feedback said S(-) which means S is in the word but NOT in position 1. So S cannot be 1 or 3 or 4 (from BISON, S was in 3 and marked -, so 3 is wrong; from SOUND, 1 is wrong). Actually, let's re-examine:

From SOUND: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1.
From BISON: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.
So S must be in position 2, 4, or 5. But position 2 is I, so S must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly:
O: from SOUND O(-) means O is not in position 2; from BISON O(-) means O is not in position 4. So O must be in 1, 3, or 5.
But from AROSE, O(-) means O is not in position 3. So O must be in 1 or 5.

N: from SOUND N(-) means N is not in position 4; from BISON N(-) means N is not in position 5. So N must be in 1, 2, or 3. But position 2 is I, so N must be in 1 or 3.

So we have:
- Position 1: O or N
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: N or O (but O cannot be here because from AROSE O(-) means O is not in 3)
Wait, from AROSE, O(-) means O is not in position 3. So O must be in 1 or 5.
Thus:
- Position 1: N (since O cannot be here if O must be 1 or 5)
- Position 5: O (since O must be 1 or 5, and 1 is taken by N)

Wait, let's re-express:

Possible positions:
O must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4)
N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)

So:
- If O is in 1, then N must be in 3.
- If O is in 5, then N must be in 1.

Thus two possibilities:
1. O _ I N _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5)
   Then position 4 must be filled by S (since S must be 4 or 5, and 5 is O)
2. N _ I _ O
   Then position 4 must be filled by S (since S must be 4 or 5, and 5 is O)

So the two candidate patterns:
1. O I N S O – but this has O twice and S once, but we don't know if O appears twice.
2. N I _ S O – position 3 must be a letter not yet used, not banned.

Looking at the letters used so far:
Known letters in word: I, S, O, N
Known letters not in word: A, R, E, U, D, B
Remaining possible letters (from alphabet excluding banned): C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

For pattern N I _ S O:
Position 3 must be one of these remaining letters. Let's pick common ones:
Possible words: N I C S O – ""NICSO"" – invalid
N I K S O – ""NIKSO"" – invalid
N I L S O – ""NILSO"" – invalid
N I T S O – ""NITSO"" – invalid
N I M S O – ""NIMSO"" – invalid

N I P S O – ""NIPSO"" – invalid
N I H S O – ""NIHSO"" – invalid
N I V S O – ""NIVSO"" – invalid
N I L S O – ""NILSO"" – invalid
N I L S O – seems none are valid.

Wait, let's check pattern O I N S _:
Then position 5 must be filled. From remaining letters:
O I N S C – ""OINSC"" – invalid
O I N S T – ""OINST"" – invalid
O I N S K – ""OINSK"" – invalid

O I N S W – ""OINSW"" – invalid
O I N S Y – ""OINSY"" – invalid
O I N S Z – ""OINSZ"" – invalid

Hmm, none of these seem like valid English words. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Alternative approach: maybe O appears only once, and we have to fit S, O, N plus one more letter.

Let's re-examine the patterns with valid English words in mind.

We have:
- I is fixed at position 2
- S must be in 4 or 5
- O must be in 1 or 5
- N must be in 1 or 3

Case 1: O in 1, N in 3
Then word is O I N S _ (position 5 unknown)
But S must be in 4 or 5. Here S is in 4, so position 5 must be another letter.
But O I N S _ – valid word? ""OIN"" is not a start.

Case 2: O in 5, N in 1
Then word is N I _ S O (position 3 unknown)
Looking for valid 5-letter words: N I _ S O
Possible: N I V S O – ""NIVSO"" – invalid
N I K S O – ""NIKSO"" – invalid
N I C S O – ""NICSO"" – invalid
N I M S O – ""NIMSO"" – invalid
N I L S O – ""NILSO"" – invalid
N I T S O – ""NITSO"" – invalid
N I P S O – ""NIPSO"" – invalid
N I H S O – ""NIHSO"" – invalid
N I G S O – ""NIGSO"" – invalid
N I D S O – but D is banned
N I B S O – B is banned
N I A S O – A is banned
N I E S O – E is banned
N I U S O – U is banned
N I R S O – R is banned
N I S S O – S appears twice, possible but unlikely
N I F S O – ""NIFSO"" – invalid
N I J S O – ""NIJSO"" – invalid
N I L S O – ""NILSO"" – invalid
N I V S O – ""NIVSO"" – invalid
N I W S O – ""NIWSO"" – invalid
N I Y S O – ""NIYSO"" – invalid
N I Z S O – ""NI ZSO"" – invalid

None seem valid. Maybe O appears twice? But that's unlikely.

Alternative: maybe I is in position 2, and we have S, O, N plus one more letter.

Looking at valid English words with I in position 2:
Possible words: ""S I N O _"" – but S must be 4 or 5
Wait, let's think differently.

Let's list possible positions:
I is at 2
S must be at 4 or 5
O must be at 1 or 5
N must be at 1 or 3

Let's try:
- If S is at 4, then O must be at 5 (since O can't be at 1 if N must be at 1 or 3)
   Then word is _ I N S O
   Looking for _ I N S O: ""C I N S O"" – ""CINSO"" – invalid
   ""M I N S O"" – ""MINSO"" – invalid
   ""T I N S O"" – ""TINSO"" – invalid

   ""Y I N S O"" – ""YIN SO"" – invalid
   ""Z I N S O"" – ""ZIN SO"" – invalid
   ""F I N S O"" – ""FIN SO"" – invalid

None seem valid.

Alternative: S at 5, then O must be at 1 (since O can't be at 5 if S is at 5)
Then word is O I _ _ S
N must be at 1 or 3. 1 is O, so N at 3
Then word is O I N _ S
Need position 4: valid letters remaining: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible words: O I N C S – ""OINCS"" – invalid
O I N K S – ""OINKS"" – valid word!
O I N C S – ""OINCS"" – invalid
O I N G S – ""OINGS"" – invalid
O I N T S – ""OINTS"" – valid word (archaic but listed)
O I N K S – ""OINKS"" – seems most plausible.

Check constraints:
- O is at 1: allowed (O can be 1 or 5)
- I is at 2: correct
- N is at 3: allowed (N can be 1 or 3)
- S is at 5: allowed (S can be 4 or 5)
- Letters used: O, I, N, K, S – none banned.

Thus, ""OINKS"" is a valid next guess.
