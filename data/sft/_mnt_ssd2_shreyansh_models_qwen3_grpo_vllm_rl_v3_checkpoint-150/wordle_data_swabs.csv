### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

3. Try new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “SLANT”:
- Uses S (known to be in word) and A (known to be in word).
- Introduces L, N, T (common consonants) and keeps the vowel A.
- Places S in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position is okay).
- Places A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so new position is okay).
- Avoids R, O, E entirely.

This should help confirm or rule out L, N, T and give better placement for A and S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E
- A and S are not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.

To make the second guess, I want to:
1. Keep A and S (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Try new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “SLANT”:
- Uses S (known to be in word) and A (known to be in word).
- Introduces L, N, T (common consonants) and keeps the vowel A.
- Places S in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position is okay).
- Places A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so new position is okay).
- Avoids R, O, E entirely.

This should help confirm or rule out L, N, T and give better placement for A and S.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.

So we now know:

To make the second guess, I want to:
1. Keep A and S (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Try new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “SLANT”:
- Uses S (known to be in word) and A (known to be in word).
- Introduces L, N, T (common consonants) and keeps the vowel A.
- Places S in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position is okay).
- Places A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so new position is okay).
- Avoids R, O, E entirely.

This should help confirm or rule out L, N, T and give better placement for A and S.

Best seems SWAMP:

- Uses W, M, P (all allowed)
- Keeps S and A in correct positions
- No disallowed letters

Current confirmed information:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: W ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)
- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, L, N, T, M, P.

So far we have:
S W A _ _

Remaining possible consonants (not ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, V, Y, etc.
Remaining possible vowels (not ruled out): I, U (A is already placed).

We need two more letters to fill positions 4 and 5, using only allowed letters.

Possible endings:
- SWAID (valid word, uses I, D)
- SWAIN (N is ruled out)
- SWAGS (G, S - but S is already used in position 1)
- SWASH (H - but S is already used)
- SWAIF (F - but ""SWAIF"" is not a common word)
- SWAID seems the best option here.

""SWAID"" is a valid word meaning to dress or adorn, and it uses allowed letters I and D.

We now know:

1. Exact matches:
   - Position 1: S ✓
   - Position 2: W ✓
   - Position 3: A ✓

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all feedback):
   R, O, E, L, N, T, M, P, I, D

So the pattern is S W A _ _ and the remaining letters must come from:
   Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, V, Y
   Vowels: U (A and I are placed; E, O ruled out)

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, using only the allowed set.

Possible combinations:
   - SWA + B + Y → SWABY (not a word)
   - SWA + B + K → SWABK (invalid)
   - SWA + C + H → SWACH (invalid)
   - SWA + C + Y → SWACY (invalid)
   - SWA + F + Y → SWAFY (invalid)
   - SWA + G + Y → SWAGY (valid word)
   - SWA + H + K → SWAHK (invalid)
   - SWA + K + Y → SWAKY (invalid)
   - SWA + V + Y → SWAVY (invalid)
   - SWA + Y + K → SWA YK (invalid)

The only valid word fitting the pattern S W A _ _ with allowed letters is SWAGY.

SWAGY means ""marked by swagger"" or ""showing bravado"" and is a recognized 5-letter word.

Current confirmed information:
- Exact matches: S W A _ _
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, L, N, T, M, P, I, D, G, Y

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, H, K, V
Remaining vowels: U (A and I are placed; E, O ruled out)

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining pool.  
The only vowel left is U, and the consonants left are B, C, F, H, K, V.

Possible combinations:
- SWA + U + B → SWaub (invalid)
- SWA + U + C → SWauc (invalid)
- SWA + U + F → SWauf (invalid)
- SWA + U + H → SWauh (invalid)
- SWA + U + K → SWauk (invalid)
- SWA + U + V → SWa uv (invalid)

Looking at valid English words:
- SWABU (not a word)
- SWACU (not a word)
- SWAFU (not a word)
- SWAHU (not a word)
- SWAKU (not a word)
- SWAVU (not a word)

Wait—let’s list real 5-letter words that start SWA and use only allowed letters:
- SWABS (B, S—but S already used in position 1)
- SWACK (C, K—both allowed)
- SWAFF (F, F—both allowed)
- SWAKS (K, S—but S already used)
- SWALM (L, M—both ruled out)
- SWASH (S, H—S already used)
- SWATS (T, S—T ruled out)
- SWAZZ (Z not in remaining pool)

From the remaining valid options, SWACK and SWAFF are both real words.  
SWAFF means “a bunch of rough, unpolished people” and uses F twice.  
SWACK means “to rough up” and uses C and K.

Both fit, but SWAFF uses only allowed letters (F, F) and is a valid word.

Therefore, the best next guess is SWAFF.
