For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. These letters are among the most frequent in English, so this should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" because it also covers common letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter coverage.

This should help us quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A.
- N is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has N and E somewhere.
- Avoids C, R, A.
- N not in position 4, E not in position 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N and E).

Good next guesses should test new common letters while placing N and E in different positions. Let's try:
- ""STONE"" – but this has S,T,O,N,E. O is common, but we might want to test more letters.
- ""UNTIE"" – but this has U,N,T,I,E. U is less common.
- ""ENEMY"" – but this has E,N,E,M,Y. Repeats E, which isn't ideal.

""STONE"" seems good because it tests S, T, O, N, E. N is in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so this would conflict. Let's avoid N in position 4.

""UNTIE"" has N in position 2, which is fine. But U is less common.

""ENEMY"" has N in position 2, E in position 1 and 3. This might be too many Es.

""ELBOW"" – but this has L,B,O,W. Let's see: E,L,B,O,W. N is missing, which we know is in the word.

""ENDUE"" – E,N,D,U,E. N in position 2, E in 1 and 5. But E is not supposed to be in position 5. So this is invalid.

""NEVER"" – N,E,V,E,R. R is excluded, so no.

""NEWEL"" – N,E,W,E,L. E in 5 is excluded.

So far we know:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, I, G, H.
- Positions ruled out:
  – N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

That leaves positions 3 and 4 for E, or E could also be in position 1, but position 1 is already N, so E must be in 3 or 4.

Letters still available (besides N and E): B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- N U M E R – but R is excluded.
- N U D E S – S is allowed, but is this a common word? Yes, ""NUDES"" is valid.
- N U D E D – but double D is fine, and D is allowed.
- N U M E D – but M is allowed.
- N O V E L – O, V, L allowed.
- N O T E D – O, T, D allowed.
- N O S E D – O, S, D allowed.
- N O V E L – already considered.
- N U D E S – seems good, tests U, D, S.
- N O S E T – but T is allowed, and ""NOSET"" isn't a word.
- N O S E D – ""NOSED"" is valid.

""N U D E S"" and ""N O S E D"" both fit. ""NUDES"" tests U and D, while ""NOSED"" tests O and S. Between these, ""NUDES"" introduces two new letters (U, D, S) in one go, giving more information.

But wait, ""NUDES"" has E in position 4, which is allowed (E not in 2 or 5). Let’s verify:
N (✓), U, D, E (allowed in 4), S. No excluded letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. These letters are among the most frequent in English, so this should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" because it also covers common letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter coverage.

This should help us quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A.
- N is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has N and E somewhere.
- Avoids C, R, A.
- N not in position 4, E not in position 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N and E).

Good next guesses should test new common letters while placing N and E in different positions. Let's try:
- ""STONE"" – but this has S,T,O,N,E. O is common, but we might want to test more letters.
- ""UNTIE"" – but this has U,N,T,I,E. U is less common.
- ""ENEMY"" – but this has E,N,E,M,Y. Repeats E, which isn't ideal.

""STONE"" seems good because it tests S, T, O, N, E. N is in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so this would conflict. Let's avoid N in position 4.

""UNTIE"" has N in position 2, which is fine. But U is less common.

""ENEMY"" has N in position 2, E in position 1 and 3. This might be too many Es.

""ELBOW"" – but this has L,B,O,W. Let's see: E,L,B,O,W. N is missing, which we know is in the word.

""ENDUE"" – E,N,D,U,E. N in position 2, E in 1 and 5. But E is not supposed to be in position 5. So this is invalid.

""NEVER"" – N,E,V,E,R. R is excluded, so no.

""NEWEL"" – N,E,W,E,L. E in 5 is excluded.

""NEIGH"" – N,E,I,G,H. E in 2, N in 1. This seems valid. Tests N,E,I,G,H. No C,R,A. N not in 4, E not in 5. This looks good.

""NEIGH"" is a valid 5-letter word, uses N and E in new positions, and tests new common letters I, G, H.

  – N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

That leaves positions 3 and 4 for E, or E could also be in position 1, but position 1 is already N, so E must be in 3 or 4.

Letters still available (besides N and E): B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with N, containing E in position 3 or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with N, has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and uses only the allowed letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible patterns:
N _ _ E S

Let’s list valid English words fitting this pattern:
- N O V E S (NOVES – not a common word)
- N O T E S (NOTES – valid)
- N O V E S (already considered)
- N O S E S (NOSES – valid)
- N O V E S (already considered)
- N O T E S (already considered)
- N O S E S (NOSES – uses O, S, E, S – but S is already fixed at 5)
- N O V E S (NOVES – not common)
- N O S E S (NOSES – uses S twice, but S is already fixed at 5, so position 3 could be S, but then position 5 would have to be S, which is allowed since letters can repeat)

But we need to check if any letters in these words are excluded:
- NOTES: N, O, T, E, S – all allowed (O, T not excluded)
- NOSES: N, O, S, E, S – S is allowed, O is allowed, but S is already in position 5, and we have S in position 3 as well. This is allowed since letters can repeat.

Between NOTES and NOSES, NOTES introduces T (position 3), while NOSES introduces S again. Since S is already fixed at 5, having S at 3 is allowed but might not give new information. NOTES seems better as it tests T.

Let’s go with NOTES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. These letters are among the most frequent in English, so this should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" because it also covers common letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter coverage.

This should help us quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A.
- N is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has N and E somewhere.
- Avoids C, R, A.
- N not in position 4, E not in position 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N and E).

Good next guesses should test new common letters while placing N and E in different positions. Let's try:
- ""STONE"" – but this has S,T,O,N,E. O is common, but we might want to test more letters.
- ""UNTIE"" – but this has U,N,T,I,E. U is less common.
- ""ENEMY"" – but this has E,N,E,M,Y. Repeats E, which isn't ideal.

""STONE"" seems good because it tests S, T, O, N, E. N is in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so this would conflict. Let's avoid N in position 4.

""UNTIE"" has N in position 2, which is fine. But U is less common.

""ENEMY"" has N in position 2, E in position 1 and 3. This might be too many Es.

""ELBOW"" – but this has L,B,O,W. Let's see: E,L,B,O,W. N is missing, which we know is in the word.

""ENDUE"" – E,N,D,U,E. N in position 2, E in 1 and 5. But E is not supposed to be in position 5. So this is invalid.

""NEVER"" – N,E,V,E,R. R is excluded, so no.

""NEWEL"" – N,E,W,E,L. E in 5 is excluded.

""NEIGH"" – N,E,I,G,H. E in 2, N in 1. This seems valid. Tests N,E,I,G,H. No C,R,A. N not in 4, E not in 5. This looks good.

""NEIGH"" is a valid 5-letter word, uses N and E in new positions, and tests new common letters I, G, H.

From the new feedback on NEIGH:
- N is now in the correct position (position 1) – so the word starts with N.
- E is in the word but not in position 2.
- I, G, H are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: N (fixed at position 1), E (somewhere except position 2 or 5), plus any others not yet ruled out.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, I, G, H.
- Positions ruled out:
  – N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback).
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

That leaves positions 3 and 4 for E, or E could also be in position 1, but position 1 is already N, so E must be in 3 or 4.

Letters still available (besides N and E): B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with N, containing E in position 3 or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
N _ E _ _
N _ _ E _

Let’s brainstorm:
- N U M E R – but R is excluded.
- N U D E S – S is allowed, but is this a common word? Yes, ""NUDES"" is valid.
- N U D E D – but double D is fine, and D is allowed.
- N U M E D – but M is allowed.
- N O V E L – O, V, L allowed.
- N O T E D – O, T, D allowed.
- N O S E D – O, S, D allowed.
- N O V E L – already considered.
- N U D E S – seems good, tests U, D, S.
- N O S E T – but T is allowed, and ""NOSET"" isn't a word.
- N O S E D – ""NOSED"" is valid.

""N U D E S"" and ""N O S E D"" both fit. ""NUDES"" tests U and D, while ""NOSED"" tests O and S. Between these, ""NUDES"" introduces two new letters (U, D, S) in one go, giving more information.

But wait, ""NUDES"" has E in position 4, which is allowed (E not in 2 or 5). Let’s verify:
N (✓), U, D, E (allowed in 4), S. No excluded letters.

This seems like a strong third guess.

From the latest feedback (NUDES):
- N is fixed at position 1.
- E is now fixed at position 4.
- S is fixed at position 5.
- U and D are not in the word at all.

So the word structure is:
N _ _ E S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, I, G, H, U, D.

Letters still allowed: B, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with N, has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and uses only the allowed letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible patterns:
N _ _ E S

Let’s list valid English words fitting this pattern:
- N O V E S (NOVES – not a common word)
- N O T E S (NOTES – valid)
- N O V E S (already considered)
- N O S E S (NOSES – valid)
- N O V E S (already considered)
- N O T E S (already considered)
- N O S E S (NOSES – uses O, S, E, S – but S is already fixed at 5)
- N O V E S (NOVES – not common)
- N O S E S (NOSES – uses S twice, but S is already fixed at 5, so position 3 could be S, but then position 5 would have to be S, which is allowed since letters can repeat)

But we need to check if any letters in these words are excluded:
- NOTES: N, O, T, E, S – all allowed (O, T not excluded)
- NOSES: N, O, S, E, S – S is allowed, O is allowed, but S is already in position 5, and we have S in position 3 as well. This is allowed since letters can repeat.

Between NOTES and NOSES, NOTES introduces T (position 3), while NOSES introduces S again. Since S is already fixed at 5, having S at 3 is allowed but might not give new information. NOTES seems better as it tests T.

Let’s go with NOTES.

- S is correct in position 5.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:

Letters already excluded (from all guesses): C, R, A, I, G, H, U, D, T.

Letters still allowed for position 3: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “NO” and ends with “ES”, with the middle letter coming from the allowed set.

Common dictionary check:

- NOSES – valid (plural of “nose”)
- NOWES – archaic spelling of “wages”, but rare
- NOVES – not valid
- NOLAN – doesn’t end in ES
- NOMES – valid

Among these, the most common and unambiguous valid word is “NOSES”. It uses S in position 3 and is a recognized plural form.

Since “NOSES” uses only allowed letters (N, O, S, E, S) and fits the pattern perfectly, it must be the correct word.

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:\n\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)\n- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)\n\nLooking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. These letters are among the most frequent in English, so this should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the secret word.\n\nAnother good option is ""SLATE"" because it also covers common letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter coverage.\n\nThis should help us quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- C, R, A are NOT in the word (x).\n- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains N and E.\n- Does NOT contain C, R, A.\n- N is NOT in position 4.\n- E is NOT in position 5.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Has N and E somewhere.\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n- N not in position 4, E not in position 5.\n\nPossible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N and E).\n\nGood next guesses should test new common letters while placing N and E in different positions.

From Guess 5 (NOSES) we just received:

- N(✓) – correct in position 1  
- O(✓) – correct in position 2  
- S(-) – the letter S is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- E(✓) – correct in position 4  
- S(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the pattern is now locked to:  
N O _ E S  

and we know the missing letter (position 3) must be S, but S cannot go there (because the feedback for position 3 was “-”).  
That’s impossible, so the only explanation is that the word does NOT contain an extra S in position 3.  
Therefore the third letter must be something else entirely, yet the pattern is still N O ? E S and we have already ruled out:

C, R, A, I, G, H, U, D, T, and now we also know S is already used in positions 1 and 5, so it cannot appear again.

Hence the only remaining candidate letters for position 3 are those that have never been tried and are not yet excluded.  
From the alphabet, the still-allowed letters that fit are: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for common 5-letter English words that match N O _ E S:

- NOBES – not valid  
- NOFES – not valid  
- NOLES – valid (plural of “nolo”, a dialectal “no one”)  
- NOMES – valid (plural of “nome”, a biological term)  
- NOVES – not valid  
- NOZES – archaic, not standard  

Between “NOLES” and “NOMES”, “NOMES” is more likely to appear in standard word lists.

Therefore the next logical guess is:

NOMES
