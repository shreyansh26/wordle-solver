1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A strong starting word should contain several of these.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for elimination.

Let’s digest the new feedback on TRIOL:

T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 1  
R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 2  
I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 3  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 4  
L(x)  → L is NOT in the word  

We already knew:
- O is in position 3 (from AROSE)  
- R is in the word but NOT positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from ROUND and TRIOL)  
  ⇒ R must be in position 3, but position 3 is O ⇒ contradiction.  
Wait, let’s re-examine R placements:

From ROUND: R is NOT in position 1  
From TRIOL: R is NOT in position 2 (already known) and NOT in position 4  
Hence R can only be in position 3 or 5.  
But position 3 is O ⇒ R must be in position 5.

So we now have:
- Position 3 = O (fixed)  
- Position 5 = R (fixed)

Letters still allowed: T, I (from TRIOL, both confirmed present but misplaced), plus any not yet excluded.  
Excluded letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3  
- R in position 5  
- Contains T and I somewhere in positions 1-4  
- No A, S, E, U, N, D, L

Possible pattern: _ _ O _ R  
Available letters (excluding known bad ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We must use I and T somewhere in positions 1-4.

Let’s try to place I and T in positions 1 and 2, e.g., I T O _ R → ITOR? Not a word.  
Try I _ O T R → IOT R? Not valid.  
Try T I O _ R → TI O _ R → TI O ? R → TI O C R? TIOCR? Not valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A strong starting word should contain several of these.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for elimination.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an R, but not in position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses R in a different position (not 2).
3. Avoids A, S, E.
4. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidates: 
- FRONT (but has A, which we know is out)
- ROUND (but has U and N, which are good)
- CROOK (but has O twice, and K is less common)
- TROOP (but has O twice, and P is less common)

""ROUND"" seems best: it has O in position 3 (confirmed), R in position 1 (new position), and introduces U, N, D (all common and untested).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 must be O (from AROSE feedback).
2. R is in the word and is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and is NOT in position 1 (from ROUND).  
   Therefore R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
   But position 3 is already O, so R must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D.
4. We still need to test other common letters (T, L, I, C, M, P, etc.) while keeping O in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try a word that:
- keeps O in position 3,
- puts R in position 4 (a new placement),
- introduces T, I, and L (all common and untested),
- avoids all excluded letters.

A good candidate is “TRIOL”.  
Checking:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (required).
- No A, S, E, U, N, D appear.

Hence, TRIOL satisfies all constraints.

We already knew:
- O is in position 3 (from AROSE)  
- R is in the word but NOT positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from ROUND and TRIOL)  
  ⇒ R must be in position 3, but position 3 is O ⇒ contradiction.  
Wait, let’s re-examine R placements:

From ROUND: R is NOT in position 1  
From TRIOL: R is NOT in position 2 (already known) and NOT in position 4  
Hence R can only be in position 3 or 5.  
But position 3 is O ⇒ R must be in position 5.

So we now have:
- Position 3 = O (fixed)  
- Position 5 = R (fixed)

Letters still allowed: T, I (from TRIOL, both confirmed present but misplaced), plus any not yet excluded.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Known facts
1. Position 3 must be O (from AROSE).
2. Position 2 must be I (from TIMOR feedback: I(✓)).
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND and TIMOR feedback).  
   That leaves no possible spot for R, which is impossible.  
   Therefore my earlier deduction must have been wrong.

Re-examining R placements
- ROUND: R(✓) → R is in position 1 (correct).  
- TRIOL: R(-) → R is NOT in position 2.  
- TIMOR: R(-) → R is NOT in position 5.

So R is:
- in the word (from ROUND)  
- NOT in positions 2, 5  
- and we still have positions 3,4 open (but 3 is O).  
Hence R must be in position 4.

<guess>CHORT</guess>",CHORT,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Known facts
1. Position 3 must be O (from AROSE).
2. Position 2 must be I (from TIMOR feedback: I(✓)).
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND and TIMOR feedback).  
   That leaves no possible spot for R, which is impossible.  
   Therefore my earlier deduction must have been wrong.

Re-examining R placements
- ROUND: R(✓) → R is in position 1 (correct).  
- TRIOL: R(-) → R is NOT in position 2.  
- TIMOR: R(-) → R is NOT in position 5.

So R is:
- in the word (from ROUND)  
- NOT in positions 2, 5  
- and we still have positions 3,4 open (but 3 is O).  
Hence R must be in position 4.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A strong starting word should contain several of these.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for elimination.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an R, but not in position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses R in a different position (not 2).
3. Avoids A, S, E.
4. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidates: 
- FRONT (but has A, which we know is out)
- ROUND (but has U and N, which are good)
- CROOK (but has O twice, and K is less common)
- TROOP (but has O twice, and P is less common)

""ROUND"" seems best: it has O in position 3 (confirmed), R in position 1 (new position), and introduces U, N, D (all common and untested).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 must be O (from AROSE feedback).
2. R is in the word and is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and is NOT in position 1 (from ROUND).  
   Therefore R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
   But position 3 is already O, so R must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D.
4. We still need to test other common letters (T, L, I, C, M, P, etc.) while keeping O in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try a word that:
- keeps O in position 3,
- puts R in position 4 (a new placement),
- introduces T, I, and L (all common and untested),
- avoids all excluded letters.

A good candidate is “TRIOL”.  
Checking:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (required).
- No A, S, E, U, N, D appear.

Hence, TRIOL satisfies all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: TRIOL -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) I(-) O(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on TRIOL:

T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 1  
R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 2  
I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 3  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 4  
L(x)  → L is NOT in the word  

We already knew:
- O is in position 3 (from AROSE)  
- R is in the word but NOT positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from ROUND and TRIOL)  
  ⇒ R must be in position 3, but position 3 is O ⇒ contradiction.  
Wait, let’s re-examine R placements:

From ROUND: R is NOT in position 1  
From TRIOL: R is NOT in position 2 (already known) and NOT in position 4  
Hence R can only be in position 3 or 5.  
But position 3 is O ⇒ R must be in position 5.

So we now have:
- Position 3 = O (fixed)  
- Position 5 = R (fixed)

Letters still allowed: T, I (from TRIOL, both confirmed present but misplaced), plus any not yet excluded.  
Excluded letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3  
- R in position 5  
- Contains T and I somewhere in positions 1-4  
- No A, S, E, U, N, D, L

Possible pattern: _ _ O _ R  
Available letters (excluding known bad ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We must use I and T somewhere in positions 1-4.

Let’s try to place I and T in positions 1 and 2, e.g., I T O _ R → ITOR? Not a word.  
Try I _ O T R → IOT R? Not valid.  
Try T I O _ R → TI O _ R → TI O ? R → TI O C R? TIOCR? Not valid.  
Try T _ O I R → T _ O I R → T H O I R? THOIR? Not valid.  
Try C I T O R? But O must be in position 3.  
Try M I T O R? MITOR? Not valid.  
Try P I T O R? PITOR? Not valid.  
Try F I T O R? FITOR? Not valid.  
Try G I T O R? GITOR? Not valid.  
Try C O M I T R? Too long.  
Try B I T O R? BITOR? Not valid.  
Try C H I O T? Not matching pattern.  
Try T I M O R? TIMOR is a valid word (Timor, an island).  
Check TIMOR:
- T in position 1 (allowed, since T is in word but not fixed)  
- I in position 2 (allowed)  
- M new, allowed  
- O in position 3 (correct)  
- R in position 5 (correct)  
- No excluded letters.

Hence, TIMOR fits all constraints.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Position 3 must be O (from AROSE).  
2. Position 2 must be I (from TIMOR).  
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND and CHORT feedback).  
   That is impossible, so I must have misread.

Re-examine CHORT feedback:  
C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)  
- O(✓) position 3 – correct.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
  1: ?  
  2: I (fixed)  
  3: O (fixed)  
  4: ? (R is NOT here)  
  5: ? (T is NOT here)

R is in the word and cannot be in positions 1 (from ROUND), 2 (from TRIOL), 4 (from CHORT), or 5 (from TIMOR).  
Therefore R must be in position 3, but position 3 is O – contradiction.  
Hence my interpretation must be wrong.

Wait: ROUND feedback was R(✓) – R is in position 1.  
TIMOR feedback R(-) – R is NOT in position 5.  
CHORT feedback R(-) – R is NOT in position 4.  
So R is in position 1 (from ROUND) and must also be in position 1 (only place left).  
Thus the word starts with R.

Current pattern: R I O _ _

Letters still allowed: T (must be in word, not in position 5), plus any not excluded.  
Excluded letters: A, S, E, U, N, D, L, M, C, H.

We need a 5-letter word starting with R I O and containing T, with no other excluded letters.

Valid English word: R I O T _ → RIOTS  
- T is in position 4 (allowed, since T is in word but not fixed).  
- No excluded letters.

Hence the only possible word is RIOTS.
