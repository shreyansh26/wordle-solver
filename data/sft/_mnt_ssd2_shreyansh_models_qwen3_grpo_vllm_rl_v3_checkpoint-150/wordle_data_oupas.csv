For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

This should provide us with maximum information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (positions unknown)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, N, L, I, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed letters (A, O, S) but move them to new positions
2. Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet
3. Avoid the eliminated letters (R, E)

Possible structure: keep A, O, S but shift positions, add new consonants.

Let's try ""SOAKS"":
- S in position 1 (was position 4 before, now test position 1)
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, now test position 2)
- A in position 3 (was position 1 before, now test position 3)
- Adds new letters K and S (but S is already known to be in the word)

Wait, let's instead try ""COAST"":
- C (new letter)
- O (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

This tests new letters C and T while moving the known letters to new positions.

But actually, let's use a more optimal word that covers more new letters: ""STOAC"" isn't valid. Let's try ""SALON"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- A (known, now position 2)
- L (new)
- O (known, now position 4)
- N (new)

This covers new letters L and N while moving A and O to new positions. However, it doesn't test S in a new position.

A better choice might be ""SOLAN"" (but that's similar). Let's try ""SALON"" as it's valid and tests new letters.

But to maximize information, let's use ""STOIC"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- T (new)
- O (known, now position 3)
- I (new)
- C (new)

This tests T, I, C while moving S and O to new positions.

After considering these, ""STOIC"" seems good as it tests many new letters and moves the known ones.

But actually, let's use ""SALON"" as it's more straightforward with known letters.

Wait, let's choose ""SALON"" to test:
- S in position 1 (was 4)
- A in position 2 (was 1)
- L new
- O in position 4 (was 3)
- N new

- A cannot be in position 2 → must be in 1,3,4,5
- O cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1,2,3,5

We also want to introduce new common consonants (T, C, D, M, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

This should provide us with maximum information about the secret word's composition.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (positions unknown)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, N, L, I, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed letters (A, O, S) but move them to new positions
2. Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet
3. Avoid the eliminated letters (R, E)

Possible structure: keep A, O, S but shift positions, add new consonants.

Let's try ""SOAKS"":
- S in position 1 (was position 4 before, now test position 1)
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, now test position 2)
- A in position 3 (was position 1 before, now test position 3)
- Adds new letters K and S (but S is already known to be in the word)

Wait, let's instead try ""COAST"":
- C (new letter)
- O (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

This tests new letters C and T while moving the known letters to new positions.

But actually, let's use a more optimal word that covers more new letters: ""STOAC"" isn't valid. Let's try ""SALON"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- A (known, now position 2)
- L (new)
- O (known, now position 4)
- N (new)

This covers new letters L and N while moving A and O to new positions. However, it doesn't test S in a new position.

A better choice might be ""SOLAN"" (but that's similar). Let's try ""SALON"" as it's valid and tests new letters.

But to maximize information, let's use ""STOIC"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- T (new)
- O (known, now position 3)
- I (new)
- C (new)

This tests T, I, C while moving S and O to new positions.

After considering these, ""STOIC"" seems good as it tests many new letters and moves the known ones.

But actually, let's use ""SALON"" as it's more straightforward with known letters.

Wait, let's choose ""SALON"" to test:
- S in position 1 (was 4)
- A in position 2 (was 1)
- L new
- O in position 4 (was 3)
- N new

This gives us good coverage. Let's go with ""SALON"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: salon -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, O, S
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E

Round 2: salon → S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
- S is still misplaced (position 1)
- A is still misplaced (position 2)
- O is still misplaced (position 4)
- L and N are NOT in the word

So we now know:
- The word contains A, O, S (each must appear exactly once, since they were only marked “in word” once)
- The word does NOT contain: R, E, L, N
- Positions 1, 2, 4 cannot be S, A, O respectively (because those were marked “-” in those exact spots)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S exactly once each
- Avoids R, E, L, N
- Places A somewhere other than position 2
- Places O somewhere other than position 4
- Places S somewhere other than position 1

Let’s try to place the known letters in new positions:
- S cannot be in position 1 → must be in 2,3,4,5
- A cannot be in position 2 → must be in 1,3,4,5
- O cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1,2,3,5

We also want to introduce new common consonants (T, C, D, M, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “COAST”:
- C (new letter)
- O (known, now in position 2)
- A (known, now in position 3)
- S (known, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

Check constraints:
- Contains C, O, A, S, T
- No R, E, L, N
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 2)
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 1)

This seems valid and tests new letters C and T.

From the three rounds so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, O, S are in the word but misplaced.
   - R, E are NOT in the word.

2. salon → S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
   - L, N are NOT in the word.
   - S cannot be in position 1.
   - A cannot be in position 2.
   - O cannot be in position 4.

3. coast → C(x) O(-) A(-) S(-) T(x)
   - C, T are NOT in the word.
   - O cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - S cannot be in position 4.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (each exactly once).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T.
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → A must be in 1, 4, or 5.
  – O cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → O must be in 1, 3, or 5.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → S must be in 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S exactly once each.
- Avoids R, E, L, N, C, T.
- Satisfies the positional restrictions above.

Let’s list possible positions for A, O, S:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

A: 1,4,5
O: 1,3,5
S: 2,3,5

We must assign A, O, S to three different positions while respecting the above.

Try to place A in position 1:
Then O and S must go in positions 3,5 (since O can’t be in 2,4 and S can’t be in 1,4).
But O can be in 3 or 5, S can be in 2,3,5.

If A=1, O=3, then S must be 2 or 5. But S can’t be 4 (already excluded), so 2 or 5.
If S=2: then word starts A S _ O _ → need two more letters (not R,E,L,N,C,T). Available letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
ASO _ _ → need two more letters. Possible: ASOGY, ASOKY, etc. but must be valid word.

ASOGY is not a word. ASOKY is not a word. ASO is not a valid 5-letter word with S in 2 and O in 3.

Try S=5: then A=1, O must be 3 (since 5 is taken by S). So A S _ O S – but S is duplicated, which is invalid (S must appear once).

Thus A cannot be in 1.

Try A in position 4:
Then O can be 1,3,5 (not 2,4).
S can be 2,3,5 (not 1,4).

Let’s try O=1, S=2,3,5.

If O=1, A=4, then S can be 2,3,5.

Case 1: S=2 → O _ S A _ → need two letters for positions 2 and 5 (but S is in 2). Wait: positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
So word would be O S _ A _ → need position 3 and 5. Available letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible: O S D A Y, O S K A P, etc. Check if valid.

OSDAY – not a word. OSKAP – not a word. 

Case 2: S=3 → O _ S A _ → positions 2 and 5. Need valid word.
O _ S A _ → O M S A D, O H S A D – not valid.

Case 3: S=5 → O _ _ A S → positions 2,3. Need two letters.
O D D A S – invalid. O M I A S – not a word.

Try O=3, A=4:
Then S can be 2,5 (since 3 is taken by O, 4 by A).
S must be 2 or 5.

If S=2: _ S O A _ → need positions 1 and 5. Valid word: D S O A P – not valid.
H S O A M – not valid.

If S=5: _ _ O A S → positions 1,2. Need two letters.
D G O A S – not valid. M O O A S – invalid (O duplicated).

Try O=5, A=4:
Then S can be 2,3 (since 5 is taken by O, 4 by A).
S must be 2 or 3.

If S=2: _ S _ A 5 → _ S _ A O → need position 3. Valid word: D S P A O – not valid.
H S M A O – not valid.

If S=3: _ _ S A O → positions 1,2. Need two letters.
D M S A O – not valid. H M S A O – not valid.

Hmm, let’s try A=5:
Then O can be 1,3 (cannot be 2,4,5).
S can be 2,3 (cannot be 1,4,5).

Case 1: O=1, S=2 → O S _ _ 5 → need positions 3,4. Valid word: O S D I 5 – not valid.
O S M A 5 – but A is 5, so O S M A 5 is OSM**A**5 – not a word.

Case 2: O=1, S=3 → O _ S _ 5 → positions 2,4. Need letters: O D S P 5 – not valid.
O H S M 5 – not valid.

Case 3: O=3, S=2 → _ S O _ 5 → positions 1,4. Valid word: D S O M 5 – not valid.
H S O M 5 – not valid.

Case 4: O=3, S=5 → _ _ O _ S → positions 1,2,4. Need three letters, but we only have two letters left to place (since A is 5, O is 3, S is 5). Wait, we have A, O, S already placed, so need two more letters for positions 1,2,4.

But we have 5 positions, and we have placed A (5), O (3), S (5) – but S is already in 5, so positions 1,2,4 need two letters. This seems impossible.

Wait, let’s re-examine: we have 5 positions, and we must place A, O, S plus two other letters (not R,E,L,N,C,T). The other letters must be from: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me try a different approach: list all possible positions for A, O, S that satisfy the restrictions, then see if any valid word can be formed.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5 (but 1 and 4/5 are conflicting with O/S)
Possible positions for O: 1,3,5
Possible positions for S: 2,3,5

Let’s try A=4, O=3, S=2:
Then word is _ S O A _ → positions 1 and 5. Need two letters.
Valid word: D S O A Y – not valid. H S O A M – not valid.

Try A=4, O=5, S=2:
_ S _ A O → positions 1,3. Need two letters.
D S P A O – not valid.

Try A=4, O=1, S=3:
O _ S A _ → positions 2,5. Need two letters.
O M S A D – not valid.

Try A=5, O=1, S=3:
O _ S _ 5 → positions 2,4. Need two letters.
O D S P 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=3, S=2:
_ S O _ 5 → positions 1,4. Need two letters.
D S O M 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=1, S=2:
O S _ _ 5 → positions 3,4. Need two letters.
O S D I 5 – not valid.

Try A=4, O=3, S=5:
_ _ O A S → positions 1,2. Need two letters.
D M O A S – not valid.

This seems difficult. Let me think of actual 5-letter words that contain A, O, S and avoid R,E,L,N,C,T.

Possible letters left: A, O, S, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct:

- S must be in 2,3,5
- A must be in 1,4,5
- O must be in 1,3,5

Try word: D A S O W – but A is 2, which is invalid (A cannot be 2).

Try word: S A D O W – S is 1 (invalid), A is 2 (invalid).

Try word: D O S A M – O is 2 (invalid), A is 4 (valid), S is 3 (valid). But O is 2 is invalid.

Try word: M A S O D – A is 2 (invalid).

Try word: S O A D Y – S is 1 (invalid), O is 2 (invalid).

Try word: D A O S Y – A is 2 (invalid).

Try word: D S O A M – S is 2 (valid), O is 3 (valid), A is 4 (valid). This seems valid: D S O A M → DSOAM – not a word.

Try word: H A S O M – A is 2 (invalid).

Try word: S H A O D – S is 1 (invalid).

Try word: S O H A D – S is 1 (invalid), O is 2 (invalid).

Try word: A S O D Y – A is 1 (valid), S is 2 (valid), O is 3 (valid). This uses A, S, O and two new letters (D,Y). The word is ASODY – not valid.

Try word: A D O S Y – A is 1 (valid), O is 3 (valid), S is 4 (invalid, S cannot be 4).

Try word: A D S O Y – A is 1 (valid), D is 2, S is 3 (valid), O is 4 (invalid).

Try word: A S D O Y – A is 1 (valid), S is 2 (valid), D is 3, O is 4 (invalid).

Try word: A S D O Y – same issue.

Try word: A S H O D – A is 1 (valid), S is 2 (valid), H is 3, O is 4 (invalid).

Try word: A S M O D – same issue.

Try word: A S P O D – same issue.

Try word: A S D O W – same issue.

Try word: A S D O M – same issue.

Try word: A S D O K – same issue.

This seems impossible. Let me try A=5, O=3, S=2:
Word: _ S O _ 5 → positions 1,4. Need two letters.
Valid word: H S O M 5 – not valid.

Try word: D S O M 5 – not valid.

Try word: P S O M 5 – not valid.

Try word: G S O M 5 – not valid.

Try word: S O D A M – but A is 4 (valid), S is 1 (invalid), O is 2 (invalid).

Try word: S O D A M – S is 1 (invalid).

Try word: S O D A M – same.

Try word: S O D A M – invalid.

I think I need to consider that maybe the word has A, O, S plus two other letters, and the positions must satisfy the constraints.

Let me try A=4, O=1, S=5:
O _ _ A S → positions 2,3. Need two letters.
O D D A S – invalid.
O M I A S – not a word.

Try A=4, O=1, S=2:
O S _ A _ → positions 3,5. Need two letters.
O S D A Y – not valid.

Try A=4, O=3, S=5:
_ _ O A S → positions 1,2. Need two letters.
D M O A S – not valid.

Try A=5, O=1, S=3:
O _ S _ 5 → positions 2,4. Need two letters.
O D S P 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=3, S=2:
_ S O _ 5 → positions 1,4. Need two letters.
D S O M 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=1, S=2:
O S _ _ 5 → positions 3,4. Need two letters.
O S D I 5 – not valid.

This seems impossible with common letters. Let me try a word: ""SOAPY"" – but Y is allowed, and letters are S,O,A,P,Y. But we don't have P yet.

Wait, we have not used P yet. Let me try:

A must be 1,4,5
O must be 1,3,5
S must be 2,3,5

Try A=4, O=1, S=2:
O S _ A _ → positions 3,5. Need two letters. Valid word: O S D A Y – not valid.

Try A=4, O=3, S=2:
_ S O A _ → positions 1,5. Valid word: D S O A Y – not valid.

Try A=5, O=3, S=2:
_ S O _ 5 → positions 1,4. Valid word: D S O M 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=1, S=3:
O _ S _ 5 → positions 2,4. Valid word: O D S P 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=1, S=2:
O S _ _ 5 → positions 3,4. Valid word: O S D I 5 – not valid.

Try A=5, O=3, S=5 – but S cannot be 5 if A is 5.

I think I need to try a word that actually exists. Let me think of words with A, O, S and avoid R,E,L,N,C,T.

Possible word: ""SADHO"" – not valid.

""SAMOA"" – has A twice (invalid).

""SAOUI"" – not valid.

""SAVOY"" – has S,A,V,O,Y. This is valid.

Check constraints:
S A V O Y
- Contains S,A,O (each once) – valid.
- Avoids R,E,L,N,C,T – valid.
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be 2 or 3 → A is 2 – invalid (A is 2).

Try ""SVOAD"" – not valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

This should provide us with maximum information about the secret word's composition.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (positions unknown)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, N, L, I, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed letters (A, O, S) but move them to new positions
2. Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet
3. Avoid the eliminated letters (R, E)

Possible structure: keep A, O, S but shift positions, add new consonants.

Let's try ""SOAKS"":
- S in position 1 (was position 4 before, now test position 1)
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, now test position 2)
- A in position 3 (was position 1 before, now test position 3)
- Adds new letters K and S (but S is already known to be in the word)

Wait, let's instead try ""COAST"":
- C (new letter)
- O (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

This tests new letters C and T while moving the known letters to new positions.

But actually, let's use a more optimal word that covers more new letters: ""STOAC"" isn't valid. Let's try ""SALON"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- A (known, now position 2)
- L (new)
- O (known, now position 4)
- N (new)

This covers new letters L and N while moving A and O to new positions. However, it doesn't test S in a new position.

A better choice might be ""SOLAN"" (but that's similar). Let's try ""SALON"" as it's valid and tests new letters.

But to maximize information, let's use ""STOIC"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- T (new)
- O (known, now position 3)
- I (new)
- C (new)

This tests T, I, C while moving S and O to new positions.

After considering these, ""STOIC"" seems good as it tests many new letters and moves the known ones.

But actually, let's use ""SALON"" as it's more straightforward with known letters.

Wait, let's choose ""SALON"" to test:
- S in position 1 (was 4)
- A in position 2 (was 1)
- L new
- O in position 4 (was 3)
- N new

This gives us good coverage. Let's go with ""SALON"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: salon -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, O, S
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E

Round 2: salon → S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
- S is still misplaced (position 1)
- A is still misplaced (position 2)
- O is still misplaced (position 4)
- L and N are NOT in the word

So we now know:
- The word contains A, O, S (each must appear exactly once, since they were only marked “in word” once)
- The word does NOT contain: R, E, L, N
- Positions 1, 2, 4 cannot be S, A, O respectively (because those were marked “-” in those exact spots)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S exactly once each
- Avoids R, E, L, N
- Places A somewhere other than position 2
- Places O somewhere other than position 4
- Places S somewhere other than position 1

Let’s try to place the known letters in new positions:
- S cannot be in position 1 → must be in 2,3,4,5
- A cannot be in position 2 → must be in 1,3,4,5
- O cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1,2,3,5

We also want to introduce new common consonants (T, C, D, M, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “COAST”:
- C (new letter)
- O (known, now in position 2)
- A (known, now in position 3)
- S (known, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

Check constraints:
- Contains C, O, A, S, T
- No R, E, L, N
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 2)
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 1)

This seems valid and tests new letters C and T.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

This should provide us with maximum information about the secret word's composition.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (positions unknown)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, N, L, I, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed letters (A, O, S) but move them to new positions
2. Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet
3. Avoid the eliminated letters (R, E)

Possible structure: keep A, O, S but shift positions, add new consonants.

Let's try ""SOAKS"":
- S in position 1 (was position 4 before, now test position 1)
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, now test position 2)
- A in position 3 (was position 1 before, now test position 3)
- Adds new letters K and S (but S is already known to be in the word)

Wait, let's instead try ""COAST"":
- C (new letter)
- O (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

This tests new letters C and T while moving the known letters to new positions.

But actually, let's use a more optimal word that covers more new letters: ""STOAC"" isn't valid. Let's try ""SALON"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- A (known, now position 2)
- L (new)
- O (known, now position 4)
- N (new)

This covers new letters L and N while moving A and O to new positions. However, it doesn't test S in a new position.

A better choice might be ""SOLAN"" (but that's similar). Let's try ""SALON"" as it's valid and tests new letters.

But to maximize information, let's use ""STOIC"":
- S (known, now position 1)
- T (new)
- O (known, now position 3)
- I (new)
- C (new)

This tests T, I, C while moving S and O to new positions.

After considering these, ""STOIC"" seems good as it tests many new letters and moves the known ones.

But actually, let's use ""SALON"" as it's more straightforward with known letters.

Wait, let's choose ""SALON"" to test:
- S in position 1 (was 4)
- A in position 2 (was 1)
- L new
- O in position 4 (was 3)
- N new

This gives us good coverage. Let's go with ""SALON"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: salon -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, O, S
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E

Round 2: salon → S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
- S is still misplaced (position 1)
- A is still misplaced (position 2)
- O is still misplaced (position 4)
- L and N are NOT in the word

So we now know:
- The word contains A, O, S (each must appear exactly once, since they were only marked “in word” once)
- The word does NOT contain: R, E, L, N
- Positions 1, 2, 4 cannot be S, A, O respectively (because those were marked “-” in those exact spots)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S exactly once each
- Avoids R, E, L, N
- Places A somewhere other than position 2
- Places O somewhere other than position 4
- Places S somewhere other than position 1

Let’s try to place the known letters in new positions:
- S cannot be in position 1 → must be in 2,3,4,5
- A cannot be in position 2 → must be in 1,3,4,5
- O cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1,2,3,5

We also want to introduce new common consonants (T, C, D, M, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “COAST”:
- C (new letter)
- O (known, now in position 2)
- A (known, now in position 3)
- S (known, now in position 4)
- T (new letter)

Check constraints:
- Contains C, O, A, S, T
- No R, E, L, N
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 2)
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 1)

This seems valid and tests new letters C and T.

The feedback for ""d o a m s"" says the model answer is not five letters.  
That means the guess must be given as a single string, not with spaces.

Also, from earlier feedback we know:
- The word contains A, O, S exactly once each (because each was marked “-” only once).
- The word does NOT contain: R, E, L, N, C, T.
- Position constraints:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5
  – O cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5
  – S cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5

We still need two more distinct consonants from the unused pool: D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters while satisfying all constraints.

One valid arrangement:
- O in 2
- S in 5
- A in 3
- New consonants in 1 and 4: pick D and G → O D A G S (but “ODAGS” isn’t a word)

Another arrangement:
- O in 1
- S in 2
- A in 5
- New consonants in 3 and 4: pick D and M → O S D M A (again, not a word)

Another pattern:
- O in 5
- S in 2
- A in 3
- New consonants in 1 and 4: pick H and D → H S A D O (not a word)

Try G and D:
- O in 2
- S in 5
- A in 3
- G in 1, D in 4 → G O A D S (valid English word “GOADS”)

Check constraints:
- Contains A, O, S exactly once ✔
- No forbidden letters ✔
- A in 3 (allowed) ✔
- O in 2 (allowed) ✔
- S in 5 (allowed) ✔
- New letters G and D ✔

This is a valid guess.
