### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word, helping narrow down future guesses. I'll go with AROSE.

So far we know:
- Positions: _ O _ E _
- Letters present: O, S, E

- S is somewhere other than position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.
2. Contains S exactly once, not in position 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D).

Possible patterns: _ O _ E _
Let’s list valid letters for the blanks: common consonants not yet used or ruled out include B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

We need to place S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be in 3).

Option 1: S in position 1 → S O _ E _
Option 2: S in position 5 → _ O _ E S

For each option, we need a valid letter for the remaining blank (not A, R, P, D, and not repeating O or E or S).

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for the third position: common ones not ruled out are B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y.  
""SOBES"" is invalid (B and S already, but S is used twice).  
""SONIC"" is invalid (positions don’t fit).  
""SOLES"" has S twice.  
""SOFES"" has F and S, but S is used twice.  
""SONGS"" has S twice.  

Let’s try _ O _ E S. The first and third positions need letters.  
Possible: ""COVES"" – C and V are new, no repeats.  
""FOGES"" – F and G are new.  
""MOGES"" – M and G.  
""WOLES"" – W and L.  
""BOGES"" – B and G.  

""COVES"" seems good: C, O, V, E, S – all new letters except O and E which we know are correct, and S is in position 5 (allowed since it wasn’t in 3).

Let me verify:
- C: new, not ruled out.
- O: correct in position 2.
- V: new, not ruled out.
- E: correct in position 4.
- S: new position 5 (allowed since previous S was in 3 and marked wrong position).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word, helping narrow down future guesses. I'll go with AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I want a word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in new positions.
2. Adds new common letters to test.
3. Avoids A and R.

Good candidates: ""POSED"", ""SPOKE"", ""SLOPE"", ""POSES"", etc.  
""POSED"" uses P, O, S, E, D and places O in position 2, S in position 3, E in position 4 (none of the forbidden positions), and introduces P and D to test new letters.

Let me go with POSED.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 and is correct.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 and is correct.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions: _ O _ E _
- Letters present: O, S, E
- Letters absent: A, R, P, D
- S is somewhere other than position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.
2. Contains S exactly once, not in position 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D).

Possible patterns: _ O _ E _
Let’s list valid letters for the blanks: common consonants not yet used or ruled out include B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

We need to place S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be in 3).

Option 1: S in position 1 → S O _ E _
Option 2: S in position 5 → _ O _ E S

For each option, we need a valid letter for the remaining blank (not A, R, P, D, and not repeating O or E or S).

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for the third position: common ones not ruled out are B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y.  
""SOBES"" is invalid (B and S already, but S is used twice).  
""SONIC"" is invalid (positions don’t fit).  
""SOLES"" has S twice.  
""SOFES"" has F and S, but S is used twice.  
""SONGS"" has S twice.  

Let’s try _ O _ E S. The first and third positions need letters.  
Possible: ""COVES"" – C and V are new, no repeats.  
""FOGES"" – F and G are new.  
""MOGES"" – M and G.  
""WOLES"" – W and L.  
""BOGES"" – B and G.  

""COVES"" seems good: C, O, V, E, S – all new letters except O and E which we know are correct, and S is in position 5 (allowed since it wasn’t in 3).

Let me verify:
- C: new, not ruled out.
- O: correct in position 2.
- V: new, not ruled out.
- E: correct in position 4.
- S: new position 5 (allowed since previous S was in 3 and marked wrong position).

So COVES fits all constraints.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word, helping narrow down future guesses. I'll go with AROSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I want a word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in new positions.
2. Adds new common letters to test.
3. Avoids A and R.

Good candidates: ""POSED"", ""SPOKE"", ""SLOPE"", ""POSES"", etc.  
""POSED"" uses P, O, S, E, D and places O in position 2, S in position 3, E in position 4 (none of the forbidden positions), and introduces P and D to test new letters.

Let me go with POSED.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 and is correct.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 and is correct.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions: _ O _ E _
- Letters present: O, S, E
- Letters absent: A, R, P, D
- S is somewhere other than position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.
2. Contains S exactly once, not in position 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D).

Possible patterns: _ O _ E _
Let’s list valid letters for the blanks: common consonants not yet used or ruled out include B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

We need to place S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be in 3).

Option 1: S in position 1 → S O _ E _
Option 2: S in position 5 → _ O _ E S

For each option, we need a valid letter for the remaining blank (not A, R, P, D, and not repeating O or E or S).

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for the third position: common ones not ruled out are B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y.  
""SOBES"" is invalid (B and S already, but S is used twice).  
""SONIC"" is invalid (positions don’t fit).  
""SOLES"" has S twice.  
""SOFES"" has F and S, but S is used twice.  
""SONGS"" has S twice.  

Let’s try _ O _ E S. The first and third positions need letters.  
Possible: ""COVES"" – C and V are new, no repeats.  
""FOGES"" – F and G are new.  
""MOGES"" – M and G.  
""WOLES"" – W and L.  
""BOGES"" – B and G.  

""COVES"" seems good: C, O, V, E, S – all new letters except O and E which we know are correct, and S is in position 5 (allowed since it wasn’t in 3).

Let me verify:
- C: new, not ruled out.
- O: correct in position 2.
- V: new, not ruled out.
- E: correct in position 4.
- S: new position 5 (allowed since previous S was in 3 and marked wrong position).

So COVES fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: COVES -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on COVES:
- C(✓) → C is in position 1 and is correct.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 and is correct.
- V(x) → V is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 and is correct.
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 and is correct.

So the word is now fully determined: C O _ E S.

The only missing letter is in position 3. It must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out (not A, R, P, D, V) and must form a valid 5-letter word with the pattern C O _ E S.

Possible letters for position 3 (common, not yet excluded): B, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking at valid words:
- COBES → not a valid word.
- COFES → not valid.
- COGES → not valid.
- COHES → ""COHES"" is valid (though rare, ""cohes"" is a variant of ""cohesive"").
- COMES → valid and common.
- CONES → valid.
- COTES → valid (as in ""cotes"" plural of cote).
- COWES → valid (archaic for ""cowers"").

Among these, ""COMES"" is the most common and likely correct.

Thus, the word must be ""COMES"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on COMES:
- C(✓) → position 1 correct
- O(✓) → position 2 correct
- M(x) → M is not in the word
- E(✓) → position 4 correct
- S(✓) → position 5 correct

So the pattern is locked to: C O _ E S

We know the third letter must be:
- Not any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, P, D, V, M
- Must form a valid 5-letter word with C O _ E S

Possible remaining consonants for position 3: B, F, G, H, L, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Valid dictionary words fitting C O _ E S:
- COBES – not valid
- COFES – not valid
- COGES – not valid
- COHES – valid (archaic but listed)
- COMES – already tried, M ruled out
- CONES – valid
- COTES – valid
- COWES – archaic

Between CONES, COTES, and COHES, ""COTES"" is the most common and likely correct.

So the final guess is COTES.
