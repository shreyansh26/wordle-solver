For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common in word endings.

I'll go with AROSE as it's a well-balanced first guess.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: R (must appear, but not in position 2 or 3) and E (must appear, but not in position 5 or 4).

So the word contains both R and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions we can use for R: 1, 4, 5  
Positions we can use for E: 1, 2, 3  

Let’s try to place R in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “REBEL”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, L are still allowed
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, D)
- Second E is allowed since we only know one E exists, but the feedback only tells us one E is wrong-positioned; the word could have two Es.

However, we should check if REBEL violates any constraints. The word must have R and E, and REBEL has both, with R not in positions 2 or 3, and E not in positions 4 or 5. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “REHAB” – but H and B are allowed, but we have A which is forbidden.

“RELIC” – but I is forbidden.

“RENAL” – but A is forbidden.

“REPLY” – P, L, Y are allowed, no forbidden letters.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: R (must appear, but not in position 2 or 3) and E (must appear, but not in position 5 or 4).

So the word contains both R and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions we can use for R: 1, 4, 5  
Positions we can use for E: 1, 2, 3  

Let’s try to place R in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “REBEL”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, L are still allowed
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, D)
- Second E is allowed since we only know one E exists, but the feedback only tells us one E is wrong-positioned; the word could have two Es.

However, we should check if REBEL violates any constraints. The word must have R and E, and REBEL has both, with R not in positions 2 or 3, and E not in positions 4 or 5. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “REHAB” – but H and B are allowed, but we have A which is forbidden.

“RELIC” – but I is forbidden.

“RENAL” – but A is forbidden.

“REPLY” – P, L, Y are allowed, no forbidden letters.

I’ll choose REPLY as it uses common remaining letters and fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback:

- R(✓) – R is in the correct position (position 1).
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position (position 2).
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So far we know the word starts with “RE”.  
Letters still required: three more letters (positions 3-5).  
Forbidden letters (from all feedback): A, O, S, T, I, D, P, L, Y.  
Allowed letters (from the alphabet minus the forbidden ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need three more letters for positions 3-5, chosen only from the allowed set.  
We also have no positional restrictions on these three letters (since we’ve only established R and E are correct in positions 1 and 2).

To maximize information, we’ll pick common remaining letters: N, C, K, M, B, H, etc.  
A common pattern that fits is “RE + N + C + K” → “RENC” but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “RECK” plus one more letter.  
“REC” is a good stem, but we need three more letters.  
A valid word that starts with “RE” and uses only allowed letters: “RECK” + “N” → “RECKN” is invalid.  
Wait, let’s list possible words: “REBEC”, “REBID”, “RECUT”, “REDUX”, etc. – but many contain forbidden letters or positions.

A valid word: “REBEC” – but C is allowed, E is already used.

Another: “RECKS” – but S is forbidden.  
Another: “RECKY” – Y is forbidden.

Another: “REBUT” – T is forbidden.

Another: “REBEC” – valid, but C and B are allowed.

Actually, let’s think of “REBEC” as a valid word (an ancient stringed instrument). It uses B, E, C – all allowed.  
But we need to check if it’s 5 letters: yes, R-E-B-E-C.  
However, we already have E in position 2, so the second E in “REBEC” would be in position 4 – we have no info against a second E.

But we should avoid assuming duplicates. Let’s instead pick a word with distinct letters.  
A better choice: “RECK” + “N” → “RECKN” invalid.  
Let’s pick “RECK” + “S” → “RECKS” – S is forbidden.

Let’s try “RECK” + “H” → “RECKH” invalid.  
Let’s try “RECK” + “M” → “RECKM” invalid.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common in word endings.

I'll go with AROSE as it's a well-balanced first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R and E.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain A, O, or S.
- Has R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

I’ll look for a word with R and E plus some of these other letters. One candidate is “TIRED”:
- T, I, D are still allowed.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- No A, O, or S.
- R and E are both present.

Let me check another candidate: “CREPT” – but P and T are allowed, but E is in position 4 (allowed), R in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

“PERKY” – but Y is allowed, but E is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed), no A, O, S. This seems valid too.

But “TIRED” seems more common and uses T and I which are high-frequency.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common in word endings.

I'll go with AROSE as it's a well-balanced first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R and E.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain A, O, or S.
- Has R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

I’ll look for a word with R and E plus some of these other letters. One candidate is “TIRED”:
- T, I, D are still allowed.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- No A, O, or S.
- R and E are both present.

Let me check another candidate: “CREPT” – but P and T are allowed, but E is in position 4 (allowed), R in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

“PERKY” – but Y is allowed, but E is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed), no A, O, S. This seems valid too.

But “TIRED” seems more common and uses T and I which are high-frequency.

I’ll go with TIRED.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: R (must appear, but not in position 2 or 3) and E (must appear, but not in position 5 or 4).

So the word contains both R and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions we can use for R: 1, 4, 5  
Positions we can use for E: 1, 2, 3  

Let’s try to place R in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “REBEL”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, L are still allowed
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, D)
- Second E is allowed since we only know one E exists, but the feedback only tells us one E is wrong-positioned; the word could have two Es.

However, we should check if REBEL violates any constraints. The word must have R and E, and REBEL has both, with R not in positions 2 or 3, and E not in positions 4 or 5. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “REHAB” – but H and B are allowed, but we have A which is forbidden.

“RELIC” – but I is forbidden.

“RENAL” – but A is forbidden.

“REPLY” – P, L, Y are allowed, no forbidden letters.

I’ll choose REPLY as it uses common remaining letters and fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback:

- E(✓) – E is in the correct position (position 2).
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So far we know the word starts with “RE”.  
Letters still required: three more letters (positions 3-5).  
Forbidden letters (from all feedback): A, O, S, T, I, D, P, L, Y.  
Allowed letters (from the alphabet minus the forbidden ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need three more letters for positions 3-5, chosen only from the allowed set.  
We also have no positional restrictions on these three letters (since we’ve only established R and E are correct in positions 1 and 2).

To maximize information, we’ll pick common remaining letters: N, C, K, M, B, H, etc.  
A common pattern that fits is “RE + N + C + K” → “RENC” but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “RECK” plus one more letter.  
“REC” is a good stem, but we need three more letters.  
A valid word that starts with “RE” and uses only allowed letters: “RECK” + “N” → “RECKN” is invalid.  
Wait, let’s list possible words: “REBEC”, “REBID”, “RECUT”, “REDUX”, etc. – but many contain forbidden letters or positions.

A valid word: “REBEC” – but C is allowed, E is already used.  
Another: “RECKO” – but O is forbidden.  
Another: “RECKS” – but S is forbidden.  
Another: “RECKY” – Y is forbidden.  
Another: “REBID” – I and D are forbidden.  
Another: “REBUS” – S is forbidden.  
Another: “REBUT” – T is forbidden.  
Another: “RECAP” – A and P are forbidden.  
Another: “REBUY” – Y is forbidden.  
Another: “REBEC” – valid, but C and B are allowed.

Actually, let’s think of “REBEC” as a valid word (an ancient stringed instrument). It uses B, E, C – all allowed.  
But we need to check if it’s 5 letters: yes, R-E-B-E-C.  
However, we already have E in position 2, so the second E in “REBEC” would be in position 4 – we have no info against a second E.

But we should avoid assuming duplicates. Let’s instead pick a word with distinct letters.  
A better choice: “RECK” + “N” → “RECKN” invalid.  
Let’s pick “RECK” + “S” → “RECKS” – S is forbidden.  
Let’s pick “RECK” + “Y” → “RECKY” – Y is forbidden.

Let’s try “RECK” + “H” → “RECKH” invalid.  
Let’s try “RECK” + “M” → “RECKM” invalid.

Let’s try “RECK” + “N” → “RECKN” invalid.

Let’s try “REBEC” – it’s a valid word, uses allowed letters, and fits “RE” at start.

But to maximize common letters, let’s try “REBEC”.

However, let’s think of a more common word: “REBEC” is obscure.  
Another: “REBID” – I and D forbidden.  
Another: “RECUT” – T forbidden.  
Another: “REDUX” – X allowed, but D and U – D forbidden.  
Another: “REBEC” seems the only valid 5-letter word starting with RE using allowed letters.

Wait, let’s try “REBEC”.

But let’s check another: “REBEC” is valid.  
Let’s go with “REBEC” as the next guess.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.\n\nAnother excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common in word endings.\n\nI\'ll go with AROSE as it\'s a well-balanced first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.\n- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).\n- O(x) – O is not in the word.\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters to exclude: A, O, S.\n- Letters that must appear somewhere: R and E.\n- R cannot be in position 2.\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R and E.\n- Does not contain A, O, or S.\n- Has R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nGood remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.\n\nI’ll look for a word with R and E plus some of these other letters.

We now have:

- R(✓) E(✓) _ _ _   (positions 1 & 2 locked)
- Exactly one more E must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (position 4 is ruled out for E by RENEW’s feedback).
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, T, I, D, P, L, Y, B, C, N, W.
- Allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

We need three letters for positions 3-5, one of which must be E (in position 3 or 5), and the other two must come from the allowed set.

Possible patterns:

1. RE E _ _  →  E must be in position 3, then positions 4-5 need two allowed letters.
   - RE E F _ → REEF?  (needs 5 letters) REEFK invalid, REEFM invalid…
   - RE E G _ → REEG?  no valid word.
   - RE E H _ → REEH?  no.
   - RE E K _ → REEK?  no.
   - RE E M _ → REEM?  yes!  “REEM” is a valid word (variant spelling of “rare” in some dialects/Scrabble lists).

2. RE _ _ E  →  E must be in position 5, then positions 3-4 need two allowed letters.
   - RE F K E → REKFE invalid.
   - RE G H E → REGHE invalid.
   - RE H K E → REKHE invalid.
   - RE M K E → REMKE invalid.
   - RE H M E → REHME invalid.
   - RE K M E → REKME invalid.
   - RE G M E → REGME invalid.

Only valid word fitting the pattern is “REEM” (pattern RE E M).

Let’s check “REEM”:
- R(✓) E(✓) E(-) M(?)  →  M is allowed.
- It uses only allowed letters and satisfies the single additional E requirement.

Hence, the next logical guess is “REEM”.
