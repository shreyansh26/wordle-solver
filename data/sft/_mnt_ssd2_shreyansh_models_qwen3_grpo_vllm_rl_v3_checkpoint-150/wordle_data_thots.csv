### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these without repeating letters. 

Popular choices include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has T in position 4.
- It contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 1.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Good next steps:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Try to place S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. Use other common letters that haven't been ruled out (R, I, N, O, C, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- STRIP (good, uses S, T, R, I, P)
- SNORT (but O and R might be too many new letters)
- SNOUT (but U is less common)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, E are absent.

2. STRIP → S(-) T(-) R(x) I(x) P(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - T is now marked “-” (wrong position), but we already know from round 1 that T is in position 4.  
     This feedback is contradictory unless interpreted as “T is in the word but not in position 2” (which is redundant because we already know it’s in position 4).  
     Assuming the feedback is consistent, we can safely treat T as locked in position 4.
   - R, I, P are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Must contain S (not in position 1).
- Cannot contain: L, A, E, R, I, P.

Remaining common letters to try: N, O, C, D, G, H, U, M, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ T _ with S somewhere and no forbidden letters:
- SNOUT (contains N, O, U, T, S) – but U is less common.
- SMOKE – contains M, O, K, E, S – E is ruled out.
- SOUND – contains O, U, N, D, S – but D is less common.
- SHOUT – contains S, H, O, U, T – H is good, O and U are vowels.
- SWUNT – archaic, probably invalid.
- STUNS – repeats S, invalid.

The best valid candidate that fits all constraints and introduces new common letters is SHOUT:
- S in position 1 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 1 for S in earlier guesses, but never confirmed it must be elsewhere).
- H, O, U, T are new letters not yet tested.
- Pattern: S H O U T → positions: 1 2 3 4 5.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 (but earlier feedback said S is in word but not in position 1).  
  Wait, this contradicts the first feedback that S(-) in SLATE (position 1 wrong).

Therefore S cannot be in position 1.  
Re-evaluate: S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Valid words with T in 4 and S in 2, 3, or 5:
- _ S _ T _ : e.g., B S _ T _ – but B not tested.
- _ _ S T _ : e.g., C O S T _ – but 5 letters.
- _ _ _ T S : e.g., C H U T S – but not a word.

Better systematic approach: list 5-letter words ending in T?S with S not in 1 and no forbidden letters.

Examples:
- M O S T S – plural, valid.
- C O S T S – valid.
- F O S T S – valid.
- B O S T S – valid.

Among these, MOSTS is a valid English word (archaic but accepted), but COSTS is more common.

COSTS:
- C, O, S, T, S.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S appears in positions 3 and 5; position 3 is allowed (not ruled out).
- Letters C, O, S, T are all allowed (no L, A, E, R, I, P).

Remaining common letters to try: N, O, C, D, G, H, U, M, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ T _ with S somewhere and no forbidden letters:
- SNOUT (contains N, O, U, T, S) – but U is less common.
- SMOKE – contains M, O, K, E, S – E is ruled out.
- SOUND – contains O, U, N, D, S – but D is less common.
- SHOUT – contains S, H, O, U, T – H is good, O and U are vowels.
- SWUNT – archaic, probably invalid.
- STUNS – repeats S, invalid.

The best valid candidate that fits all constraints and introduces new common letters is SHOUT:
- S in position 1 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 1 for S in earlier guesses, but never confirmed it must be elsewhere).
- H, O, U, T are new letters not yet tested.
- Pattern: S H O U T → positions: 1 2 3 4 5.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 (but earlier feedback said S is in word but not in position 1).  
  Wait, this contradicts the first feedback that S(-) in SLATE (position 1 wrong).

Therefore S cannot be in position 1.  
Re-evaluate: S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Valid words with T in 4 and S in 2, 3, or 5:
- _ S _ T _ : e.g., B S _ T _ – but B not tested.
- _ _ S T _ : e.g., C O S T _ – but 5 letters.
- _ _ _ T S : e.g., C H U T S – but not a word.

Better systematic approach: list 5-letter words ending in T?S with S not in 1 and no forbidden letters.

Examples:
- M O S T S – plural, valid.
- C O S T S – valid.
- F O S T S – valid.
- B O S T S – valid.

Among these, MOSTS is a valid English word (archaic but accepted), but COSTS is more common.

COSTS:
- C, O, S, T, S.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S appears in positions 3 and 5; position 3 is allowed (not ruled out).
- Letters C, O, S, T are all allowed (no L, A, E, R, I, P).

Thus, COSTS is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these without repeating letters. 

Popular choices include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has T in position 4.
- It contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 1.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Good next steps:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Try to place S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. Use other common letters that haven't been ruled out (R, I, N, O, C, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- STRIP (good, uses S, T, R, I, P)
- SNORT (but O and R might be too many new letters)
- SNOUT (but U is less common)
- STINK (good, uses S, T, I, N, K)

I'll go with STRIP as it introduces R and I (common letters) and keeps S and T in good positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.

   - Letters L, A, E are absent.

   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - T is now marked “-” (wrong position), but we already know from round 1 that T is in position 4.  
     This feedback is contradictory unless interpreted as “T is in the word but not in position 2” (which is redundant because we already know it’s in position 4).  
     Assuming the feedback is consistent, we can safely treat T as locked in position 4.
   - R, I, P are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Must contain S (not in position 1).
- Cannot contain: L, A, E, R, I, P.

Remaining common letters to try: N, O, C, D, G, H, U, M, Y, etc.

- SHOUT – contains S, H, O, U, T – H is good, O and U are vowels.
- SWUNT – archaic, probably invalid.
- STUNS – repeats S, invalid.

The best valid candidate that fits all constraints and introduces new common letters is SHOUT:
- S in position 1 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 1 for S in earlier guesses, but never confirmed it must be elsewhere).
- H, O, U, T are new letters not yet tested.
- Pattern: S H O U T → positions: 1 2 3 4 5.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 (but earlier feedback said S is in word but not in position 1).  
  Wait, this contradicts the first feedback that S(-) in SLATE (position 1 wrong).

Therefore S cannot be in position 1.  
Re-evaluate: S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Valid words with T in 4 and S in 2, 3, or 5:
- _ S _ T _ : e.g., B S _ T _ – but B not tested.
- _ _ S T _ : e.g., C O S T _ – but 5 letters.
- _ _ _ T S : e.g., C H U T S – but not a word.

Examples:
- M O S T S – plural, valid.
- C O S T S – valid.
- F O S T S – valid.
- B O S T S – valid.

Among these, MOSTS is a valid English word (archaic but accepted), but COSTS is more common.

Let's extract every constraint from the four pieces of feedback.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - L, A, E are absent.

2. STRIP → S(-) T(-) R(x) I(x) P(x)
   - T is still “-” for position 2 (redundant because we know T is in position 4).
   - R, I, P are absent.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (again).

3. COSTS → C(x) O(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
   - T is in position 4 (✓) – consistent.
   - S appears twice: one in position 3 (marked “-”) and one in position 5 (marked “✓”).
     - Therefore the word ends in …T S.
     - The other S must be in position 2 (cannot be 1, 3, or 5).
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - C is absent.

4. HOSTS → H(-) O(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
   - T is in position 4 (✓) – consistent.
   - S appears twice: one in position 3 (marked “-”) and one in position 5 (marked “✓”).
     - Confirms the word ends in …T S and has an S in position 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (same as before).
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - All other letters from HOSTS (H, O, S, T, S) are accounted for.

Current pattern:
- Position 1: not H, not any of L/A/E/R/I/P/C.
- Position 2: must be S (only remaining place for the second S).
- Position 3: not O, not S (because one S is already in position 2 and the other in position 5), and not any of L/A/E/R/I/P/C.
- Position 4: T (fixed).
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ S _ T S, and must contain O somewhere in positions 1 or 3.

Letters still allowed for position 1: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want a common English word).

Letters still allowed for position 3: O is the only required vowel here; other consonants not yet ruled out.

Looking for common 5-letter English words matching _ S _ T S and containing O:

- BOSTS – not a valid English word.
- DOSTS – valid (Scots plural of “dost”).
- FOSTS – not standard.
- GOSTS – not standard.
- MOSTS – archaic but valid.
- NOSTS – not standard.
- PISTS – invalid (P ruled out).
- VOSTS – not standard.
- WISTS – invalid (W not ruled out, but no O).
- YOSTS – not standard.

The only reasonable common word left is MOSTS, but it’s archaic.  
However, “MOSTS” is listed in some dictionaries as the plural of “most” (chiefly Scots).  
Given the constraints, it’s the only valid candidate.

But let’s double-check:  
- M, O, S, T, S.  
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- S is in positions 2 and 5 (✓).  
- O is in position 3 (not ruled out).  
- M is allowed (never tested).  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore MOSTS is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these without repeating letters. 

Popular choices include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has T in position 4.
- It contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 1.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Good next steps:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Try to place S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. Use other common letters that haven't been ruled out (R, I, N, O, C, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- STRIP (good, uses S, T, R, I, P)
- SNORT (but O and R might be too many new letters)
- SNOUT (but U is less common)
- STINK (good, uses S, T, I, N, K)

I'll go with STRIP as it introduces R and I (common letters) and keeps S and T in good positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, E are absent.

2. STRIP → S(-) T(-) R(x) I(x) P(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - T is now marked “-” (wrong position), but we already know from round 1 that T is in position 4.  
     This feedback is contradictory unless interpreted as “T is in the word but not in position 2” (which is redundant because we already know it’s in position 4).  
     Assuming the feedback is consistent, we can safely treat T as locked in position 4.
   - R, I, P are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Must contain S (not in position 1).
- Cannot contain: L, A, E, R, I, P.

Remaining common letters to try: N, O, C, D, G, H, U, M, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ T _ with S somewhere and no forbidden letters:
- SNOUT (contains N, O, U, T, S) – but U is less common.
- SMOKE – contains M, O, K, E, S – E is ruled out.
- SOUND – contains O, U, N, D, S – but D is less common.
- SHOUT – contains S, H, O, U, T – H is good, O and U are vowels.
- SWUNT – archaic, probably invalid.
- STUNS – repeats S, invalid.

The best valid candidate that fits all constraints and introduces new common letters is SHOUT:
- S in position 1 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 1 for S in earlier guesses, but never confirmed it must be elsewhere).
- H, O, U, T are new letters not yet tested.
- Pattern: S H O U T → positions: 1 2 3 4 5.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 (but earlier feedback said S is in word but not in position 1).  
  Wait, this contradicts the first feedback that S(-) in SLATE (position 1 wrong).

Therefore S cannot be in position 1.  
Re-evaluate: S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Valid words with T in 4 and S in 2, 3, or 5:
- _ S _ T _ : e.g., B S _ T _ – but B not tested.
- _ _ S T _ : e.g., C O S T _ – but 5 letters.
- _ _ _ T S : e.g., C H U T S – but not a word.

Better systematic approach: list 5-letter words ending in T?S with S not in 1 and no forbidden letters.

Examples:
- M O S T S – plural, valid.
- C O S T S – valid.
- F O S T S – valid.
- B O S T S – valid.

Among these, MOSTS is a valid English word (archaic but accepted), but COSTS is more common.

COSTS:
- C, O, S, T, S.
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- S appears in positions 3 and 5; position 3 is allowed (not ruled out).
- Letters C, O, S, T are all allowed (no L, A, E, R, I, P).

Thus, COSTS is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, E are absent.

2. STRIP → S(-) T(-) R(x) I(x) P(x)
   - T is still marked “-” for position 2, but we already know it’s in position 4, so this is consistent.
   - R, I, P are absent.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (again).

3. COSTS → C(x) O(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
   - T is in position 4 (✓) – consistent.
   - S appears twice: once in position 3 (marked “-”) and once in position 5 (marked “✓”).
     - This means the word has two S’s, with one in position 5 (exact match) and the other S somewhere else but NOT in position 3.
     - Therefore S must be in position 2 (since position 1 is ruled out and position 3 is ruled out for the other S).
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - C is absent.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ S _ T S
- Must contain O (but not in position 2).
- Cannot contain: L, A, E, R, I, P, C.

Possible positions for O:
- Position 1 or 3 (cannot be 2 or 4 or 5 because 4 is T and 5 is S).

Letters left to try: D, G, H, N, U, M, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ S _ T S with O in 1 or 3:
- O S _ T S: but O would be in position 1, and we have no info against it.
- _ S O T S: but O would be in position 3.

Looking at English words:
- HOSTS: H, O, S, T, S – fits _ S O T S pattern.  
  - H, O, S, T are allowed.  
  - O is in position 3 (not ruled out).  
  - S is in positions 2 and 5; position 2 is allowed for S.

Check constraints:
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- S is in positions 2 and 5; position 2 is allowed (not ruled out).  
- O is in position 3 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

Let's extract every constraint from the four pieces of feedback.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - L, A, E are absent.

2. STRIP → S(-) T(-) R(x) I(x) P(x)
   - T is still “-” for position 2 (redundant because we know T is in position 4).
   - R, I, P are absent.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (again).

3. COSTS → C(x) O(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
   - T is in position 4 (✓) – consistent.
   - S appears twice: one in position 3 (marked “-”) and one in position 5 (marked “✓”).
     - Therefore the word ends in …T S.
     - The other S must be in position 2 (cannot be 1, 3, or 5).
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - C is absent.

4. HOSTS → H(-) O(-) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
   - T is in position 4 (✓) – consistent.
   - S appears twice: one in position 3 (marked “-”) and one in position 5 (marked “✓”).
     - Confirms the word ends in …T S and has an S in position 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (same as before).
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - All other letters from HOSTS (H, O, S, T, S) are accounted for.

Current pattern:
- Position 1: not H, not any of L/A/E/R/I/P/C.
- Position 2: must be S (only remaining place for the second S).
- Position 3: not O, not S (because one S is already in position 2 and the other in position 5), and not any of L/A/E/R/I/P/C.
- Position 4: T (fixed).
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ S _ T S, and must contain O somewhere in positions 1 or 3.

Letters still allowed for position 1: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want a common English word).

Letters still allowed for position 3: O is the only required vowel here; other consonants not yet ruled out.

Looking for common 5-letter English words matching _ S _ T S and containing O:

- BOSTS – not a valid English word.
- DOSTS – valid (Scots plural of “dost”).
- FOSTS – not standard.
- GOSTS – not standard.
- MOSTS – archaic but valid.
- NOSTS – not standard.
- PISTS – invalid (P ruled out).
- VOSTS – not standard.
- WISTS – invalid (W not ruled out, but no O).
- YOSTS – not standard.

The only reasonable common word left is MOSTS, but it’s archaic.  
However, “MOSTS” is listed in some dictionaries as the plural of “most” (chiefly Scots).  
Given the constraints, it’s the only valid candidate.

But let’s double-check:  
- M, O, S, T, S.  
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- S is in positions 2 and 5 (✓).  
- O is in position 3 (not ruled out).  
- M is allowed (never tested).  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore MOSTS is the logical next guess.

Consolidated facts:

- S appears twice: one in position 5 (✓), and the other must be in position 2 (because position 1 is ruled out by round 1, position 3 is ruled out by rounds 3–5, and position 5 is already taken by the second S).
- Therefore the word pattern is: _ S _ T S
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from rounds 3–5).
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, E, R, I, P, C, H, M.
- Remaining possible first letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want a common English word).
- Remaining possible third letters: must be O (since O is required but cannot be in position 2) or another consonant not yet ruled out, but O is the only vowel left to place.
