For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, high-frequency letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English
3. It forms a valid 5-letter word
4. The letters can help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).

- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- O is in the correct 4th position.
- No A, R, S, E are used.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. From AROSE:
   - O is in the word and is in the 4th position (✓).
   - A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).  
     Wait – this directly contradicts the first piece of feedback, which said O is in the 4th position (✓).  
     The only way both statements can be true is if the feedback for POINT was intended to mean that the letter O appears somewhere else in the word (not 4th position), yet the first guess already pinned O to the 4th position.  
     Therefore, the feedback for POINT must be interpreted as:  
     - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (since the 2nd letter of POINT is O).  
     - I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
     - P, N, T are NOT in the word.

So the corrected constraints are:
- Word has 5 letters.
- 4th letter is O (from AROSE).
- Does NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
- Contains I somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Contains O somewhere, but since 4th is already O, this is redundant.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known O and I.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 4th spot, containing I somewhere else (not 3rd), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- BUILT – contains U, I, L, T (T is excluded).  
- CLOUD – contains C, L, U, D, but no I.  
- DROID – contains D, R (R excluded), O, I, D.

- VIGOR – V, I, G, O, R (R excluded).  
- WIDOW – W, I, D, O, W – I is in 2nd spot (allowed), O in 4th (matches), no excluded letters.

Let's carefully re-interpret the feedback so far.

1. From AROSE:
   - A(x) – A is not in the word.
   - R(x) – R is not in the word.
   - O(✓) – O is in the word and is in position 4.
   - S(x) – S is not in the word.
   - E(x) – E is not in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P(x) – P is not in the word.
   - O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (the letter O in POINT is in position 2).
   - I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - N(x) – N is not in the word.
   - T(x) – T is not in the word.

3. From WIDOW:
   - W(x) – W is not in the word.
   - I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - D(x) – D is not in the word.
   - O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (the letter O in WIDOW is in position 4).
   - W(x) – W is not in the word.

Now we can consolidate what we know:

- The word has the form: _ _ _ O _  (because O is in position 4, from AROSE).
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, W, D.
- Letters known TO be in the word: O (position 4), I (somewhere except positions 2 or 3).
- Allowed letters for other positions: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since I must appear and cannot be in positions 2 or 3, it must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
1. I _ _ O _
2. _ _ _ O I

Let's think of common 5-letter words fitting these patterns with the allowed letters.

For pattern 1 (I _ _ O _):
- I B U O _ – no common word.
- I C H O _ – ""ICHO"" is not a word.
- I L M O _ – ""ILMO"" is not a word.
- I L K O _ – ""ILKO"" is not a word.
- I M B O _ – ""IMBO"" is not a word.
- I L V O _ – ""ILVO"" is not a word.

For pattern 2 (_ _ _ O I):
- B U I O I – not valid.
- C H U O I – not valid.
- L U M O I – not valid.
- M U L O I – not valid.
- G L O O I – not valid.
- F L O O I – not valid.
- V I O L I – not valid.
- L I V O I – not valid.
- B I L O I – not valid.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must have O in position 4 and I somewhere else (positions 1 or 5 only), and use allowed letters.

Looking for words like:
- _ _ _ O I (I at position 5)
  - C L O C I – not valid.
  - M U L O I – not valid.
  - L U C O I – not valid.
  - B U L O I – not valid.
  - G U L O I – not valid.

- I _ _ O _ (I at position 1)
  - I L M O _ – not valid.
  - I L V O _ – not valid.
  - I L K O _ – not valid.
  - I L B O _ – not valid.

Hmm, let's try ""CLOVI"" – but that's not a common word.
""ULCIO"" – not valid.
""VOCIO"" – not valid.
""JULIO"" – but J is allowed, U, L, I, O.
""JULIO"" is a valid word (Spanish for July, but also used in English names).

Checking if ""JULIO"" fits:
- J: allowed (not excluded)
- U: allowed
- L: allowed
- I: must be in word, and here it's in position 4, but position 4 is O. Wait no, ""JULIO"" is J U L I O, so positions:
  1: J
  2: U
  3: L
  4: I – but position 4 must be O. So this doesn't fit.

Let's try ""BUIOC"" – not valid.
""FUOCI"" – not valid.
""KULIO"" – not valid.

Wait, let's think systematically. The word must be _ _ _ O _ with I in position 1 or 5, and no excluded letters.

Possible words:
- I _ _ O _:
  - I L M O _ – no.
  - I L V O _ – no.
  - I L K O _ – no.
  - I L B O _ – no.
  - I L F O _ – no.
  - I L G O _ – no.
  - I L H O _ – no.
  - I L C O _ – no.
  - I L Y O _ – no.
  - I L Z O _ – no.
  - I L Q O _ – no.
  - I L M O _ – no.

- _ _ _ O I:
  - B U M O I – not valid.
  - C H U O I – not valid.
  - L U M O I – not valid.
  - M U L O I – not valid.
  - G U L O I – not valid.
  - F U L O I – not valid.
  - V U L O I – not valid.
  - B U L O I – not valid.
  - C U L O I – not valid.
  - L U C O I – not valid.

This seems difficult. Let's try ""ULCIO"" – not valid.
""VOCIO"" – not valid.
""JULIO"" – already saw position 4 is I, but must be O.

Wait, let's try ""CLOVI"" – not valid.
""ULCIO"" – not valid.
""FUOCI"" – not valid.
""KULIO"" – not valid.

Let me think of common words ending with O and containing I not in positions 2 or 3.

Looking at _ _ _ O I:
- ""MUCIO"" – not valid.
- ""BUCIO"" – not valid.
- ""LUCIO"" – valid (a name, but also used in English for a type of fish or bird).
- ""LUCIO"" is 5 letters: L U C I O – positions:
  1: L
  2: U
  3: C
  4: I – but position 4 must be O. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, the word must be _ _ _ O _ with I in position 1 or 5.

Let's try ""CLOVI"" – not valid.
""ULCIO"" – not valid.
""VOCIO"" – not valid.
""JULIO"" – doesn't fit.

Let me try ""CLOVI"" – not valid.
""ULCIO"" – not valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, high-frequency letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English
3. It forms a valid 5-letter word
4. The letters can help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Has O as its 4th letter: _ _ _ O _
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 4th position.
2. Uses none of A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these while keeping O in the 4th spot. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- O is in the correct 4th position.
- No A, R, S, E are used.

This should help us identify or eliminate several more letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. From AROSE:
   - O is in the word and is in the 4th position (✓).
   - A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).  
     Wait – this directly contradicts the first piece of feedback, which said O is in the 4th position (✓).  
     The only way both statements can be true is if the feedback for POINT was intended to mean that the letter O appears somewhere else in the word (not 4th position), yet the first guess already pinned O to the 4th position.  
     Therefore, the feedback for POINT must be interpreted as:  
     - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (since the 2nd letter of POINT is O).  
     - I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
     - P, N, T are NOT in the word.

So the corrected constraints are:
- Word has 5 letters.
- 4th letter is O (from AROSE).
- Does NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
- Contains I somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Contains O somewhere, but since 4th is already O, this is redundant.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known O and I.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 4th spot, containing I somewhere else (not 3rd), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- BUILT – contains U, I, L, T (T is excluded).  
- CLOUD – contains C, L, U, D, but no I.  
- DROID – contains D, R (R excluded), O, I, D.  
- GUILD – G, U, I, L, D – all allowed, and I is in 3rd spot (excluded).  
- MOUND – M, O, U, N (N excluded), D.  
- VIGOR – V, I, G, O, R (R excluded).  
- WIDOW – W, I, D, O, W – I is in 2nd spot (allowed), O in 4th (matches), no excluded letters.

""WIDOW"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: W, I, D, O, W.
- O is in 4th position (✓ from AROSE).
- I is in 2nd position (not 3rd, so allowed).
- No A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
- All letters are allowed.

Let’s re-express the feedback in clear constraints.

1. From AROSE:
   - 4th letter is O (✓).
   - A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
     (This is compatible with O being in 4th position.)
   - I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).

3. From WIDOW:
   - W is NOT in the word (x).
   - I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
   - D is NOT in the word (x).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

The last point from WIDOW is critical: it says O is NOT in the 4th position, which directly contradicts the first guess (AROSE) where O was marked ✓ in the 4th position. This contradiction implies the feedback for WIDOW must be interpreted differently. The most plausible resolution is that the feedback symbols were swapped for the letters in WIDOW. That is:

W(x) – W not in word  
I(-) – I is in word, NOT in 2nd position  
D(x) – D not in word  
O(-) – O is in word, NOT in 4th position  
W(x) – W not in word  

Given this reinterpretation, the constraints are:

- 4th letter is O (from AROSE).  
- I is in the word, NOT in 2nd or 3rd positions → I must be in 1st or 5th.  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, W, D.  
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, O (O is already placed).  

We need a 5-letter word with O in 4th position, I in 1st or 5th, and using only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- I _ _ O _ (I in 1st): I is already used, so remaining letters must be from allowed set.  
  Example: I B O U L – but we need 5 letters with O in 4th.  
- _ _ _ O I (I in 5th):  
  Example: B U O M I – but O is 4th, I is 5th.  
  Check letters: B, U, M, I – all allowed.  

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BOUMI"" (though not common), but a better choice is ""FOULI"" – but ""FOULI"" isn't valid.  

A real word: ""CLOVI"" – invalid.  
""MOXIE"" – contains X, I, O, but E is excluded.  

Real word: ""COBIA"" – contains A (excluded).  

Another approach: list 5-letter words with O in 4th and I in 5th, avoiding excluded letters.  
Example: ""BOGUS"" – S excluded.  
""COMFY"" – F, Y allowed.  

""COMFY"" has O in 4th and I is not present, so invalid.  

""BOOMI"" – O in 4th, I in 5th, letters B, O, M, I – all allowed.  

""BOOMI"" is a valid English word (a type of plant).  

Thus, the next guess is ""BOOMI"".

   - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
     (This is compatible with O being in 4th position.)
   - I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).

3. From WIDOW:
   - W is NOT in the word (x).
   - I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
   - D is NOT in the word (x).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

The last point from WIDOW is critical: it says O is NOT in the 4th position, which directly contradicts the first guess (AROSE) where O was marked ✓ in the 4th position. This contradiction implies the feedback for WIDOW must be interpreted differently. The most plausible resolution is that the feedback symbols were swapped for the letters in WIDOW. That is:

W(x) – W not in word  
I(-) – I is in word, NOT in 2nd position  
D(x) – D not in word  
O(-) – O is in word, NOT in 4th position  
W(x) – W not in word  

Given this reinterpretation, the constraints are:

- 4th letter is O (from AROSE).  
- I is in the word, NOT in 2nd or 3rd positions → I must be in 1st or 5th.  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, W, D.  
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, O (O is already placed).  

We need a 5-letter word with O in 4th position, I in 1st or 5th, and using only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- I _ _ O _ (I in 1st): I is already used, so remaining letters must be from allowed set.  
  Example: I B O U L – but we need 5 letters with O in 4th.  
- _ _ _ O I (I in 5th):  
  Example: B U O M I – but O is 4th, I is 5th.  
  Check letters: B, U, M, I – all allowed.  

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BOUMI"" (though not common), but a better choice is ""FOULI"" – but ""FOULI"" isn't valid.  

A real word: ""CLOVI"" – invalid.  
""MOXIE"" – contains X, I, O, but E is excluded.  

Real word: ""COBIA"" – contains A (excluded).  

Another approach: list 5-letter words with O in 4th and I in 5th, avoiding excluded letters.  
Example: ""BOGUS"" – S excluded.  
""COMFY"" – F, Y allowed.  

""COMFY"" has O in 4th and I is not present, so invalid.  

""BOOMI"" – O in 4th, I in 5th, letters B, O, M, I – all allowed.  

""BOOMI"" is a valid English word (a type of plant).  

Thus, the next guess is ""BOOMI"".",Guess 5: BOOMI -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(-) O(✓) M(x) I(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, high-frequency letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English
3. It forms a valid 5-letter word
4. The letters can help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Has O as its 4th letter: _ _ _ O _
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 4th position.
2. Uses none of A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these while keeping O in the 4th spot. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- O is in the correct 4th position.
- No A, R, S, E are used.

This should help us identify or eliminate several more letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. From AROSE:
   - O is in the word and is in the 4th position (✓).
   - A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).  
     Wait – this directly contradicts the first piece of feedback, which said O is in the 4th position (✓).  
     The only way both statements can be true is if the feedback for POINT was intended to mean that the letter O appears somewhere else in the word (not 4th position), yet the first guess already pinned O to the 4th position.  
     Therefore, the feedback for POINT must be interpreted as:  
     - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (since the 2nd letter of POINT is O).  
     - I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
     - P, N, T are NOT in the word.

So the corrected constraints are:
- Word has 5 letters.
- 4th letter is O (from AROSE).
- Does NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
- Contains I somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Contains O somewhere, but since 4th is already O, this is redundant.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known O and I.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 4th spot, containing I somewhere else (not 3rd), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- BUILT – contains U, I, L, T (T is excluded).  
- CLOUD – contains C, L, U, D, but no I.  
- DROID – contains D, R (R excluded), O, I, D.  
- GUILD – G, U, I, L, D – all allowed, and I is in 3rd spot (excluded).  
- MOUND – M, O, U, N (N excluded), D.  
- VIGOR – V, I, G, O, R (R excluded).  
- WIDOW – W, I, D, O, W – I is in 2nd spot (allowed), O in 4th (matches), no excluded letters.

""WIDOW"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: W, I, D, O, W.
- O is in 4th position (✓ from AROSE).
- I is in 2nd position (not 3rd, so allowed).
- No A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
- All letters are allowed.

Let’s re-express the feedback in clear constraints.

1. From AROSE:
   - 4th letter is O (✓).
   - A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).

   - I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
   - D is NOT in the word (x).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

The last point from WIDOW is critical: it says O is NOT in the 4th position, which directly contradicts the first guess (AROSE) where O was marked ✓ in the 4th position.

Let’s list all the constraints we now have:

1. From AROSE:
   - 4th letter is O (✓).
   - A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. From POINT:
   - P, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).

3. From WIDOW:
   - W, D are NOT in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-)  
     (This contradicts AROSE, so we must reinterpret: the feedback likely means O is NOT in the 4th position, i.e., the ✓ from AROSE was actually for the 3rd position, and the 4th position is now marked (-). This seems unlikely; more plausibly, the feedback symbols were swapped, and the correct interpretation is O is in the 4th position, I is in the word but not in 2nd or 3rd, etc.)

4. From BOOMI:
   - B, M are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-) – again, if 4th is ✓, this is compatible.
   - I is in the word and is in the 5th position (✓).

So combining:
- 4th letter is O (✓ from AROSE).
- I is in the 5th position (✓ from BOOMI).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, W, D, B, M.
- Allowed letters: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, O (O already placed).
