### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S entirely.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since E is already fixed in position 5).

A strong next probe would use common remaining letters.  
The word “UNTIE” is invalid (contains U and I but also N and T, and ends in E).  
“ELITE” uses L, I, T, E – all allowed.  
“UNTIE” has U, N, T, I, E – also allowed.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (from AROSE).
2. E is NOT in position 1 (from ELITE).
3. L is in the word but not in position 2 (from ELITE).
4. I and T are NOT in the word (from ELITE).
5. A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (from AROSE).

So far the forbidden letters are: A, R, O, S, I, T.

The remaining alphabet includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- does not contain A, R, O, S, I, T
- has E only in position 5
- has L somewhere except position 2

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- ""BLEED"" – but contains D and second E is in position 4, which is invalid (must be only one E in position 5).
- ""CUBED"" – contains D and second E is in position 4, invalid.
- ""FLUME"" – contains F, L, U, M, E. This looks valid: ends in E, no forbidden letters, L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). So invalid.
- ""PLUME"" – same issue, L is in position 2.
- ""GULCH"" – ends in H, invalid.
- ""MULED"" – ends in D, invalid.
- ""WOKEN"" – contains K and N, but ends in N, invalid.
- ""BUMPY"" – ends in Y, invalid.
- ""FLECK"" – ends in K, invalid.
- ""BENCH"" – ends in H, invalid.
- ""PENCE"" – ends in E, but contains N and C, and E is in position 5. L is not present, but we know L is in the word. So invalid.
- ""LUNGE"" – contains L, U, N, G, E. E is in position 5, no forbidden letters, L is in position 1 (which is allowed since feedback only said L is not in position 2). This seems valid.

""LUNGE"" fits all constraints:
- Ends in E (position 5)
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, I, T

From the three rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

2. ELITE → E(-) L(-) I(x) T(x) E(✓)

3. LUNGE → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ L is not in position 1, U,N,G are absent, and E is confirmed in position 5.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, T, U, N, G.

Remaining usable letters (besides E in position 5):  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L (which must appear somewhere).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- contains L exactly once, not in positions 1 or 2.
- uses only letters not in the forbidden set.

Possible positions for L: 3 or 4.

Let’s list candidate words:
- _ _ L _ E  
  – “BLECH” – invalid (C and H are allowed, but “BLECH” is uncommon and contains C,H which are allowed, but let’s check others).  
  – “CLEAN” – invalid (A,N forbidden).  
  – “FLECK” – C,K allowed, but K is allowed, word is valid.  
    However, L is in position 2 here, which is forbidden (from ELITE feedback).  
- _ _ _ L E  
  – “BLOWE” – O forbidden.  
  – “DWELLE” – double E, invalid.  
  – “FLELE” – invalid.  
  – “HUMLE” – U forbidden.  
  – “MULEE” – U forbidden.  
  – “PLEBE” – B,E allowed, but P,L,E,B,E – double E, invalid.  
  – “WHELP” – ends in H, invalid.  
  – “YODEL” – ends in L, invalid.

Another approach: look for words with L in position 3 or 4, ending in E, using allowed letters.

Let’s try:
- _ _ L _ E  
  – “BLECH” – B,L,E,C,H – all allowed letters, L in position 2 is NOT allowed (from ELITE).  
  – “FLECK” – L in position 2, forbidden.  
  – “PLEBE” – L in position 3, allowed.  
    But P,L,E,B,E – double E, invalid.  
  – “BLEED” – double E, invalid.  
  – “BELLE” – double E, invalid.  

- _ _ _ L E  
  – “BLOWE” – O forbidden.  
  – “DWELLE” – double E.  
  – “FLELE” – invalid.  
  – “MULEE” – U forbidden.  
  – “YODEL” – ends in L, invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list valid patterns:

Pattern 1: _ _ L _ E  
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, L (L must appear once).  
We need two consonants before L, and one after.  
Possible:  
- B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z for the first two positions.  
- For the fourth position, same set minus L.  

Example:  
- B, L, E, C, H – but that’s “BLECH” (L in position 2, forbidden).  
- C, L, E, F, K – “CLEFK” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, K – “FLEBK” – not a word.  

Pattern 2: _ _ _ L E  
Letters: same set.  
Need three consonants before L.  
Example:  
- B, L, E, D, W – “BLEDW” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, W, D – “FLEWD” – ends in D, invalid.  
- M, U, L, E, D – U forbidden.  
- P, L, E, W, D – “PLEWD” – not a word.  
- W, H, E, L, E – “WHELE” – not standard.  

Pattern 3: _ L _ _ E – L in position 2 is forbidden (from ELITE).  
So skip.

Pattern 4: L _ _ _ E – L in position 1 is forbidden (from LUNGE feedback).  
So skip.

Thus, the only viable pattern left is _ _ L _ E with L in position 3, but we must ensure letters are allowed and word is valid.

Valid word fitting:  
- “BLEED” – double E, invalid.  
- “BLECH” – L in position 2, forbidden.  
- “BLEW” – ends in W, invalid.  
- “BLEBS” – S forbidden.  
- “BLEBS” – invalid.  

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L and E.

We need a word ending in E, with L in position 3 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in E with L in position 3 or 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

- “BLEED” – double E.  
- “BLECH” – L in position 2.  
- “BLEW” – ends in W.  
- “FLECK” – L in position 2.  
- “PLEBE” – double E.  
- “YODEL” – ends in L.  

Wait, let’s try “DWELLE” – but double E.  

Another systematic check:  
Possible letters for positions 1,2,4: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to form a word ending in E, with L in position 3 or 4, and no other forbidden letters.

Let’s try:  
- B, L, E, D, E – “BLEDE” – not a word.  
- C, L, E, F, E – “CLEFE” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, B, E – “DLEBE” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, E – “FLEBE” – not a word.  
- H, L, E, D, E – “HLEDE” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, D, E – “MLEDE” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, B, E – “PLEBE” – double E.  
- V, L, E, D, E – “VLEDE” – not a word.  

Hmm, seems scarce. Let me try L in position 4:  
- _ _ _ L E  
Example:  
- B, L, E, D, E – “BLEDE” – not a word.  
- C, L, E, F, E – “CLEFE” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, B, E – “DLEBE” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, E – “FLEBE” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, D, E – “MLEDE” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, B, E – “PLEBE” – double E.  

Another approach: look for real words.  
“BLEED” – double E.  
“BLECH” – L in position 2.  
“BLEW” – ends in W.  
“FLECK” – L in position 2.  
“PLEBE” – double E.  
“YODEL” – ends in L.  

It appears most words with L in position 3 have double E or are uncommon.  
Let me try “BLEED” – but double E.  

Wait, let’s try “DWELLE” – but double E.  

Another check: “DWELT” – ends in T, forbidden.  

Realizing the scarcity, let’s try “BLEED” – but double E.  

Actually, let’s try “BELLE” – double E.  

Let me try “FLECK” – L in position 2, forbidden.  

Seems stuck. Let me try “DWELLE” – double E.  

Another systematic word list ending in E, avoiding forbidden letters:  
- B, L, E, E, D – “BLEED” – double E.  
- C, L, E, E, D – “CLEED” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, E, B – “DLEEB” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, E, D – “FLEED” – double E.  
- H, L, E, E, D – “HLEED” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, E, D – “MLEED” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, E, D – “PLEED” – not a word.  
- V, L, E, E, D – “VLEED” – not a word.  

Thus, the only common word with L in position 3 is “BLEED”, but it has double E.  

However, the feedback only forbids A,R,O,S,I,T,U,N,G.  
Double E is allowed since E is confirmed in position 5.  

But “BLEED” has E in position 4 and 5, but our feedback only confirms E in position 5, so E in position 4 is allowed?  
Actually, the feedback only tells us E is in position 5, it doesn’t say anything about other E’s.  

So “BLEED” is a valid candidate:  
- Ends in E (position 5).  
- Contains L in position 3 (not 1 or 2).  
- Uses only allowed letters B,L,E,D.  

Let’s check:  
B – allowed  
L – must appear, allowed  
E – allowed in position 5, and position 4 E is not forbidden.  
D – allowed.  

Thus, “BLEED” fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S entirely.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since E is already fixed in position 5).

A strong next probe would use common remaining letters.  
The word “UNTIE” is invalid (contains U and I but also N and T, and ends in E).  
“ELITE” uses L, I, T, E – all allowed.  
“UNTIE” has U, N, T, I, E – also allowed.  
Between these, “ELITE” uses more high-frequency letters (L, I, T).

So I’ll go with ELITE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (from AROSE).
2. E is NOT in position 1 (from ELITE).
3. L is in the word but not in position 2 (from ELITE).
4. I and T are NOT in the word (from ELITE).
5. A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (from AROSE).

So far the forbidden letters are: A, R, O, S, I, T.

The remaining alphabet includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- does not contain A, R, O, S, I, T
- has E only in position 5
- has L somewhere except position 2

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- ""BLEED"" – but contains D and second E is in position 4, which is invalid (must be only one E in position 5).
- ""CUBED"" – contains D and second E is in position 4, invalid.
- ""FLUME"" – contains F, L, U, M, E. This looks valid: ends in E, no forbidden letters, L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). So invalid.
- ""PLUME"" – same issue, L is in position 2.
- ""GULCH"" – ends in H, invalid.
- ""MULED"" – ends in D, invalid.
- ""WOKEN"" – contains K and N, but ends in N, invalid.
- ""BUMPY"" – ends in Y, invalid.
- ""FLECK"" – ends in K, invalid.
- ""BENCH"" – ends in H, invalid.
- ""PENCE"" – ends in E, but contains N and C, and E is in position 5. L is not present, but we know L is in the word. So invalid.
- ""LUNGE"" – contains L, U, N, G, E. E is in position 5, no forbidden letters, L is in position 1 (which is allowed since feedback only said L is not in position 2). This seems valid.

""LUNGE"" fits all constraints:
- Ends in E (position 5)
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, I, T
- Contains L in position 1 (not position 2)
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like the best next guess.

From the three rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E is in position 5 and no A,R,O,S appear.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(-) I(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E is not in position 1, L is in the word but not in position 2, and I,T are absent.

3. LUNGE → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ L is not in position 1, U,N,G are absent, and E is confirmed in position 5.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, T, U, N, G.

Remaining usable letters (besides E in position 5):  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L (which must appear somewhere).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- contains L exactly once, not in positions 1 or 2.
- uses only letters not in the forbidden set.

Possible positions for L: 3 or 4.

Let’s list candidate words:
- _ _ L _ E  
  – “BLECH” – invalid (C and H are allowed, but “BLECH” is uncommon and contains C,H which are allowed, but let’s check others).  
  – “CLEAN” – invalid (A,N forbidden).  
  – “FLECK” – C,K allowed, but K is allowed, word is valid.  
    However, L is in position 2 here, which is forbidden (from ELITE feedback).  
- _ _ _ L E  
  – “BLOWE” – O forbidden.  
  – “DWELLE” – double E, invalid.  
  – “FLELE” – invalid.  
  – “HUMLE” – U forbidden.  
  – “MULEE” – U forbidden.  
  – “PLEBE” – B,E allowed, but P,L,E,B,E – double E, invalid.  
  – “WHELP” – ends in H, invalid.  
  – “YODEL” – ends in L, invalid.

Another approach: look for words with L in position 3 or 4, ending in E, using allowed letters.

Let’s try:
- _ _ L _ E  
  – “BLECH” – B,L,E,C,H – all allowed letters, L in position 2 is NOT allowed (from ELITE).  
  – “FLECK” – L in position 2, forbidden.  
  – “PLEBE” – L in position 3, allowed.  
    But P,L,E,B,E – double E, invalid.  
  – “BLEED” – double E, invalid.  
  – “BELLE” – double E, invalid.  

- _ _ _ L E  
  – “BLOWE” – O forbidden.  
  – “DWELLE” – double E.  
  – “FLELE” – invalid.  
  – “MULEE” – U forbidden.  
  – “YODEL” – ends in L, invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list valid patterns:

Pattern 1: _ _ L _ E  
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, L (L must appear once).  
We need two consonants before L, and one after.  
Possible:  
- B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z for the first two positions.  
- For the fourth position, same set minus L.  

Example:  
- B, L, E, C, H – but that’s “BLECH” (L in position 2, forbidden).  
- C, L, E, F, K – “CLEFK” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, K – “FLEBK” – not a word.  

Pattern 2: _ _ _ L E  
Letters: same set.  
Need three consonants before L.  
Example:  
- B, L, E, D, W – “BLEDW” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, W, D – “FLEWD” – ends in D, invalid.  
- M, U, L, E, D – U forbidden.  
- P, L, E, W, D – “PLEWD” – not a word.  
- W, H, E, L, E – “WHELE” – not standard.  

Pattern 3: _ L _ _ E – L in position 2 is forbidden (from ELITE).  
So skip.

Pattern 4: L _ _ _ E – L in position 1 is forbidden (from LUNGE feedback).  
So skip.

Thus, the only viable pattern left is _ _ L _ E with L in position 3, but we must ensure letters are allowed and word is valid.

Valid word fitting:  
- “BLEED” – double E, invalid.  
- “BLECH” – L in position 2, forbidden.  
- “BLEW” – ends in W, invalid.  
- “BLEBS” – S forbidden.  
- “BLEBS” – invalid.  

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L and E.

We need a word ending in E, with L in position 3 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in E with L in position 3 or 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

- “BLEED” – double E.  
- “BLECH” – L in position 2.  
- “BLEW” – ends in W.  
- “FLECK” – L in position 2.  
- “PLEBE” – double E.  
- “YODEL” – ends in L.  

Wait, let’s try “DWELLE” – but double E.  

Another systematic check:  
Possible letters for positions 1,2,4: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to form a word ending in E, with L in position 3 or 4, and no other forbidden letters.

Let’s try:  
- B, L, E, D, E – “BLEDE” – not a word.  
- C, L, E, F, E – “CLEFE” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, B, E – “DLEBE” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, E – “FLEBE” – not a word.  
- H, L, E, D, E – “HLEDE” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, D, E – “MLEDE” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, B, E – “PLEBE” – double E.  
- V, L, E, D, E – “VLEDE” – not a word.  

Hmm, seems scarce. Let me try L in position 4:  
- _ _ _ L E  
Example:  
- B, L, E, D, E – “BLEDE” – not a word.  
- C, L, E, F, E – “CLEFE” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, B, E – “DLEBE” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, E – “FLEBE” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, D, E – “MLEDE” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, B, E – “PLEBE” – double E.  

Another approach: look for real words.  
“BLEED” – double E.  
“BLECH” – L in position 2.  
“BLEW” – ends in W.  
“FLECK” – L in position 2.  
“PLEBE” – double E.  
“YODEL” – ends in L.  

It appears most words with L in position 3 have double E or are uncommon.  
Let me try “BLEED” – but double E.  

Wait, let’s try “DWELLE” – but double E.  

Another check: “DWELT” – ends in T, forbidden.  

Realizing the scarcity, let’s try “BLEED” – but double E.  

Actually, let’s try “BELLE” – double E.  

Let me try “FLECK” – L in position 2, forbidden.  

Seems stuck. Let me try “DWELLE” – double E.  

Another systematic word list ending in E, avoiding forbidden letters:  
- B, L, E, E, D – “BLEED” – double E.  
- C, L, E, E, D – “CLEED” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, E, B – “DLEEB” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, E, D – “FLEED” – double E.  
- H, L, E, E, D – “HLEED” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, E, D – “MLEED” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, E, D – “PLEED” – not a word.  
- V, L, E, E, D – “VLEED” – not a word.  

Thus, the only common word with L in position 3 is “BLEED”, but it has double E.  

However, the feedback only forbids A,R,O,S,I,T,U,N,G.  
Double E is allowed since E is confirmed in position 5.  

But “BLEED” has E in position 4 and 5, but our feedback only confirms E in position 5, so E in position 4 is allowed?  
Actually, the feedback only tells us E is in position 5, it doesn’t say anything about other E’s.  

So “BLEED” is a valid candidate:  
- Ends in E (position 5).  
- Contains L in position 3 (not 1 or 2).  
- Uses only allowed letters B,L,E,D.  

Let’s check:  
B – allowed  
L – must appear, allowed  
E – allowed in position 5, and position 4 E is not forbidden.  
D – allowed.  

Thus, “BLEED” fits all constraints.

   ⇒ L not in position 1, U,N,G absent.

4. BLEED → B(x) L(-) E(-) E(-) D(x)  
   ⇒ B and D are absent, L is not in position 2 (already known), and the two E’s are both marked “-” meaning E is not in positions 1,2,3,4 (only confirmed in position 5). This is consistent.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, T, U, N, G, B, D.

Remaining usable consonants: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L (which must appear once) and E (fixed in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- contains L exactly once, not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from BLEED feedback).  
- therefore L must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ L E

We must use only allowed letters for positions 1,2,3: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list valid words fitting _ _ _ L E with those letters:

- C, H, E, L, E → CHELE – not standard.  
- C, O, L, E – but O is forbidden.  
- F, L, E, E – but F is allowed, but word must be _ _ _ L E.  
- C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
- C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (rare).  
- F, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
- H, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
- P, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
- V, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
- W, H, E, L, E – WHELE – not standard.  
- C, H, U, L, E – U forbidden.  
- C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  

Actually, the only common word fitting _ _ _ L E with allowed letters is:

C, H, E, L, E – but CHELE is uncommon.  
Another check: C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  

Wait, let me systematically list:

Possible consonants for positions 1,2,3: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word of the form _ _ _ L E.

Looking up, the only common word is:

C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (not standard).  
F, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
H, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
M, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
P, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
V, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
W, H, E, L, E – WHELE (not standard).  

Another systematic check: _ _ _ L E with allowed letters.

Let’s try:

C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (valid but rare).  
C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
F, L, E, C, E – not a word.  
H, L, E, C, E – not a word.  
J, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
K, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
M, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
P, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
V, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
W, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
X, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
Y, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
Z, L, E, F, E – not a word.  

The only valid word seems to be CHELE, but it’s uncommon.  
However, the rules don’t require common words, just valid English.

Thus, the correct next guess is CHELE.

But let me double-check:  
Is there another word?  
C, H, E, L, E – CHELE  
C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
F, L, E, C, E – not a word.  

Yes, CHELE appears to be the only valid word fitting the constraints.

But wait, let me think again.  
Actually, the word “CHELE” is valid but uncommon.  
Another possibility is “FLECE” – but F,L,E,C,E – L is in position 3, which is forbidden (from BLEED feedback L is not in position 3).  

Thus, the only valid word fitting _ _ _ L E with L in position 4 is CHELE.

However, let me re-examine:  
The pattern is _ _ _ L E, and L must be in position 4.  
The only valid English word with L in position 4 and E in position 5, using allowed letters, is:

C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (valid but rare).  
Another check:  
C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
H, L, E, C, E – not a word.  

Thus, the correct next guess is CHELE.

But let me verify with another systematic approach:  
List all 5-letter words ending in LE, then filter by allowed letters.

Common words ending in LE:
- CHIDE – I forbidden.  
- CLEFS – S forbidden.  
- CLEW – too short.  
- CLOVE – O forbidden.  
- COBLE – O,B forbidden.  
- DOLLE – D forbidden.  
- FLECK – K allowed, but L is in position 3, forbidden (from BLEED feedback L is not in position 3).

From this exhaustive check, the only valid word fitting _ _ _ L E with allowed letters is CHELE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down future guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S entirely.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since E is already fixed in position 5).

A strong next probe would use common remaining letters.  
The word “UNTIE” is invalid (contains U and I but also N and T, and ends in E).  
“ELITE” uses L, I, T, E – all allowed.  
“UNTIE” has U, N, T, I, E – also allowed.  
Between these, “ELITE” uses more high-frequency letters (L, I, T).

So I’ll go with ELITE.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (from AROSE).
2. E is NOT in position 1 (from ELITE).
3. L is in the word but not in position 2 (from ELITE).
4. I and T are NOT in the word (from ELITE).
5. A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (from AROSE).

So far the forbidden letters are: A, R, O, S, I, T.

The remaining alphabet includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- does not contain A, R, O, S, I, T
- has E only in position 5
- has L somewhere except position 2

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- ""BLEED"" – but contains D and second E is in position 4, which is invalid (must be only one E in position 5).
- ""CUBED"" – contains D and second E is in position 4, invalid.
- ""FLUME"" – contains F, L, U, M, E. This looks valid: ends in E, no forbidden letters, L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). So invalid.
- ""PLUME"" – same issue, L is in position 2.
- ""GULCH"" – ends in H, invalid.
- ""MULED"" – ends in D, invalid.
- ""WOKEN"" – contains K and N, but ends in N, invalid.
- ""BUMPY"" – ends in Y, invalid.
- ""FLECK"" – ends in K, invalid.
- ""BENCH"" – ends in H, invalid.
- ""PENCE"" – ends in E, but contains N and C, and E is in position 5. L is not present, but we know L is in the word. So invalid.
- ""LUNGE"" – contains L, U, N, G, E. E is in position 5, no forbidden letters, L is in position 1 (which is allowed since feedback only said L is not in position 2). This seems valid.

""LUNGE"" fits all constraints:
- Ends in E (position 5)
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, I, T
- Contains L in position 1 (not position 2)
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like the best next guess.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(-) I(x) T(x) E(✓)

3. LUNGE → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ L is not in position 1, U,N,G are absent, and E is confirmed in position 5.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, T, U, N, G.

Remaining usable letters (besides E in position 5):  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L (which must appear somewhere).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- contains L exactly once, not in positions 1 or 2.
- uses only letters not in the forbidden set.

Possible positions for L: 3 or 4.

Let’s list candidate words:
- _ _ L _ E  
  – “BLECH” – invalid (C and H are allowed, but “BLECH” is uncommon and contains C,H which are allowed, but let’s check others).  
  – “CLEAN” – invalid (A,N forbidden).  
  – “FLECK” – C,K allowed, but K is allowed, word is valid.  
    However, L is in position 2 here, which is forbidden (from ELITE feedback).  
- _ _ _ L E  
  – “BLOWE” – O forbidden.  
  – “DWELLE” – double E, invalid.  
  – “FLELE” – invalid.  
  – “HUMLE” – U forbidden.  
  – “MULEE” – U forbidden.  
  – “PLEBE” – B,E allowed, but P,L,E,B,E – double E, invalid.  
  – “WHELP” – ends in H, invalid.  
  – “YODEL” – ends in L, invalid.

Another approach: look for words with L in position 3 or 4, ending in E, using allowed letters.

Let’s try:
- _ _ L _ E  
  – “BLECH” – B,L,E,C,H – all allowed letters, L in position 2 is NOT allowed (from ELITE).  
  – “FLECK” – L in position 2, forbidden.  
  – “PLEBE” – L in position 3, allowed.  
    But P,L,E,B,E – double E, invalid.  
  – “BLEED” – double E, invalid.  
  – “BELLE” – double E, invalid.  

- _ _ _ L E  
  – “BLOWE” – O forbidden.  
  – “DWELLE” – double E.  
  – “FLELE” – invalid.  
  – “MULEE” – U forbidden.  
  – “YODEL” – ends in L, invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list valid patterns:

Pattern 1: _ _ L _ E  
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, L (L must appear once).  
We need two consonants before L, and one after.  
Possible:  
- B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z for the first two positions.  
- For the fourth position, same set minus L.  

Example:  
- B, L, E, C, H – but that’s “BLECH” (L in position 2, forbidden).  
- C, L, E, F, K – “CLEFK” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, K – “FLEBK” – not a word.  

Pattern 2: _ _ _ L E  
Letters: same set.  
Need three consonants before L.  
Example:  
- B, L, E, D, W – “BLEDW” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, W, D – “FLEWD” – ends in D, invalid.  
- M, U, L, E, D – U forbidden.  
- P, L, E, W, D – “PLEWD” – not a word.  
- W, H, E, L, E – “WHELE” – not standard.  

Pattern 3: _ L _ _ E – L in position 2 is forbidden (from ELITE).  
So skip.

Pattern 4: L _ _ _ E – L in position 1 is forbidden (from LUNGE feedback).  
So skip.

Thus, the only viable pattern left is _ _ L _ E with L in position 3, but we must ensure letters are allowed and word is valid.

Valid word fitting:  
- “BLEED” – double E, invalid.  
- “BLECH” – L in position 2, forbidden.  
- “BLEW” – ends in W, invalid.  
- “BLEBS” – S forbidden.  
- “BLEBS” – invalid.  

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L and E.

We need a word ending in E, with L in position 3 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in E with L in position 3 or 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

- “BLEED” – double E.  
- “BLECH” – L in position 2.  
- “BLEW” – ends in W.  
- “FLECK” – L in position 2.  
- “PLEBE” – double E.  
- “YODEL” – ends in L.  

Wait, let’s try “DWELLE” – but double E.  

Another systematic check:  
Possible letters for positions 1,2,4: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to form a word ending in E, with L in position 3 or 4, and no other forbidden letters.

Let’s try:  
- B, L, E, D, E – “BLEDE” – not a word.  
- C, L, E, F, E – “CLEFE” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, B, E – “DLEBE” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, E – “FLEBE” – not a word.  
- H, L, E, D, E – “HLEDE” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, D, E – “MLEDE” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, B, E – “PLEBE” – double E.  
- V, L, E, D, E – “VLEDE” – not a word.  

Hmm, seems scarce. Let me try L in position 4:  
- _ _ _ L E  
Example:  
- B, L, E, D, E – “BLEDE” – not a word.  
- C, L, E, F, E – “CLEFE” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, B, E – “DLEBE” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, B, E – “FLEBE” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, D, E – “MLEDE” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, B, E – “PLEBE” – double E.  

Another approach: look for real words.  
“BLEED” – double E.  
“BLECH” – L in position 2.  
“BLEW” – ends in W.  
“FLECK” – L in position 2.  
“PLEBE” – double E.  
“YODEL” – ends in L.  

It appears most words with L in position 3 have double E or are uncommon.  
Let me try “BLEED” – but double E.  

Wait, let’s try “DWELLE” – but double E.  

Another check: “DWELT” – ends in T, forbidden.  

Realizing the scarcity, let’s try “BLEED” – but double E.  

Actually, let’s try “BELLE” – double E.  

Let me try “FLECK” – L in position 2, forbidden.  

Seems stuck. Let me try “DWELLE” – double E.  

Another systematic word list ending in E, avoiding forbidden letters:  
- B, L, E, E, D – “BLEED” – double E.  
- C, L, E, E, D – “CLEED” – not a word.  
- D, L, E, E, B – “DLEEB” – not a word.  
- F, L, E, E, D – “FLEED” – double E.  
- H, L, E, E, D – “HLEED” – not a word.  
- M, L, E, E, D – “MLEED” – not a word.  
- P, L, E, E, D – “PLEED” – not a word.  
- V, L, E, E, D – “VLEED” – not a word.  

Thus, the only common word with L in position 3 is “BLEED”, but it has double E.  

However, the feedback only forbids A,R,O,S,I,T,U,N,G.  
Double E is allowed since E is confirmed in position 5.  

But “BLEED” has E in position 4 and 5, but our feedback only confirms E in position 5, so E in position 4 is allowed?  
Actually, the feedback only tells us E is in position 5, it doesn’t say anything about other E’s.  

So “BLEED” is a valid candidate:  
- Ends in E (position 5).  
- Contains L in position 3 (not 1 or 2).  
- Uses only allowed letters B,L,E,D.  

Let’s check:  
B – allowed  
L – must appear, allowed  
E – allowed in position 5, and position 4 E is not forbidden.  
D – allowed.  

Thus, “BLEED” fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ELITE -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) I(x) T(x) E(✓)

Guess 4: BLEED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) E(-) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the four rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E is in position 5, and A,R,O,S are absent.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(-) I(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E not in position 1, L is in the word but not in position 2, I,T are absent.

3. LUNGE → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ L not in position 1, U,N,G absent.

4. BLEED → B(x) L(-) E(-) E(-) D(x)  
   ⇒ B and D are absent, L is not in position 2 (already known), and the two E’s are both marked “-” meaning E is not in positions 1,2,3,4 (only confirmed in position 5). This is consistent.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, T, U, N, G, B, D.

Remaining usable consonants: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus L (which must appear once) and E (fixed in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- contains L exactly once, not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from BLEED feedback).  
- therefore L must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ L E

We must use only allowed letters for positions 1,2,3: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list valid words fitting _ _ _ L E with those letters:

- C, H, E, L, E → CHELE – not standard.  
- C, O, L, E – but O is forbidden.  
- F, L, E, E – but F is allowed, but word must be _ _ _ L E.  
- C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
- C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (rare).  
- F, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
- H, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
- P, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
- V, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
- W, H, E, L, E – WHELE – not standard.  
- C, H, U, L, E – U forbidden.  
- C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  

Actually, the only common word fitting _ _ _ L E with allowed letters is:

C, H, E, L, E – but CHELE is uncommon.  
Another check: C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  

Wait, let me systematically list:

Possible consonants for positions 1,2,3: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word of the form _ _ _ L E.

Looking up, the only common word is:

C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (not standard).  
F, L, E, E – not 5 letters.  
H, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
M, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
P, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
V, E, L, E – not 5 letters.  
W, H, E, L, E – WHELE (not standard).  

Another systematic check: _ _ _ L E with allowed letters.

Let’s try:

C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (valid but rare).  
C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
F, L, E, C, E – not a word.  
H, L, E, C, E – not a word.  
J, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
K, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
M, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
P, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
V, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
W, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
X, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
Y, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
Z, L, E, F, E – not a word.  

The only valid word seems to be CHELE, but it’s uncommon.  
However, the rules don’t require common words, just valid English.

Thus, the correct next guess is CHELE.

But let me double-check:  
Is there another word?  
C, H, E, L, E – CHELE  
C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
F, L, E, C, E – not a word.  

Yes, CHELE appears to be the only valid word fitting the constraints.

But wait, let me think again.  
Actually, the word “CHELE” is valid but uncommon.  
Another possibility is “FLECE” – but F,L,E,C,E – L is in position 3, which is forbidden (from BLEED feedback L is not in position 3).  

Thus, the only valid word fitting _ _ _ L E with L in position 4 is CHELE.

However, let me re-examine:  
The pattern is _ _ _ L E, and L must be in position 4.  
The only valid English word with L in position 4 and E in position 5, using allowed letters, is:

C, H, E, L, E – CHELE (valid but rare).  
Another check:  
C, L, E, F, E – not a word.  
H, L, E, C, E – not a word.  

Thus, the correct next guess is CHELE.

But let me verify with another systematic approach:  
List all 5-letter words ending in LE, then filter by allowed letters.

Common words ending in LE:
- CHIDE – I forbidden.  
- CLEFS – S forbidden.  
- CLEW – too short.  
- CLOVE – O forbidden.  
- COBLE – O,B forbidden.  
- DOLLE – D forbidden.  
- FLECK – K allowed, but L is in position 3, forbidden (from BLEED feedback L is not in position 3).  
- FLEET – T forbidden.  
- GLOVE – O,G forbidden.  
- GROVE – O,R forbidden.  
- HUBLE – U,B forbidden.  
- JOLLE – J allowed, but L is in position 3, forbidden.  
- KLOOF – not ending in LE.  
- MOLLE – O forbidden.  
- NOBLE – O,N,B forbidden.  
- PLOTE – O,T forbidden.  
- ROULE – O,R,U forbidden.  
- SLOPE – O,S forbidden.  
- SLOTE – S,T,O forbidden.  
- SPOLE – S,O forbidden.  
- STOLE – S,T,O forbidden.  
- SWOLE – S,W,O,L,E – S,O,W,L,E – S and O forbidden.  
- TLOTE – T,O forbidden.  
- VLOTE – V,L,O,T,E – O,T forbidden.  
- YODEL – D forbidden.  
- ZLOTE – Z,L,O,T,E – O,T forbidden.  

From this exhaustive check, the only valid word fitting _ _ _ L E with allowed letters is CHELE.

Therefore, the next guess is CHELE.

But let me re-express CHELE in the required format:

From the five rounds we now know:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E is in position 5, and A,R,O,S are absent.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(-) I(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E not in positions 1,2,3,4 (only confirmed in 5).  
   L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from BLEED and CHELE feedback).  
   Therefore L must be in position 1.

3. LUNGE → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ L not in position 1 (but this contradicts point 2 unless we re-read carefully).

Wait, let’s re-express the feedback carefully:

- ELITE: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1.  
- L(-) means L is in word but not in position 2.  
- I(x) and T(x) mean I,T absent.  
- E(✓) in position 5 confirms E is in position 5.

- LUNGE: L(-) means L is in word but not in position 1.  
  U(x), N(x), G(x) mean U,N,G absent.  
  E(✓) confirms E in position 5.

- BLEED: B(x), D(x) mean B,D absent.  
  L(-) means L not in position 2 (already known).  
  E(-) in positions 3,4 means E not in 3,4 (consistent with E only in 5).

- CHELE: C(x) means C absent.  
  H(-) means H is in word but not in position 2.  
  E(-) in position 3 means E not in 3 (consistent).  
  L(-) in position 4 means L not in 4.  
  E(✓) confirms E in position 5.

Summary of constraints:
- Word is _ _ _ _ E.
- Letters present: E (position 5), L, H.
- Letters absent: A,R,O,S,I,T,U,N,G,B,D,C.
- L cannot be in positions 2,1,4 (from LUNGE, ELITE, BLEED, CHELE).  
  Therefore L must be in position 3.
- H cannot be in position 2 (from CHELE), so H must be in position 1 or 4.
- Position 4 cannot be L (already), so if H is in 1, then 4 must be another letter.

So far we have:
- L must be in position 3.
- H must be in position 1 or 4.
- Allowed letters left: F, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus H,L,E).

Possible patterns:
1. H _ L _ E (H in 1, L in 3)
2. _ _ L H E (H in 4, L in 3)

Check pattern 1: H _ L _ E
Need two consonants in positions 2 and 4 from allowed set {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.
Possible words:
- H, F, L, E, ? – need 5 letters.  
  H, F, L, E, ? – position 4 must be consonant, position 2 must be consonant.  
  Example: H, F, L, E, ? – need a 5th letter.  
  H, F, L, E, ? – must be consonant.

No valid words in pattern 1.

Check pattern 2: _ _ L H E
Need two consonants in positions 1 and 2 from allowed set {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.
Possible words:
- F, J, L, H, E – F J L H E – not a word.  
- F, K, L, H, E – F K L H E – not a word.  
- F, M, L, H, E – F M L H E – not a word.

- Y, F, L, H, E – Y F L H E – not a word.  
- Z, F, L, H, E – Z F L H E – not a word.  

No valid words in pattern 2 either.

This suggests an inconsistency in our earlier interpretation. Let me re-express the L constraints:

From:
- ELITE: L(-) → L not in position 2.  
- LUNGE: L(-) → L not in position 1.  
- BLEED: L(-) → L not in position 2 (redundant).  
- CHELE: L(-) in position 4 → L not in position 4.  

Thus, L cannot be in positions 1,2,4.  
With word length 5 and E fixed in position 5, the only remaining position for L is position 3.

So the word must be: _ _ L _ E.

Now, H must be in the word (from CHELE: H(-) means H is present but not in position 2).  
Thus H must be in position 1 or 4.

Pattern options:
1. H _ L _ E (H in 1, L in 3)  
   Need consonants in positions 2 and 4 from allowed set {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.  
   Possible words:  
   - H, F, L, E, ? – position 4 must be consonant.  
     H, F, L, E, K – H F L E K – not a word.  
     H, F, L, E, M – H F L E M – not a word.  
     H, F, L, E, P – H F L E P – not a word.  
     H, J, L, E, F – H J L E F – not a word.  
     H, K, L, E, F – H K L E F – not a word.  
     H, M, L, E, F – H M L E F – not a word.  
     H, P, L, E, F – H P L E F – not a word.  
     H, V, L, E, F – H V L E F – not a word.  
     H, W, L, E, F – H W L E F – not a word.  
     H, X, L, E, F – H X L E F – not a word.  
     H, Y, L, E, F – H Y L E F – not a word.  
     H, Z, L, E, F – H Z L E F – not a word.  

   No valid words in this pattern.

2. _ _ L H E (H in 4, L in 3)  
   Need consonants in positions 1 and 2 from allowed set {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.  
   Possible words:  
   - F, J, L, H, E – F J L H E – not a word.  
   - F, K, L, H, E – F K L H E – not a word.  
   - F, M, L, H, E – F M L H E – not a word.  
   - F, P, L, H, E – F P L H E – not a word.  
   - J, F, L, H, E – J F L H E – not a word.  
   - K, F, L, H, E – K F L H E – not a word.  
   - M, F, L, H, E – M F L H E – not a word.  
   - P, F, L, H, E – P F L H E – not a word.  
   - V, F, L, H, E – V F L H E – not a word.  
   - W, F, L, H, E – W F L H E – not a word.  
   - X, F, L, H, E – X F L H E – not a word.  
   - Y, F, L, H, E – Y F L H E – not a word.  
   - Z, F, L, H, E – Z F L H E – not a word.  

   No valid words in this pattern either.

This implies we may have missed a letter or misread the constraints. Re-examining the allowed letters:

Forbidden letters: A,R,O,S,I,T,U,N,G,B,D,C.  
Allowed letters: E (position 5), L (position 3), H (position 1 or 4), plus remaining consonants: F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Given the constraints, the only possible word structure is _ _ L _ E with H in position 1 or 4.

However, none of the combinations form a valid English word. This suggests an inconsistency, likely due to an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-evaluating the BLEED feedback:  
BLEED: B(x) L(-) E(-) E(-) D(x)  
- L(-) means L is in word but not in position 2.  
- E(-) in positions 3,4 means E is not in 3,4 (consistent with E only in 5).  
Thus, L could be in 3 or 5, but 5 is E, so L must be in 3.

Similarly, CHELE: C(x) H(-) E(-) L(-) E(✓)  
- H(-) means H is in word but not in position 2.  
- L(-) in position 4 means L is not in 4 (consistent with L in 3).  
Thus, H must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is L, so H must be in 1.

Thus, the word must be H _ L _ E with H in 1, L in 3, and E in 5.

Now, positions 2 and 4 must be filled with allowed consonants from {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Looking for valid English words:  
H, F, L, E, ? – position 4 must be consonant.  
H, F, L, E, K – H F L E K – not a word.  
H, F, L, E, M – H F L E M – not a word.  
H, F, L, E, P – H F L E P – not a word.  
H, J, L, E, F – H J L E F – not a word.  
H, K, L, E, F – H K L E F – not a word.  
H, M, L, E, F – H M L E F – not a word.  
H, P, L, E, F – H P L E F – not a word.  
H, V, L, E, F – H V L E F – not a word.  
H, W, L, E, F – H W L E F – not a word.  
H, X, L, E, F – H X L E F – not a word.  
H, Y, L, E, F – H Y L E F – not a word.  
H, Z, L, E, F – H Z L E F – not a word.  

None of these are valid words. This suggests we may have missed a letter or misread the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback carefully:
- From all rounds, the confirmed letters are E (position 5) and L (position 3).  
- H is confirmed to be in the word (from CHELE: H(-)), and must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Position 4 cannot be L (already in 3), so H must be in position 1.

Thus, the word must be H _ L _ E.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern with allowed consonants is:

H, E, L, E, ? – but E is already in 5.  
Wait, positions 2 and 4 must be consonants from remaining set.

Looking up, the only valid word is:

H, E, L, E, ? – no.  
H, E, L, _ , E – no.  

Actually, the word ""HELVE"" comes to mind:
- H E L V E  
- Letters: H, E, L, V, E  
- E is in position 5 (correct).  
- L is in position 3 (correct).  
- H is in position 1 (correct).  
- V is allowed (not in forbidden set).  
- E in position 2 is allowed (only position 5 is confirmed, others not forbidden).

""HELVE"" is a valid 5-letter English word meaning the ridge of a blade of grass or the ridge on an axe.

Thus, the correct next guess is HELVE.

- LUNGE: L(-) → L not in position 1.  
- BLEED: L(-) → L not in position 2 (redundant).

Thus, L cannot be in positions 1,2,4.

2. _ _ L H E (H in 4, L in 3)  
   Need consonants in positions 1 and 2 from allowed set {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.  
   Possible words:  
   - F, J, L, H, E – F J L H E – not a word.  
   - F, K, L, H, E – F K L H E – not a word.  
   - F, M, L, H, E – F M L H E – not a word.  
   - F, P, L, H, E – F P L H E – not a word.  
   - J, F, L, H, E – J F L H E – not a word.  
   - K, F, L, H, E – K F L H E – not a word.  
   - M, F, L, H, E – M F L H E – not a word.  
   - P, F, L, H, E – P F L H E – not a word.

   - X, F, L, H, E – X F L H E – not a word.  
   - Y, F, L, H, E – Y F L H E – not a word.  
   - Z, F, L, H, E – Z F L H E – not a word.  

   No valid words in this pattern either.

This implies we may have missed a letter or misread the constraints. Re-examining the allowed letters:

Forbidden letters: A,R,O,S,I,T,U,N,G,B,D,C.  
Allowed letters: E (position 5), L (position 3), H (position 1 or 4), plus remaining consonants: F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Given the constraints, the only possible word structure is _ _ L _ E with H in position 1 or 4.

However, none of the combinations form a valid English word. This suggests an inconsistency, likely due to an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-evaluating the BLEED feedback:  
BLEED: B(x) L(-) E(-) E(-) D(x)  
- L(-) means L is in word but not in position 2.  
- E(-) in positions 3,4 means E is not in 3,4 (consistent with E only in 5).  
Thus, L could be in 3 or 5, but 5 is E, so L must be in 3.

Similarly, CHELE: C(x) H(-) E(-) L(-) E(✓)  
- H(-) means H is in word but not in position 2.  
- L(-) in position 4 means L is not in 4 (consistent with L in 3).  
Thus, H must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is L, so H must be in 1.

Thus, the word must be H _ L _ E with H in 1, L in 3, and E in 5.

Now, positions 2 and 4 must be filled with allowed consonants from {F,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Looking for valid English words:  
H, F, L, E, ? – position 4 must be consonant.  
H, F, L, E, K – H F L E K – not a word.  
H, F, L, E, M – H F L E M – not a word.  
H, F, L, E, P – H F L E P – not a word.  
H, J, L, E, F – H J L E F – not a word.  
H, K, L, E, F – H K L E F – not a word.  
H, M, L, E, F – H M L E F – not a word.  
H, P, L, E, F – H P L E F – not a word.  
H, V, L, E, F – H V L E F – not a word.  
H, W, L, E, F – H W L E F – not a word.  
H, X, L, E, F – H X L E F – not a word.  
H, Y, L, E, F – H Y L E F – not a word.  
H, Z, L, E, F – H Z L E F – not a word.  

None of these are valid words. This suggests we may have missed a letter or misread the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback carefully:
- From all rounds, the confirmed letters are E (position 5) and L (position 3).  
- H is confirmed to be in the word (from CHELE: H(-)), and must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Position 4 cannot be L (already in 3), so H must be in position 1.

Thus, the word must be H _ L _ E.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern with allowed consonants is:

H, E, L, E, ? – but E is already in 5.  
Wait, positions 2 and 4 must be consonants from remaining set.

Looking up, the only valid word is:

H, E, L, E, ? – no.  
H, E, L, _ , E – no.  

Actually, the word ""HELVE"" comes to mind:
- H E L V E  
- Letters: H, E, L, V, E  
- E is in position 5 (correct).  
- L is in position 3 (correct).  
- H is in position 1 (correct).  
- V is allowed (not in forbidden set).  
- E in position 2 is allowed (only position 5 is confirmed, others not forbidden).

""HELVE"" is a valid 5-letter English word meaning the ridge of a blade of grass or the ridge on an axe.

Thus, the correct next guess is HELVE.",Guess 6: HELVE -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) L(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
