For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should have distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 4 other letters to determine (since A is already confirmed).

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that
- keeps the known A in a different position,
- avoids S, L, T, E,
- introduces as many new common consonants and vowels as possible.

Common remaining high-frequency letters: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- RADIO (R, D, I, O) – but O is 5th, and A is 2nd here (different from 3rd in SLATE)
- RANCH (R, N, C, H) – but A is 2nd
- CHAIN (C, H, I, N) – A is 3rd, which we know is wrong
- PIANO (P, I, O) – A is 2nd

""RADIO"" looks good: A is 2nd (not 3rd), and it brings in R, D, I, O – four new letters.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, B  
Letters that ARE in the word (wrong positions):  
- A (wrong in positions 2, 3)  
- I (wrong in positions 4, 5)  
- G (wrong in position 1)

So the word must contain A, I, and G, and the other two letters must come from the still-untested set: C, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- A cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.  
- I cannot be in 4th or 5th position.  
- G cannot be in 1st position.

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies these rules and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3  
Possible positions for G: 2, 3, 4, 5  

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- If A is 1st, I must be 2nd or 3rd, G must be 2nd-5th (not 1st).  
- If A is 4th, I must be 1st-3rd, G must be 2nd-5th.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:

We have three required letters: A, I, G.

Possible positions:
A: 1, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3  
G: 2, 3, 4, 5  

And two more letters from remaining: C, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Letters used: A, G, I, N. The fifth letter is G (repetition).  
But we need two new letters, not necessarily distinct.  

But we have only five positions, so AGING uses A, G, I, N, G.  
But we need to introduce two new letters, and N is new, G is repeated.  

But we have only three required letters (A, I, G), and two more letters must be from allowed set.  

AGING has N as the fourth letter, and G as fifth.  
So letters are A, G, I, N, G.  
This fits: A, I, G are present, N is new, G is repeated.  

But we need to check if AGING is a valid word – yes, it is.  

Let me verify:  
A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), G is 2nd (allowed), N is 4th (new), G is 5th (repetition).  
No forbidden letters.  

Thus, AGING seems to be a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should have distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 4 other letters to determine (since A is already confirmed).

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that
- keeps the known A in a different position,
- avoids S, L, T, E,
- introduces as many new common consonants and vowels as possible.

Common remaining high-frequency letters: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- RADIO (R, D, I, O) – but O is 5th, and A is 2nd here (different from 3rd in SLATE)
- RANCH (R, N, C, H) – but A is 2nd
- CHAIN (C, H, I, N) – A is 3rd, which we know is wrong
- PIANO (P, I, O) – A is 2nd

""RADIO"" looks good: A is 2nd (not 3rd), and it brings in R, D, I, O – four new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
   - A (wrong in position 3 and 2)  
   - I (wrong in position 4)

So the word must contain A and I, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-untested set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3  
- I cannot be in position 4  

A good next guess should:
- place A and I in new positions,  
- introduce several new consonants,  
- avoid all the eliminated letters.

Candidate words:
- CANNI (invalid – two N’s, and I in 4)  
- MIAOW (invalid – O is out)  
- PAINT (invalid – T is out)  
- CHAIN (invalid – T is out and A in 3)  
- VAPID (invalid – D is out)  
- GAMBI (valid: G, A, M, B, I) – A in 2 (still allowed), I in 5.

Let’s pick GAMBI: it uses four fresh letters (G, M, B) plus the known A and I, and places them in positions we haven’t ruled out.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, B  
Letters that ARE in the word (wrong positions):  
- A (wrong in positions 2, 3)  
- I (wrong in positions 4, 5)  
- G (wrong in position 1)

So the word must contain A, I, and G, and the other two letters must come from the still-untested set: C, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- A cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.  
- I cannot be in 4th or 5th position.  
- G cannot be in 1st position.

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies these rules and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3  
Possible positions for G: 2, 3, 4, 5  

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- If A is 1st, I must be 2nd or 3rd, G must be 2nd-5th (not 1st).  
- If A is 4th, I must be 1st-3rd, G must be 2nd-5th.  
- If A is 5th, I must be 1st-3rd, G must be 2nd-5th.

Candidate words:
- AIG_ _  – but G must be after A if A is 1st.  
- CAVIG – invalid letters.  
- HAIRY – contains R (out).  
- GAINS – contains S (out).  
- KNAFI – uses N, K, F, A, I. Check positions:  
  K(1), N(2), A(3) – but A cannot be 3rd.  
- PIANO – O is out.  
- VAGUE – E is out.  
- GAINS – S is out.

We have three required letters: A, I, G.

Possible positions:
A: 1, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3  
G: 2, 3, 4, 5  

And two more letters from remaining: C, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try A in 1st, I in 2nd, G in 3rd:  
Word form: A I G _ _

A I G N K – not a word.  

Try A in 1st, I in 3rd, G in 2nd:  
A G I _ _

AGICK – not a word.  
AGINE – E is out.  
AGING – G is repeated (but allowed), and G is 2nd (allowed), A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed).  
AGING – check letters: A, G, I, N, G – but G is repeated, which is allowed.  
But is AGING a valid word? Yes.  
Check constraints:  
A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), G is 2nd (allowed).  
Letters used: A, G, I, N. The fifth letter is G (repetition).  
But we need two new letters, not necessarily distinct.  

But we have only five positions, so AGING uses A, G, I, N, G.  
But we need to introduce two new letters, and N is new, G is repeated.  

But we have only three required letters (A, I, G), and two more letters must be from allowed set.  

AGING has N as the fourth letter, and G as fifth.  
So letters are A, G, I, N, G.  
This fits: A, I, G are present, N is new, G is repeated.  

But we need to check if AGING is a valid word – yes, it is.  

Let me verify:  
A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), G is 2nd (allowed), N is 4th (new), G is 5th (repetition).  
No forbidden letters.  

Thus, AGING seems to be a valid next guess.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should have distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 4 other letters to determine (since A is already confirmed).

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that
- keeps the known A in a different position,
- avoids S, L, T, E,
- introduces as many new common consonants and vowels as possible.

Common remaining high-frequency letters: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- RADIO (R, D, I, O) – but O is 5th, and A is 2nd here (different from 3rd in SLATE)
- RANCH (R, N, C, H) – but A is 2nd
- CHAIN (C, H, I, N) – A is 3rd, which we know is wrong
- PIANO (P, I, O) – A is 2nd

""RADIO"" looks good: A is 2nd (not 3rd), and it brings in R, D, I, O – four new letters.

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(x) I(-) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
   - A (wrong in position 3 and 2)  
   - I (wrong in position 4)

So the word must contain A and I, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-untested set: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3  
- I cannot be in position 4  

A good next guess should:
- place A and I in new positions,  
- introduce several new consonants,  
- avoid all the eliminated letters.

Candidate words:
- CANNI (invalid – two N’s, and I in 4)  
- MIAOW (invalid – O is out)  
- PAINT (invalid – T is out)  
- CHAIN (invalid – T is out and A in 3)  
- VAPID (invalid – D is out)  
- GAMBI (valid: G, A, M, B, I) – A in 2 (still allowed), I in 5.

Let’s pick GAMBI: it uses four fresh letters (G, M, B) plus the known A and I, and places them in positions we haven’t ruled out.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, B  
Letters that ARE in the word (wrong positions):  
- A (wrong in positions 2, 3)  
- I (wrong in positions 4, 5)  
- G (wrong in position 1)

So the word must contain A, I, and G, and the other two letters must come from the still-untested set: C, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- A cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.  
- I cannot be in 4th or 5th position.  
- G cannot be in 1st position.

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies these rules and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3  
Possible positions for G: 2, 3, 4, 5  

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- If A is 1st, I must be 2nd or 3rd, G must be 2nd-5th (not 1st).  
- If A is 4th, I must be 1st-3rd, G must be 2nd-5th.  
- If A is 5th, I must be 1st-3rd, G must be 2nd-5th.

Candidate words:
- AIG_ _  – but G must be after A if A is 1st.  
- CAVIG – invalid letters.  
- HAIRY – contains R (out).  
- GAINS – contains S (out).  
- KNAFI – uses N, K, F, A, I. Check positions:  
  K(1), N(2), A(3) – but A cannot be 3rd.  
- PIANO – O is out.  
- VAGUE – E is out.  
- GAINS – S is out.  
- JAGGY – G is 2nd (allowed), A is 3rd (not allowed).  
- GAZPI – Z, P, I. G is 1st (not allowed).  
- KNAFI already failed.  
- HAKKI – K, H, I. A is 3rd (not allowed).  
- PAGOD – O, D are out.  
- VAPID – D is out.  
- FANCY – C, N, Y. No G or I.  
- JIFFY – J, F, Y. No A or I.  
- KNAFI already failed.  
- VAGUE – E is out.  
- JAGGY – A is 3rd (not allowed).  
- KNAFI – A is 3rd.  
- PIANO – O is out.  
- GAINS – S is out.  
- HAKKI – A is 3rd.  
- GAZPI – G is 1st (not allowed).  
- JAGGY – A is 3rd.  
- PAGOD – O, D are out.  
- VAPID – D is out.  
- FANCY – no G or I.  
- KNAFI – A is 3rd.  
- PIANO – O is out.  
- GAINS – S is out.  
- HAKKI – A is 3rd.  
- GAZPI – G is 1st.  

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:

We have three required letters: A, I, G.

Possible positions:
A: 1, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3  
G: 2, 3, 4, 5  

And two more letters from remaining: C, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try A in 1st, I in 2nd, G in 3rd:  
Word form: A I G _ _  
Need two more letters from allowed set.  
Possible: A I G N K → AIGNK – not a word.  
A I G N C → AIGNC – not a word.  
A I G N P → AIGNP – not a word.  
A I G N H → AIGNH – not a word.  
A I G N V → AIGNV – not a word.  
A I G N Y → AIGNY – not a word.  
A I G N Z → AIGNZ – not a word.  
A I G N J → AIGNJ – not a word.  
A I G N F → AIGNF – not a word.  
A I G N Q → AIGNQ – not a word.  
A I G N U → AIGNU – not a word.  

A I G N K – not a word.  

Try A in 1st, I in 3rd, G in 2nd:  
A G I _ _  
Need two letters.  
AGICK – not a word.  
AGINE – E is out.  
AGING – G is repeated (but allowed), and G is 2nd (allowed), A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed).  
AGING – check letters: A, G, I, N, G – but G is repeated, which is allowed.  
But is AGING a valid word? Yes.  
Check constraints:  
A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), G is 2nd (allowed).  
Letters used: A, G, I, N. The fifth letter is G (repetition).  
But we need two new letters, not necessarily distinct.  

But we have only five positions, so AGING uses A, G, I, N, G.  
But we need to introduce two new letters, and N is new, G is repeated.  

But we have only three required letters (A, I, G), and two more letters must be from allowed set.  

AGING has N as the fourth letter, and G as fifth.  
So letters are A, G, I, N, G.  
This fits: A, I, G are present, N is new, G is repeated.  

But we need to check if AGING is a valid word – yes, it is.  

Let me verify:  
A is 1st (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), G is 2nd (allowed), N is 4th (new), G is 5th (repetition).  
No forbidden letters.  

Thus, AGING seems to be a valid next guess.

G(-) → G is in the word but NOT in 2nd position  
I(✓) → I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position  
N(✓) → N is in the word and in the correct 4th position  
G(✓) → G is in the word and in the correct 5th position  

So the word structure is now fully determined:

1st letter: A  
2nd letter: ? (must be a letter not yet placed)  
3rd letter: I  
4th letter: N  
5th letter: G  

We only need to find the 2nd letter.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out and not yet placed):  
From earlier eliminations, the letters NOT in the word are:  
S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, B  

Letters already used in the word: A, G, I, N (so they cannot appear again).  
Thus the 2nd letter must be one of the remaining consonants:  
C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Looking for a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern A _ I N G, the only common one is:

A + C + I + N + G → ACING  
A + F + I + N + G → AFING (not a word)  
A + H + I + N + G → AHING (not a word)  
A + K + I + N + G → AKING (not a word)  
A + P + I + N + G → APING (valid word)  
A + V + I + N + G → AVING (not a word)  

The valid options are ACING and APING.  
Between these, ACING is more common in word lists, so I’ll choose that.
