### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique letters that are among the most common. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique letters that are among the most common. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S
- Positions ruled out: A≠1, R≠2, E≠5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (each exactly once)
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2
5. Places E somewhere other than position 5

A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since E≠5)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A≠1)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R≠2)
- L and Y are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This gives us fresh coverage of positions 4 and 5.

Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - O, S are not in the word.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(-)
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in position 2 (✓), so A is fixed at position 2.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L is not in the word.
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of constraints:
- Word structure: _ A _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, E, Y
- Letters known NOT in the word: O, S, L
- Positions ruled out:
  - A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (but we already know it's in position 2 from EARLY)
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  - E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
  - Y cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- Exactly one each of R, E, Y somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, 5
- No O, S, L

Possible positions for remaining letters:
Position 1: R, E, Y (but R cannot be in position 2 or 3, so R could be 1, 4, 5)
Position 3: R, E, Y (but R cannot be here)
Position 4: R, E, Y
Position 5: R, E, Y (but E and Y cannot be here)

Let's try to place the letters:
- Position 1: Could be R, E, or Y
- Position 3: Could be E or Y
- Position 4: Could be R, E, or Y
- Position 5: Could be R (but Y and E cannot be here)

A good candidate is ""BRAVE"" but B hasn't been tested yet, and we have constraints. However, we know A is in position 2, so let's try ""CAREY"" but C hasn't been tested. 

Looking at possible combinations:
- R must be in the word (from AROSE), cannot be in 2 or 3, so possible 1, 4, 5
- E must be in the word (from AROSE), cannot be in 1 or 5, so possible 3 or 4
- Y must be in the word (from EARLY), cannot be in 5, so possible 1, 3, 4

Let's try ""CAREY"":
- C: new letter
- A: position 2 (✓)

Try ""RACON"" but O is excluded.

Try ""RABID"":

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- A (position 2 is locked)
- E (somewhere, but not 1 or 5)
- R (somewhere, but not 2, 3, or 5)
- Y (somewhere, but not 1 or 5)

Letters that are definitely out: O, S, L, G.

Positions so far:
1: cannot be Y (from YAGER), cannot be O/S/L/G, and must be one of R, E, Y — but R cannot be in 1? Wait, R has only been ruled out of 2 and 3, so 1 and 4 and 5 are still open for R.
But we have only 5 positions and we already have A fixed at 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We still need to place E, R, Y in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, with these constraints:
- E ≠ 1,5 → E must be 3 or 4
- R ≠ 2,3,5 → R must be 1 or 4
- Y ≠ 1,5 → Y must be 3 or 4

Let’s list the remaining slots:
Positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
Letters to place: E, R, Y
But we have 4 positions and 3 letters, so one more letter is needed (it must be a new letter not yet tested).

Possible placements:
Case 1: R in 1
Then E and Y must be in 3 and 4 (order unknown).
So possible words:
R A E Y _  → need a 5th letter, but 5th must be new
R A Y E _  → same

Case 2: R in 4
Then E and Y must be in 3 and 5, but Y cannot be in 5 → impossible.
So R must be in 1.

Thus the only possible structure is:
R A E Y ?  or  R A Y E ?
But we need a 5th letter. The 5th letter must be a new letter not yet used (not O,S,L,G,A,E,R,Y).

Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Z.

Let’s try to pick a letter that gives us the most information. Let’s try “C” next.

Possible word: R A E Y C → “RAEYC” is not valid.
R A Y E C → “RAYEC” is not valid.

We need valid English words.

Looking for valid 5-letter words with pattern R A _ _ _ or _ A _ _ _ but A is fixed at 2.

Actually, the structure is: [1] A [3] [4] [5], with A at 2.

From above, the only possible placement is:
R A E Y ?  or  R A Y E ?

But we need a valid word. Let’s think of valid English words that fit R A _ _ _ with remaining letters.

Wait, let’s think differently: we have 4 positions (1,3,4,5) and 4 letters to place: E, R, Y plus one more letter.

But we already have A at 2.

Actually, the letters in the word are A, E, R, Y — four letters — so the 5th position must be one of these four letters, but they are already placed.

Wait, no: the word is 5 letters, and we know four of them (A,E,R,Y), so the fifth must be a new letter.

Thus the structure is: [1] A [3] [4] [5], and the letters in [1],[3],[4],[5] are a permutation of E,R,Y plus one new letter.

But we have constraints:
- E cannot be 1 or 5 → E must be 3 or 4
- R cannot be 2,3,5 → R must be 1 or 4
- Y cannot be 1 or 5 → Y must be 3 or 4

Let’s enumerate possible permutations:

Letters to place: E, R, Y, N (N is a new letter)
Positions: 1,3,4,5

Possible permutations:
1. R A E Y N → “RAEYN” – invalid
2. R A Y E N → “RAYEN” – invalid
3. E A R Y N – but A is at 2, so invalid
4. R A N E Y – but Y cannot be 5
5. R A N Y E – same issue
6. R A Y N E – Y at 3 is allowed, E at 5 is not allowed
7. R A E N Y – same issue

Wait, let’s systematically list valid placements:

We have:
- Position 1: R or new letter (but R is allowed here)
- Position 3: E or Y
- Position 4: E or Y or R
- Position 5: new letter (since E and Y cannot be here)

But we must use E, R, Y plus one new letter.

Thus the only way is:
- R must be in 1 or 4
- E must be in 3 or 4
- Y must be in 3 or 4

Case 1: R in 1
Then positions 3,4,5 must be filled with E, Y, and one new letter.
But we have only two positions left (3,4) and need to place E, Y plus one new letter – impossible.

Case 2: R in 4
Then positions 1,3,5 must be filled with E, Y, and one new letter.
But E cannot be 1 or 5, so E must be 3.
Y cannot be 1 or 5, so Y must be 3 or 4 – but 4 is R, so Y must be 3.
But E and Y cannot both be 3. Thus impossible.

This suggests our assumption that the word contains exactly A,E,R,Y is wrong. Actually, the word could contain A plus some subset of E,R,Y, with the remaining letters being new.

But from the feedback:
- A is in the word (from AROSE and EARLY)
- R is in the word (from AROSE)
- E is in the word (from AROSE)
- Y is in the word (from EARLY)

Thus the word must contain A,E,R,Y – four letters – so the fifth must be a new letter.

But as shown, no valid English word fits with current constraints. This implies an error in earlier reasoning.

Re-examining the constraints:
From YAGER feedback:
- Y(-): Y is in word but not position 1
- A(✓): A is in position 2
- G(x): G not in word
- E(✓): E is in position 4
- R(-): R is in word but not position 5

Thus:
- E is in position 4 (locked)
- A is in position 2 (locked)
- R is in word but not 2,3,5 → must be position 1
- Y is in word but not 1,5 → must be position 3
- Position 5 must be a new letter

Thus the word structure is: R A Y E ?
With the 5th letter being new and not O,S,L,G.

Possible valid words: RAYON, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED.

Looking at valid English 5-letter words starting with RAYE:
- RAYED
- RAYON
- RAYED

Let’s try RAYON:
- R:1 (allowed)
- A:2 (✓)
- Y:3 (allowed)
- O: but O was excluded from AROSE feedback (O(x))
Thus RAYON is invalid due to O.

Next valid word: RAYED
- R:1
- A:2
- Y:3
- E:4
- D:5 (new letter, not excluded)
This fits all constraints:
- Contains A,E,R,Y
- A at 2
- E at 4
- R at 1
- Y at 3
- D at 5 (new letter)
- No O,S,L,G

Thus the correct guess is RAYED.
</think>

<guess>RAYED</guess>",RAYED,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- A (position 2 is locked)
- E (somewhere, but not 1 or 5)
- R (somewhere, but not 2, 3, or 5)
- Y (somewhere, but not 1 or 5)

Letters that are definitely out: O, S, L, G.

Positions so far:
1: cannot be Y (from YAGER), cannot be O/S/L/G, and must be one of R, E, Y — but R cannot be in 1? Wait, R has only been ruled out of 2 and 3, so 1 and 4 and 5 are still open for R.
But we have only 5 positions and we already have A fixed at 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We still need to place E, R, Y in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, with these constraints:
- E ≠ 1,5 → E must be 3 or 4
- R ≠ 2,3,5 → R must be 1 or 4
- Y ≠ 1,5 → Y must be 3 or 4

Let’s list the remaining slots:
Positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
Letters to place: E, R, Y
But we have 4 positions and 3 letters, so one more letter is needed (it must be a new letter not yet tested).

Possible placements:
Case 1: R in 1
Then E and Y must be in 3 and 4 (order unknown).
So possible words:
R A E Y _  → need a 5th letter, but 5th must be new
R A Y E _  → same

Case 2: R in 4
Then E and Y must be in 3 and 5, but Y cannot be in 5 → impossible.
So R must be in 1.

Thus the only possible structure is:
R A E Y ?  or  R A Y E ?
But we need a 5th letter. The 5th letter must be a new letter not yet used (not O,S,L,G,A,E,R,Y).

Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Z.

Let’s try to pick a letter that gives us the most information. Let’s try “C” next.

Possible word: R A E Y C → “RAEYC” is not valid.
R A Y E C → “RAYEC” is not valid.

We need valid English words.

Looking for valid 5-letter words with pattern R A _ _ _ or _ A _ _ _ but A is fixed at 2.

Actually, the structure is: [1] A [3] [4] [5], with A at 2.

From above, the only possible placement is:
R A E Y ?  or  R A Y E ?

But we need a valid word. Let’s think of valid English words that fit R A _ _ _ with remaining letters.

Wait, let’s think differently: we have 4 positions (1,3,4,5) and 4 letters to place: E, R, Y plus one more letter.

But we already have A at 2.

Actually, the letters in the word are A, E, R, Y — four letters — so the 5th position must be one of these four letters, but they are already placed.

Wait, no: the word is 5 letters, and we know four of them (A,E,R,Y), so the fifth must be a new letter.

Thus the structure is: [1] A [3] [4] [5], and the letters in [1],[3],[4],[5] are a permutation of E,R,Y plus one new letter.

But we have constraints:
- E cannot be 1 or 5 → E must be 3 or 4
- R cannot be 2,3,5 → R must be 1 or 4
- Y cannot be 1 or 5 → Y must be 3 or 4

Let’s enumerate possible permutations:

Letters to place: E, R, Y, N (N is a new letter)
Positions: 1,3,4,5

Possible permutations:
1. R A E Y N → “RAEYN” – invalid
2. R A Y E N → “RAYEN” – invalid
3. E A R Y N – but A is at 2, so invalid
4. R A N E Y – but Y cannot be 5
5. R A N Y E – same issue
6. R A Y N E – Y at 3 is allowed, E at 5 is not allowed
7. R A E N Y – same issue

Wait, let’s systematically list valid placements:

We have:
- Position 1: R or new letter (but R is allowed here)
- Position 3: E or Y
- Position 4: E or Y or R
- Position 5: new letter (since E and Y cannot be here)

But we must use E, R, Y plus one new letter.

Thus the only way is:
- R must be in 1 or 4
- E must be in 3 or 4
- Y must be in 3 or 4

Case 1: R in 1
Then positions 3,4,5 must be filled with E, Y, and one new letter.
But we have only two positions left (3,4) and need to place E, Y plus one new letter – impossible.

Case 2: R in 4
Then positions 1,3,5 must be filled with E, Y, and one new letter.
But E cannot be 1 or 5, so E must be 3.
Y cannot be 1 or 5, so Y must be 3 or 4 – but 4 is R, so Y must be 3.
But E and Y cannot both be 3. Thus impossible.

This suggests our assumption that the word contains exactly A,E,R,Y is wrong. Actually, the word could contain A plus some subset of E,R,Y, with the remaining letters being new.

But from the feedback:
- A is in the word (from AROSE and EARLY)
- R is in the word (from AROSE)
- E is in the word (from AROSE)
- Y is in the word (from EARLY)

Thus the word must contain A,E,R,Y – four letters – so the fifth must be a new letter.

But as shown, no valid English word fits with current constraints. This implies an error in earlier reasoning.

Re-examining the constraints:
From YAGER feedback:
- Y(-): Y is in word but not position 1
- A(✓): A is in position 2
- G(x): G not in word
- E(✓): E is in position 4
- R(-): R is in word but not position 5

Thus:
- E is in position 4 (locked)
- A is in position 2 (locked)
- R is in word but not 2,3,5 → must be position 1
- Y is in word but not 1,5 → must be position 3
- Position 5 must be a new letter

Thus the word structure is: R A Y E ?
With the 5th letter being new and not O,S,L,G.

Possible valid words: RAYON, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED, RAYED.

Looking at valid English 5-letter words starting with RAYE:
- RAYED
- RAYON
- RAYED

Let’s try RAYON:
- R:1 (allowed)
- A:2 (✓)
- Y:3 (allowed)
- O: but O was excluded from AROSE feedback (O(x))
Thus RAYON is invalid due to O.

Next valid word: RAYED
- R:1
- A:2
- Y:3
- E:4
- D:5 (new letter, not excluded)
This fits all constraints:
- Contains A,E,R,Y
- A at 2
- E at 4
- R at 1
- Y at 3
- D at 5 (new letter)
- No O,S,L,G

Thus the correct guess is RAYED.",Guess 4: RAYED -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
