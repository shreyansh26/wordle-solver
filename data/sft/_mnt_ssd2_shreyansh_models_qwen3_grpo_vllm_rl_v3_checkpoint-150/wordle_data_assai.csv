### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and all letters are distinct, which helps in narrowing down possibilities quickly. Other strong alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a balanced choice.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ABASH → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed again).
   - A appears again in position 3, but it’s marked “-” (wrong position), so the word does NOT have A in position 3.
   - B and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A.
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, E, B, H.
- Does NOT have A in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S, avoiding positions 2, 3, 4, 5 for letters we’ve ruled out, and ensuring A is not in position 3.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E, B, H): A, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S is somewhere other than position 4. Let’s list words starting with A and containing S:

- A _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- A _ _ S _ (S in position 4 – but we know S is not in position 4, so skip)
- A _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- A S _ _ _ (S in position 2)

We need to check these patterns while avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Let’s try A _ S _ _ (S in position 3):
- A C S _ _ → ACSES? Not a word.
- A D S _ _ → ADS… no.
- A L S _ _ → ALS… no.
- A M S _ _ → AMS… no.

A S _ _ _ (S in position 2):
- A S C _ _ → ASCOT (has O, ruled out), ASCRA (has R), ASICS (has I, C, S – but S is already in position 2, and we need 5 unique letters? No, duplicates are allowed unless proven otherwise. ASICS is a word, but let’s see if it fits: A(✓) S(-) I _ C _ – but we don’t know about I, C yet. However, we know S is in the word, and ASICS has S in position 2, which is allowed. But we have no feedback on I or C yet. Let’s see if there’s a better word.

A _ _ _ S (S in position 5):
- A C I D S → ACIDS (A, C, I, D, S – all letters not ruled out, S in position 5, A in position 1. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.)
- A L I D S → ALIDS – not a word.
- A M I D S → AMIDS – not a word.

ACIDS seems like the best candidate here: starts with A, ends with S, avoids all ruled-out letters, and has S in position 5 (which is allowed since S is not in position 4).

Let’s verify:
- A(✓) C _ I _ D _ S – positions 2,3,4,5: C, I, D, S. None of these are ruled out except S must be in position 5, which is fine since S is confirmed in the word and not in position 4.
- No B, O, E, R, H in the word.
- A is not in position 3 (it’s in position 1), so that’s fine.

Therefore, ACIDS is a valid next guess.

2. ABASH → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed again).
   - A appears again in position 3, but it’s marked “-” (wrong position), so the word does NOT have A in position 3.
   - B and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A.
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, E, B, H.
- Does NOT have A in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S, avoiding positions 2, 3, 4, 5 for letters we’ve ruled out, and ensuring A is not in position 3.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E, B, H): A, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S is somewhere other than position 4. Let’s list words starting with A and containing S:

- A _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- A _ _ S _ (S in position 4 – but we know S is not in position 4, so skip)
- A _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- A S _ _ _ (S in position 2)

We need to check these patterns while avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Let’s try A _ S _ _ (S in position 3):
- A C S _ _ → ACSES? Not a word.
- A D S _ _ → ADS… no.
- A L S _ _ → ALS… no.
- A M S _ _ → AMS… no.

A S _ _ _ (S in position 2):
- A S C _ _ → ASCOT (has O, ruled out), ASCRA (has R), ASICS (has I, C, S – but S is already in position 2, and we need 5 unique letters? No, duplicates are allowed unless proven otherwise. ASICS is a word, but let’s see if it fits: A(✓) S(-) I _ C _ – but we don’t know about I, C yet. However, we know S is in the word, and ASICS has S in position 2, which is allowed. But we have no feedback on I or C yet. Let’s see if there’s a better word.

A _ _ _ S (S in position 5):
- A C I D S → ACIDS (A, C, I, D, S – all letters not ruled out, S in position 5, A in position 1. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.)
- A L I D S → ALIDS – not a word.
- A M I D S → AMIDS – not a word.

ACIDS seems like the best candidate here: starts with A, ends with S, avoids all ruled-out letters, and has S in position 5 (which is allowed since S is not in position 4).

Let’s verify:
- A(✓) C _ I _ D _ S – positions 2,3,4,5: C, I, D, S. None of these are ruled out except S must be in position 5, which is fine since S is confirmed in the word and not in position 4.
- No B, O, E, R, H in the word.
- A is not in position 3 (it’s in position 1), so that’s fine.

Therefore, ACIDS is a valid next guess.

Let’s summarize the information we now have from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ABASH → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - B and H are not in the word.
   - A is not in position 3.
   - S is not in position 4 (confirmed again).

   - C and D are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is not in position 4 (confirmed again).

So the constraints so far:
- Word starts with A.
- Contains S (not in position 4).
- Contains I (not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, E, B, H, C, D.

Letters still allowed: A, I, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and I, with S not in position 4 and I not in position 3.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (since 4 is excluded).
Possible positions for I: 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is excluded).

Let’s list possible patterns:

- A S _ I _ (S in 2, I in 4)
- A S I _ _ (S in 2, I in 3 – but I can’t be in 3) – invalid
- A _ S I _ (S in 3, I in 4)
- A _ I S _ (S in 4 – invalid)
- A _ _ S I (S in 4 – invalid)
- A _ _ I S (S in 5)
- A I _ _ S (S in 5)
- A I _ S _ (S in 4 – invalid)
- A I S _ _ (S in 3, I in 2)

So valid patterns:
1. A S _ I _
2. A _ S I _
3. A _ _ I S
4. A I _ _ S
5. A I S _ _

Let’s check each pattern for possible words using allowed letters.

1. A S _ I _
   - ASKIN – but N is allowed, K is allowed. ASKIN is a word (variant of “askew” or surname). Let’s see: A(✓) S(-) K _ I _ – but we need to check if K and N are allowed (yes). ASKIN fits: A, S, I, K, N. No forbidden letters. S is in position 2 (allowed), I is in position 4 (allowed).

2. A _ S I _
   - A M S I _ – AMSI… no.
   - A L S I _ – ALSI… no.
   - A F S I _ – ASF… no.

3. A _ _ I S
   - A L I S – ALI is 3 letters, need 5.
   - A M I S – AMIS (plural of amie, valid word). A M I S – positions: A(✓) M _ I S. S is in 5 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed). No forbidden letters.

4. A I _ _ S
   - A I _ _ S – need two letters between I and S. Possible: A I N T S – AINTS (not a word), A I L T S – AILTS (not a word), A I L S _ – but S is in 5. A I G S – AIGS… no.

5. A I S _ _
   - A I S _ _ – S is in 3 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed). Possible: A I S _ _ – AIS… no.

Between the valid options, ASKIN and AMIS both fit. AMIS is simpler and uses more common letters. Let’s choose AMIS.

Check AMIS:
- A(✓) M _ I S
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S is not in 4).
- I is in position 4 (allowed, since I is not in 3).
- Letters: A, M, I, S. No forbidden letters (R, O, E, B, H, C, D).

Therefore, AMIS is a valid next guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (A _ _ _ _)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E is not in the word at all

So the pattern so far:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 2: Not R, not O, not E
- Position 3: Not O, not E
- Position 4: Not S (but S is somewhere else)
- Position 5: Not E

Letters we know are in the word: A, S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, E  

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S, and avoiding R, O, E.  
Good candidates:  
- ASKS (but repeats S)  
- ASTER (contains E)  
- ASCOT (contains O)  
- ACHES (contains E)  
- AGAST (has A twice, but valid)  
- ALOES (contains O and E)  
- ABASE (contains E)  
- ABASH (no E, no O, no R, contains S)  

""ABASH"" fits all constraints: starts with A, contains S, avoids R, O, E, and has distinct letters to maximize information.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ABASH → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed again).
   - A appears again in position 3, but it’s marked “-” (wrong position), so the word does NOT have A in position 3.
   - B and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A.
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, E, B, H.
- Does NOT have A in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S, avoiding positions 2, 3, 4, 5 for letters we’ve ruled out, and ensuring A is not in position 3.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E, B, H): A, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S is somewhere other than position 4. Let’s list words starting with A and containing S:

- A _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- A _ _ S _ (S in position 4 – but we know S is not in position 4, so skip)
- A _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- A S _ _ _ (S in position 2)

We need to check these patterns while avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Let’s try A _ S _ _ (S in position 3):
- A C S _ _ → ACSES? Not a word.
- A D S _ _ → ADS… no.
- A L S _ _ → ALS… no.
- A M S _ _ → AMS… no.

A S _ _ _ (S in position 2):
- A S C _ _ → ASCOT (has O, ruled out), ASCRA (has R), ASICS (has I, C, S – but S is already in position 2, and we need 5 unique letters? No, duplicates are allowed unless proven otherwise. ASICS is a word, but let’s see if it fits: A(✓) S(-) I _ C _ – but we don’t know about I, C yet. However, we know S is in the word, and ASICS has S in position 2, which is allowed. But we have no feedback on I or C yet. Let’s see if there’s a better word.

A _ _ _ S (S in position 5):
- A C I D S → ACIDS (A, C, I, D, S – all letters not ruled out, S in position 5, A in position 1. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.)
- A L I D S → ALIDS – not a word.
- A M I D S → AMIDS – not a word.

ACIDS seems like the best candidate here: starts with A, ends with S, avoids all ruled-out letters, and has S in position 5 (which is allowed since S is not in position 4).

Let’s verify:
- A(✓) C _ I _ D _ S – positions 2,3,4,5: C, I, D, S. None of these are ruled out except S must be in position 5, which is fine since S is confirmed in the word and not in position 4.
- No B, O, E, R, H in the word.
- A is not in position 3 (it’s in position 1), so that’s fine.

- A S I _ _ (S in 2, I in 3 – but I can’t be in 3) – invalid
- A _ S I _ (S in 3, I in 4)
- A _ I S _ (S in 4 – invalid)
- A _ _ S I (S in 4 – invalid)
- A _ _ I S (S in 5)
- A I _ _ S (S in 5)
- A I _ S _ (S in 4 – invalid)
- A I S _ _ (S in 3, I in 2)

So valid patterns:
1. A S _ I _
2. A _ S I _
3. A _ _ I S
4. A I _ _ S
5. A I S _ _

Let’s check each pattern for possible words using allowed letters.

1. A S _ I _
   - ASKIN – but N is allowed, K is allowed. ASKIN is a word (variant of “askew” or surname). Let’s see: A(✓) S(-) K _ I _ – but we need to check if K and N are allowed (yes). ASKIN fits: A, S, I, K, N. No forbidden letters. S is in position 2 (allowed), I is in position 4 (allowed).

2. A _ S I _
   - A M S I _ – AMSI… no.
   - A L S I _ – ALSI… no.
   - A F S I _ – ASF… no.

3. A _ _ I S
   - A L I S – ALI is 3 letters, need 5.
   - A M I S – AMIS (plural of amie, valid word). A M I S – positions: A(✓) M _ I S. S is in 5 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed). No forbidden letters.

4. A I _ _ S
   - A I _ _ S – need two letters between I and S. Possible: A I N T S – AINTS (not a word), A I L T S – AILTS (not a word), A I L S _ – but S is in 5. A I G S – AIGS… no.

5. A I S _ _
   - A I S _ _ – S is in 3 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed). Possible: A I S _ _ – AIS… no.

Between the valid options, ASKIN and AMIS both fit. AMIS is simpler and uses more common letters. Let’s choose AMIS.

Check AMIS:
- A(✓) M _ I S
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S is not in 4).
- I is in position 4 (allowed, since I is not in 3).
- Letters: A, M, I, S. No forbidden letters (R, O, E, B, H, C, D).

Therefore, AMIS is a valid next guess.

The feedback for Guess 4 (AMIS) says: “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means **AMIS is not a valid 5-letter word** in the target language or dictionary used by the game.  
We must therefore pick a different word that still satisfies all the constraints we’ve gathered so far.

Recap of constraints:
- Starts with A.
- Contains both S and I.
- S is **not** in position 4.
- I is **not** in position 3.
- Excludes: R, O, E, B, H, C, D.

Allowed letters: A, I, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter word that fits these rules.

Valid patterns we identified earlier:
1. A S _ I _
2. A _ S I _
3. A _ _ I S
4. A I _ _ S
5. A I S _ _

Let’s re-examine each pattern with the corrected understanding that AMIS is invalid.

1. A S _ I _
   - ASKIN is a valid 5-letter word (variant of “askew” or surname).  
     Letters: A, S, K, I, N – none are excluded.  
     Positions: S in 2 (allowed), I in 4 (allowed).  
     This fits every rule.

2. A _ S I _
   - No common 5-letter words fit here (e.g., A F S I _ → ASF… not a word).

3. A _ _ I S
   - A M I S → AMIS was rejected.  
   - A L I S → ALI is 3 letters.  
   - A N I S → ANIS is a word (variant of “anise”).  
     Letters: A, N, I, S – all allowed.  
     Positions: I in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).  
     ANIS is valid.

4. A I _ _ S
   - No common 5-letter words fit here.

5. A I S _ _
   - AIS… no valid 5-letter words.

Between ASKIN and ANIS, both fit perfectly.  
ASKIN uses K, which hasn’t been tested yet, while ANIS uses N.  
Either is acceptable, but let’s choose ASKIN first because it tests a new letter (K).

Therefore, the next guess is ASKIN.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (A _ _ _ _)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E is not in the word at all

So the pattern so far:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 2: Not R, not O, not E
- Position 3: Not O, not E
- Position 4: Not S (but S is somewhere else)
- Position 5: Not E

Letters we know are in the word: A, S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, E  

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S, and avoiding R, O, E.  
Good candidates:  
- ASKS (but repeats S)  
- ASTER (contains E)  
- ASCOT (contains O)  
- ACHES (contains E)  
- AGAST (has A twice, but valid)  
- ALOES (contains O and E)  
- ABASE (contains E)  
- ABASH (no E, no O, no R, contains S)

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ABASH → A(✓) B(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed again).
   - A appears again in position 3, but it’s marked “-” (wrong position), so the word does NOT have A in position 3.
   - B and H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A.
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, E, B, H.
- Does NOT have A in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S, avoiding positions 2, 3, 4, 5 for letters we’ve ruled out, and ensuring A is not in position 3.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E, B, H): A, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S is somewhere other than position 4. Let’s list words starting with A and containing S:

- A _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- A _ _ S _ (S in position 4 – but we know S is not in position 4, so skip)
- A _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- A S _ _ _ (S in position 2)

We need to check these patterns while avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Let’s try A _ S _ _ (S in position 3):
- A C S _ _ → ACSES? Not a word.
- A D S _ _ → ADS… no.
- A L S _ _ → ALS… no.
- A M S _ _ → AMS… no.

A S _ _ _ (S in position 2):
- A S C _ _ → ASCOT (has O, ruled out), ASCRA (has R), ASICS (has I, C, S – but S is already in position 2, and we need 5 unique letters? No, duplicates are allowed unless proven otherwise. ASICS is a word, but let’s see if it fits: A(✓) S(-) I _ C _ – but we don’t know about I, C yet. However, we know S is in the word, and ASICS has S in position 2, which is allowed. But we have no feedback on I or C yet. Let’s see if there’s a better word.

A _ _ _ S (S in position 5):
- A C I D S → ACIDS (A, C, I, D, S – all letters not ruled out, S in position 5, A in position 1. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.)
- A L I D S → ALIDS – not a word.
- A M I D S → AMIDS – not a word.

ACIDS seems like the best candidate here: starts with A, ends with S, avoids all ruled-out letters, and has S in position 5 (which is allowed since S is not in position 4).

Let’s verify:
- A(✓) C _ I _ D _ S – positions 2,3,4,5: C, I, D, S. None of these are ruled out except S must be in position 5, which is fine since S is confirmed in the word and not in position 4.
- No B, O, E, R, H in the word.
- A is not in position 3 (it’s in position 1), so that’s fine.

Therefore, ACIDS is a valid next guess.

- Does NOT contain: R, O, E, B, H, C, D.

Letters still allowed: A, I, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and I, with S not in position 4 and I not in position 3.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (since 4 is excluded).
Possible positions for I: 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is excluded).

Let’s list possible patterns:

- A S _ I _ (S in 2, I in 4)
- A S I _ _ (S in 2, I in 3 – but I can’t be in 3) – invalid
- A _ S I _ (S in 3, I in 4)
- A _ I S _ (S in 4 – invalid)
- A _ _ S I (S in 4 – invalid)
- A _ _ I S (S in 5)
- A I _ _ S (S in 5)
- A I _ S _ (S in 4 – invalid)
- A I S _ _ (S in 3, I in 2)

So valid patterns:
1. A S _ I _
2. A _ S I _
3. A _ _ I S
4. A I _ _ S
5. A I S _ _

Let’s check each pattern for possible words using allowed letters.

1. A S _ I _
   - ASKIN – but N is allowed, K is allowed. ASKIN is a word (variant of “askew” or surname). Let’s see: A(✓) S(-) K _ I _ – but we need to check if K and N are allowed (yes). ASKIN fits: A, S, I, K, N. No forbidden letters. S is in position 2 (allowed), I is in position 4 (allowed).

2. A _ S I _
   - A M S I _ – AMSI… no.
   - A L S I _ – ALSI… no.
   - A F S I _ – ASF… no.

3. A _ _ I S
   - A L I S – ALI is 3 letters, need 5.
   - A M I S – AMIS (plural of amie, valid word). A M I S – positions: A(✓) M _ I S. S is in 5 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed). No forbidden letters.

4. A I _ _ S
   - A I _ _ S – need two letters between I and S. Possible: A I N T S – AINTS (not a word), A I L T S – AILTS (not a word), A I L S _ – but S is in 5. A I G S – AIGS… no.

5. A I S _ _
   - A I S _ _ – S is in 3 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed). Possible: A I S _ _ – AIS… no.

Between the valid options, ASKIN and AMIS both fit. AMIS is simpler and uses more common letters. Let’s choose AMIS.

Check AMIS:
- A(✓) M _ I S
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S is not in 4).
- I is in position 4 (allowed, since I is not in 3).
- Letters: A, M, I, S. No forbidden letters (R, O, E, B, H, C, D).

Therefore, AMIS is a valid next guess.

<|im_end|>

The feedback for Guess 4 (AMIS) says: “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means **AMIS is not a valid 5-letter word** in the target language or dictionary used by the game.  
We must therefore pick a different word that still satisfies all the constraints we’ve gathered so far.

Recap of constraints:
- Starts with A.
- Contains both S and I.
- S is **not** in position 4.
- I is **not** in position 3.
- Excludes: R, O, E, B, H, C, D.

Allowed letters: A, I, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter word that fits these rules.

Valid patterns we identified earlier:
1. A S _ I _
2. A _ S I _
3. A _ _ I S
4. A I _ _ S
5. A I S _ _

Let’s re-examine each pattern with the corrected understanding that AMIS is invalid.

1. A S _ I _
   - ASKIN is a valid 5-letter word (variant of “askew” or surname).  
     Letters: A, S, K, I, N – none are excluded.  
     Positions: S in 2 (allowed), I in 4 (allowed).  
     This fits every rule.

2. A _ S I _
   - No common 5-letter words fit here (e.g., A F S I _ → ASF… not a word).

3. A _ _ I S
   - A M I S → AMIS was rejected.  
   - A L I S → ALI is 3 letters.  
   - A N I S → ANIS is a word (variant of “anise”).  
     Letters: A, N, I, S – all allowed.  
     Positions: I in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).  
     ANIS is valid.

4. A I _ _ S
   - No common 5-letter words fit here.

5. A I S _ _
   - AIS… no valid 5-letter words.

Between ASKIN and ANIS, both fit perfectly.  
ASKIN uses K, which hasn’t been tested yet, while ANIS uses N.  
Either is acceptable, but let’s choose ASKIN first because it tests a new letter (K).

Therefore, the next guess is ASKIN.
