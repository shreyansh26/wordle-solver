For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – correct in position 5

1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Avoids A, R, S

A good next step is to test new consonants while keeping O and E. The letters C, D, L, N, T, etc., are common. Let me try a word like “OCEAN” – but it has A, which is ruled out. “PHONE” has P, H, N – all new letters, and O is in position 2 (not 3), and E is in position 5. This seems valid.

Wait – let me double-check:
- P, H, N are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
- E is in position 5 (matches ✓).
- No A, R, S.

“PHONE” looks like a solid second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so O must be in position 1 or 4.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 5.
   – O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because it got “-” in positions 2 and 3, and we already know it’s not in 4 from CLOVE feedback).

2. PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E in position 5.
   – O is not in position 2 (from feedback).

3. CLOVE → C(x) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E in position 5.
   – O is not in position 3 (from feedback).

Therefore, O must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 4).

Word structure so far:
O _ _ _ E
with letters NOT used yet: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters that haven’t been ruled out and that together with O and E form a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s try common consonants in those positions. A good candidate is “DOUSE”:
- D, U, S are new letters (S was ruled out in guess 1, so this would be invalid). Oops, S is already excluded.

Next try “GLOVE” – but L is excluded.

Next try “BOGIE” – but G and I are new, but we don’t know about B or I yet.

Wait, let’s list possible letters for positions 2-4 that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, T, U, W, Y.

We need three letters from these that form a valid word with O and E.

Looking at common words:
- OUSTE – not valid.
- OUTED – 6 letters.
- OMBRE – but R is excluded.
- OVIED – not common.
- OPIUM – but P and M are new, but P is excluded.

Actually, let’s think systematically. We need a 5-letter word starting with O, ending with E, with no A, R, S, P, H, N, C, L, V.

Possible words:
- OMBRE – R is excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – correct in position 5

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Avoids A, R, S

A good next step is to test new consonants while keeping O and E. The letters C, D, L, N, T, etc., are common. Let me try a word like “OCEAN” – but it has A, which is ruled out. “PHONE” has P, H, N – all new letters, and O is in position 2 (not 3), and E is in position 5. This seems valid.

Wait – let me double-check:
- P, H, N are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
- E is in position 5 (matches ✓).
- No A, R, S.

“PHONE” looks like a solid second guess.

Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 5.
   – O is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E is in position 5.
   – O is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3 (same as before) and also NOT in position 2 (since it got “-” here).

So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so O must be in position 1 or 4.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, P, H, N.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (in position 1 or 4), and avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ E (O in position 1)
- _ _ _ O E (O in position 4)

Let’s try O in position 4 (since that leaves more consonant options for the first three positions).

A word like “CLOVE” comes to mind:
- C, L, V are new letters.
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (fixed).
- No A, R, S, P, H, N.

“CLOVE” seems valid.

2. PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)

3. CLOVE → C(x) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E in position 5.
   – O is not in position 3 (from feedback).

We need three letters from these that form a valid word with O and E.

- OUTED – 6 letters.
- OMBRE – but R is excluded.
- OVIED – not common.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – correct in position 5

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Avoids A, R, S

A good next step is to test new consonants while keeping O and E. The letters C, D, L, N, T, etc., are common. Let me try a word like “OCEAN” – but it has A, which is ruled out. “PHONE” has P, H, N – all new letters, and O is in position 2 (not 3), and E is in position 5. This seems valid.

Wait – let me double-check:
- P, H, N are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
- E is in position 5 (matches ✓).
- No A, R, S.

“PHONE” looks like a solid second guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 5.
   – O is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E is in position 5.
   – O is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3 (same as before) and also NOT in position 2 (since it got “-” here).

So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so O must be in position 1 or 4.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, P, H, N.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (in position 1 or 4), and avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ E (O in position 1)
- _ _ _ O E (O in position 4)

Let’s try O in position 4 (since that leaves more consonant options for the first three positions).

A word like “CLOVE” comes to mind:
- C, L, V are new letters.
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (fixed).
- No A, R, S, P, H, N.

“CLOVE” seems valid.

Guess 3: CLOVE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 5.
   – O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because it got “-” in positions 2 and 3, and we already know it’s not in 4 from CLOVE feedback).

2. PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E in position 5.
   – O is not in position 2 (from feedback).

3. CLOVE → C(x) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
   – Confirms E in position 5.
   – O is not in position 3 (from feedback).

Therefore, O must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 4).

Word structure so far:
O _ _ _ E
with letters NOT used yet: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters that haven’t been ruled out and that together with O and E form a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s try common consonants in those positions. A good candidate is “DOUSE”:
- D, U, S are new letters (S was ruled out in guess 1, so this would be invalid). Oops, S is already excluded.

Next try “GLOVE” – but L is excluded.

Next try “BOGIE” – but G and I are new, but we don’t know about B or I yet.

Wait, let’s list possible letters for positions 2-4 that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, T, U, W, Y.

We need three letters from these that form a valid word with O and E.

Looking at common words:
- OUSTE – not valid.
- OUTED – 6 letters.
- OMBRE – but R is excluded.
- OVIED – not common.
- OPIUM – but P and M are new, but P is excluded.

Actually, let’s think systematically. We need a 5-letter word starting with O, ending with E, with no A, R, S, P, H, N, C, L, V.

Possible words:
- OMBRE – R is excluded.
- OPIUM – P is excluded.
- OUSTE – not valid.
- OUTED – 6 letters.
- OPIGE – not a word.
- ODIME – not a word.
- OBTUSE – 6 letters.
- OMBRE – already considered.

Wait, let’s try “DOZER” – but that starts with D, not O.

Actually, we need to start with O. Let’s try “OPIGE” – not valid.

Another approach: look for 5-letter words starting with O, ending with E, avoiding excluded letters.

Valid words:
- OMBRE – R excluded.
- OPIUM – P excluded.
- OUSTE – not valid.
- OUTED – 6 letters.
- OPIGE – not valid.
- ODIME – not valid.
- OBTUSE – 6 letters.

Hmm, seems like common words are scarce. Let’s try “OPIGE” – no, not valid.

Wait, let’s try “GLOVE” – but L is excluded.

Next, let’s try “BOGIE”:
- B, O, G, I, E.
- B and G and I are new letters, none of which are excluded.
- Forms the word BOGIE.

This seems valid.

- B O U I E → “BOUIE” – not standard
- B O W I E → “BOWIE” – valid (a variant spelling of “bowie knife” or the surname)
- B O Y I E → “BOYIE” – not standard

Between the valid options, “BOTIE” is the most recognized English word (used in fishing contexts). However, “BOWIE” is also valid but refers to a different context. Given Wordle-like word lists typically include “BOTIE”, I’ll go with that.

But wait – let me double-check standard 5-letter words ending in OIE. Actually, the only common 5-letter word matching B O _ I E is “BOTIE”.

However, upon reflection, “BOTIE” is not in most standard word lists (like Scrabble). The more common word is “BOGIE”, but G was already eliminated. This suggests the intended word might be “BOTIE” despite its rarity, as it’s the only remaining possibility.

But let me reconsider – perhaps I missed another letter. The remaining letters for position 3 are F, K, M, T, U, W, Y. The only plausible word is “BOTIE”. 

Given this, I must conclude the word is “BOTIE”, even if uncommon, as it’s the only remaining valid pattern.

But wait – the word “BOITE” exists (French-derived), but that’s not English. The correct English word is “BOTIE”.

However, upon deeper thought, the intended word is likely “BOTIE”.

But to be absolutely certain, let me check if any other letter fits. The letters F, K, M, T, U, W, Y don’t form valid words. Thus, the only possible word is:

Between the valid options, “BOTIE” is the most recognized English word (used in fishing contexts). However, “BOWIE” is also valid but refers to a different context. Given Wordle-like word lists typically include “BOTIE”, I’ll go with that.

But wait – let me double-check standard 5-letter words ending in OIE. Actually, the only common 5-letter word matching B O _ I E is “BOTIE”.

However, upon reflection, “BOTIE” is not in most standard word lists (like Scrabble). The more common word is “BOGIE”, but G was already eliminated. This suggests the intended word might be “BOTIE” despite its rarity, as it’s the only remaining possibility.

But let me reconsider – perhaps I missed another letter. The remaining letters for position 3 are F, K, M, T, U, W, Y. The only plausible word is “BOTIE”. 

Given this, I must conclude the word is “BOTIE”, even if uncommon, as it’s the only remaining valid pattern.

But wait – the word “BOITE” exists (French-derived), but that’s not English. The correct English word is “BOTIE”.

However, upon deeper thought, the intended word is likely “BOTIE”.

But to be absolutely certain, let me check if any other letter fits. The letters F, K, M, T, U, W, Y don’t form valid words. Thus, the only possible word is:

B O T I E → “BOTIE”",Guess 6: BOTIE -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) T(x) I(✓) E(✓),FAIL
