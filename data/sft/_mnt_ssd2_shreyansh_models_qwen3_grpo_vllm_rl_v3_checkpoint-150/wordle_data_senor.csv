### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates to cover more letters.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S (very common in 5-letter words), L, A, T, and E (the most common letter in English). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in first position (✓)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is not in position 5
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Contains E, but not in position 5
- Does NOT contain L, A, T

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1
2. Try to place E in positions 2-4
3. Introduce new common letters (R, I, N, O, C, etc.) that haven’t been tested yet

Good candidates:
- SIREN (S ✓, I, R, E, N) – E in position 4
- SINCE (S ✓, I, N, C, E) – E in position 5 (but we know E isn’t in 5) – discard
- SHIRE (S ✓, H, I, R, E) – E in position 5 – discard
- STONE (S ✓, T, O, N, E) – T already ruled out
- SPRIG (S ✓, P, R, I, G) – no E

Let’s summarize the new information from SIREN:

- S ✓ (position 1 confirmed)
- I x → I is not in the word
- R - → R is in the word but not in position 3
- E - → E is in the word but not in position 4
- N - → N is in the word but not in position 5

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

Letters we now know are in the word: S, R, E, N  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, I

We still need to place:
- R somewhere other than position 3
- E somewhere other than positions 4 or 5
- N somewhere other than position 5

Possible positions for E: 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are ruled out)  
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, or 4  
Possible positions for R: 2, 4, or 5 (but 3 is excluded)

Also, we haven’t tested O, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. We should introduce a new common letter that hasn’t appeared yet.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1
2. Try to place E in position 2 or 3
3. Try to place N and R in remaining valid spots
4. Introduce a new common letter (e.g., O, U, C, etc.)

Let’s try:
- E in position 2
- N in position 3 or 4
- R in position 4 or 5
- Add a new letter (e.g., O)

Candidate words:
- S E N R _ → need a 5th letter, but R can’t be in 5 (no restriction, but N would be in 3)
- S E _ N R → E in 2, N in 4, R in 5 (valid)
- S E R N _ → E in 2, R in 3 (but R can’t be in 3 from SIREN feedback) → invalid
- S _ E N R → E in 3, N in 4, R in 5 (valid)

The word “SENOR” fits:
- S ✓ (position 1)
- E in position 2
- N in position 3
- O is a new letter
- R in position 5

This tests:
- E in position 2
- N in position 3
- R in position 5 (valid, since R only couldn’t be in 3)
- Introduces O
