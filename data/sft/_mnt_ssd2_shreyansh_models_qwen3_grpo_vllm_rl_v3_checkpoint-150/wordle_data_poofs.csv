- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. O is locked in position 3.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and SPOIL feedback).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from SPOIL feedback).  
   So P must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. Letters definitely absent: A, R, E, I, L.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has S in position 2 or 5.
- Has P somewhere other than position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try S in position 5 and P in position 1.  
That gives us: P _ O _ S.

We still need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T, W, Y.  
Common unused vowels: U (only vowel left).

A good choice is “POINT”:
- P in 1, O in 3, S not present – so let’s instead try “POUND” (but D is fine).  
Actually, let’s use “PONDS” – but S is already in 5.  
Better: “PONCY” (C and Y are unused).  
But let’s keep it simple: “PONDS” has D which is fine.

Wait, let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _.  
Then P could be in 1, 4, or 5.  
Try “PSYCH” – but H is fine, C and H unused.  
But let’s try “POSIT” – but I and T are fine, but I is ruled out.  
Try “PONDS” – D is fine, N is fine.

Actually let’s try “PONDS”:
- P (1), O (3), N (2), D (4), S (5).  
This uses P, O, S and new letters N, D.

But let’s check: P(-) in SPOIL meant P is in word but not in 2 – so P in 1 is fine.  
S(-) in SPOIL meant S is in word but not in 1 – so S in 5 is fine.  
O(✓) stays.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and already in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O in the 3rd position.
2. Includes S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Avoids A, R, E.
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"":
- S is moved to position 1.
- P and I are common consonants and vowels we haven't tested yet.
- O stays in position 3.
- L is another common consonant we haven't tried.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters efficiently.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. O is locked in position 3.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and SPOIL feedback).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from SPOIL feedback).  
   So P must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. Letters definitely absent: A, R, E, I, L.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has S in position 2 or 5.
- Has P somewhere other than position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try S in position 5 and P in position 1.  
That gives us: P _ O _ S.

We still need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T, W, Y.  
Common unused vowels: U (only vowel left).

A good choice is “POINT”:
- P in 1, O in 3, S not present – so let’s instead try “POUND” (but D is fine).  
Actually, let’s use “PONDS” – but S is already in 5.  
Better: “PONCY” (C and Y are unused).  
But let’s keep it simple: “PONDS” has D which is fine.

Wait, let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _.  
Then P could be in 1, 4, or 5.  
Try “PSYCH” – but H is fine, C and H unused.  
But let’s try “POSIT” – but I and T are fine, but I is ruled out.  
Try “PONDS” – D is fine, N is fine.

Actually let’s try “PONDS”:
- P (1), O (3), N (2), D (4), S (5).  
This uses P, O, S and new letters N, D.

But let’s check: P(-) in SPOIL meant P is in word but not in 2 – so P in 1 is fine.  
S(-) in SPOIL meant S is in word but not in 1 – so S in 5 is fine.  
O(✓) stays.  
N and D are new.

This seems valid.

This is getting frustrating. Let me step back and think of actual 5-letter words that fit P _ O _ S.

Possible words:
- POKES – but E is out.
- POKYS – Y is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.
- POUCH – but U is out.
- POCKS – C and K are allowed.
- POGIS – but I is out.
- POLES – E and L are out.
- POLKS – L is out.
- POKES – E is out.
- POKYS – Y is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.
- POGIS – I is out.
- POKES – E is out.
- POKYS – seems like a valid word (slang for poky).
- POCKS – valid word.
- POKYS – valid word.

Let me try POCKS:
- P(1), O(3), C(2), K(4), S(5)
- Letters used: P, O, C, K, S
- All letters are allowed (C and K haven't been ruled out).

This seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

</think>

<guess>POCKS</guess>",POCKS,"From the latest feedback on POUMS:

- P(✓) – confirmed in position 1.
- O(✓) – confirmed in position 3.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern is still: P _ O _ S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, I, L, N, D, U, M

Available letters for positions 2 and 4:  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, T, W, Y  
Vowels: none left (only vowel was O, which is already placed)

We need two consonants to fill positions 2 and 4.

- Position 2: B, C, F, G, H, K, T, W, Y
- Position 4: same list, different from position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and already in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O in the 3rd position.
2. Includes S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Avoids A, R, E.
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"":
- S is moved to position 1.
- P and I are common consonants and vowels we haven't tested yet.
- O stays in position 3.
- L is another common consonant we haven't tried.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. O is locked in position 3.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and SPOIL feedback).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from SPOIL feedback).  
   So P must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. Letters definitely absent: A, R, E, I, L.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has S in position 2 or 5.
- Has P somewhere other than position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try S in position 5 and P in position 1.  
That gives us: P _ O _ S.

We still need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T, W, Y.  
Common unused vowels: U (only vowel left).

A good choice is “POINT”:
- P in 1, O in 3, S not present – so let’s instead try “POUND” (but D is fine).  
Actually, let’s use “PONDS” – but S is already in 5.  
Better: “PONCY” (C and Y are unused).  
But let’s keep it simple: “PONDS” has D which is fine.

Wait, let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _.  
Then P could be in 1, 4, or 5.  
Try “PSYCH” – but H is fine, C and H unused.  
But let’s try “POSIT” – but I and T are fine, but I is ruled out.  
Try “PONDS” – D is fine, N is fine.

Actually let’s try “PONDS”:
- P (1), O (3), N (2), D (4), S (5).  
This uses P, O, S and new letters N, D.

But let’s check: P(-) in SPOIL meant P is in word but not in 2 – so P in 1 is fine.  
S(-) in SPOIL meant S is in word but not in 1 – so S in 5 is fine.  
O(✓) stays.  
N and D are new.

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: PONDS -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) N(x) D(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PONDS:

- P(✓) – P is in the word and already in the correct position (1st letter).
- O(✓) – O is in the word and already in the correct position (3rd letter).
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and already in the correct position (5th letter).

So we now know the word pattern is:

P _ O _ S

Letters already confirmed: P, O, S in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, I, L, N, D.

We still need two letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Available common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, T, W, Y  
Available vowels: U (only vowel left)

Let’s pick common letters that fit.  
Position 2: consonant  
Position 4: consonant  

A good candidate is “POUCH”:
- P(1), O(3), U(2), C(4), H(5) – but S must be in 5, so this is invalid.

Let’s try “POINT” – but I is ruled out.

Let’s try “POCKS” – but K and C are fine, but S must be in 5.

Let’s try “POKES” – but E is ruled out.

Let’s try “POUMS” – but M and U are fine.

Let’s try “POWER” – but E and R are ruled out.

Let’s try “POEMS” – but E is ruled out.

Let’s try “POGS” – but G and S are fine, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “POGSY” – too long.

Let’s try “POKES” – E is out.

Let’s try “POUCH” – but S must be in 5.

Let’s try “POUMS” – fits P _ O _ S: P O U M S.

Check letters: U and M are unused and valid.

This seems like the best next guess.

From the latest feedback on POUMS:

- P(✓) – confirmed in position 1.
- O(✓) – confirmed in position 3.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern is still: P _ O _ S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, I, L, N, D, U, M

Available letters for positions 2 and 4:  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, T, W, Y  
Vowels: none left (only vowel was O, which is already placed)

We need two consonants to fill positions 2 and 4.

Let’s try common combinations:
- Position 2: B, C, F, G, H, K, T, W, Y
- Position 4: same list, different from position 2

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me think differently – maybe the word is “P O _ _ S” with letters from the remaining pool.

This is getting frustrating. Let me step back and think of actual 5-letter words that fit P _ O _ S.

Possible words:
- POKES – but E is out.
- POKYS – Y is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.
- POUCH – but U is out.
- POCKS – C and K are allowed.
- POGIS – but I is out.
- POLES – E and L are out.
- POLKS – L is out.
- POKES – E is out.
- POKYS – Y is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.
- POGIS – I is out.
- POKES – E is out.
- POKYS – seems like a valid word (slang for poky).
- POCKS – valid word.
- POKYS – valid word.

Let me try POCKS:
- P(1), O(3), C(2), K(4), S(5)
- Letters used: P, O, C, K, S
- All letters are allowed (C and K haven't been ruled out).

This seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

From the latest feedback on POCKS we now know:

- P(✓) – correct in position 1  
- O(✓) – correct in position 3  
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word  
- K(x) – K is NOT in the word  
- S(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the pattern is still: P _ O _ S, but the letters C and K are ruled out.

Letters already ruled out in positions 2 and 4:  
- From POCKS: C, K  
- From previous guesses: N, D, U, M, B, F, G, H, T, W, Y (none of these were in the word, so they’re all out)  

Wait, no: the ruled-out letters are only those that have been marked “x” in any feedback.  
So far we have: A, R, E, I, L, N, D, U, M, C, K are all ruled out.

That leaves only one possible consonant for positions 2 and 4: G and H (from earlier lists).  
But both G and H have not been tried yet.

Looking at the pattern P _ O _ S, and the remaining letters, the only valid English word that fits is:

P G O H S  → “PHOGS” is not a word.  
P H O G S  → “PHOGS” is not a word.  
P G O H S  → not valid.  
P H O G S  → not valid.

Wait, let me list actual 5-letter words that fit P _ O _ S and use only allowed letters.

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 4: G, H (since all others have been ruled out).

Possible combinations:
- P G O H S → “PHOGS” – invalid word.  
- P H O G S – invalid word.  

But there is one valid word: “POGGS” – but G is allowed and S is fixed at 5.  
However, “POGGS” uses G in position 2 and 4, but position 4 would be G and position 2 would be G – but that would be P G O G S, which is invalid because letters cannot repeat unless confirmed.  

Wait, let me think again. The only remaining consonants are G and H.  
The word must be P _ O _ S.

The only valid English word that fits is “POGGS” – but that has G in positions 2 and 4, which is allowed if G can appear twice.  
However, “POGGS” is a valid word (slang for poggers).

But let me check if G has been ruled out. No, G has never been marked “x” in any feedback, so it’s allowed.

Thus, the only remaining candidate is “POGGS”.

Let me verify:
- P(1) ✓, O(3) ✓, S(5) ✓  
- G(2) and G(4) – never ruled out, so allowed  
- All other letters ruled out.

Therefore, the correct word must be “POGGS”.
