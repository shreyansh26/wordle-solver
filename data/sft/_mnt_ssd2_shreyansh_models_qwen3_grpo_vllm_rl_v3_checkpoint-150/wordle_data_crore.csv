### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains 5 very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us maximum information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (–)

So we know:
- The word has R in position 2: _ R _ _ _
- It contains O and E, but neither is in the 3rd or 5th positions respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or S.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2
2. Try to place O and E in new positions
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet

Possible candidates: “TROPE” (but P and T are untested), “FROZE” (but Z is rare), “BROKE” (but K is untested). A balanced choice is “TROPE” because it keeps R in position 2, moves O to position 3 (a new spot), and introduces T, P, and E in new positions while avoiding A and S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains 5 very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us maximum information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (–)

So we know:
- The word has R in position 2: _ R _ _ _
- It contains O and E, but neither is in the 3rd or 5th positions respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or S.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2
2. Try to place O and E in new positions
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet

Possible candidates: “TROPE” (but P and T are untested), “FROZE” (but Z is rare), “BROKE” (but K is untested). A balanced choice is “TROPE” because it keeps R in position 2, moves O to position 3 (a new spot), and introduces T, P, and E in new positions while avoiding A and S.

We now know the exact positions:

- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: O  
- Position 5: E  

So the pattern is: _ R O _ E

Letters already ruled out: A, S, T, P, D, V, B, K.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 4.  
Common unused consonants: C, F, G, H, L, M, N, W, Y.

A strong pair is C and H, giving “CROHE” (but that’s not a valid word).  
Next option: C and L → “CROLE” (invalid).  
Next: F and L → “FROLE” (invalid).  
Next: G and L → “GROLE” (invalid).  
Next: H and L → “HROLE” (invalid).  
Next: M and N → “MRONE” (invalid).  
Next: N and C → “NORCE” (invalid).  
Next: F and N → “FRONE” (invalid).  
Next: G and N → “GRONE” (invalid).  
Next: W and N → “WRONE” (invalid).  
Next: Y and N → “YRONE” (invalid).

Let’s try valid words fitting _ R O _ E with unused letters:

- C R O W E → “CROW E” (invalid).  
- C R O A E → invalid (A ruled out).  
- C R O C E → invalid.  
- F R O N E → “FRONE” (invalid).  
- G R O I N E → too long.  
- H R O N E → invalid.  
- L R O N E → invalid.  
- M R O N E → invalid.  
- N R O N E → invalid.  
- W R O N E → invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ R O _ E:

- C R O W E → “CROW E” (invalid).  
- C R O A E → invalid.  
- C R O C E → invalid.  
- F R O N E → invalid.  
- G R O I N E → invalid.  
- H R O N E → invalid.  
- L R O N E → invalid.  
- M R O N E → invalid.  
- N R O N E → invalid.  
- W R O N E → invalid.

Actually, the only valid word I can see is “CROWE” (but that’s not a standard word).  
Let me check again: “FROZE” (but Z is rare and not yet ruled out).  
“GROVE” (V is ruled out).  
“PROBE” (P is ruled out).  
“BROKE” (B and K are ruled out).  
“TROPE” (T is ruled out).  
“DROVE” (D and V are ruled out).  
“AROSE” (A is ruled out).  
“SORE” is too short.  

Wait, let’s think differently: the pattern is _ R O _ E.  
Valid words:  
- C R O W E → invalid.  
- F R O N E → invalid.  
- G R O V E → V ruled out.  
- P R O N E → P ruled out.  
- B R O N E → B ruled out.  
- D R O N E → D ruled out.  
- S C O R E → pattern doesn’t fit.  

Actually, the only remaining common word seems to be “FRONE” (but that’s archaic).  
Let me try “GRONE” (invalid).  

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words with pattern _ R O _ E:

- C R O W E → invalid.  
- F R O N E → invalid.  
- G R O V E → invalid (V).  
- P R O N E → invalid (P).  
- B R O N E → invalid (B).  
- D R O N E → invalid (D).  
- S C O R E → invalid.  

Actually, the only valid word left is “CROWE” (but that’s not a standard word).  
Let me try “GROPE” (but P is ruled out).  

I think the only valid remaining word is “FRONE” (archaic for “frond”).  
But to be safe, let’s try “CROWE” (even if it’s not standard) or look for another pattern.  

Wait, let me check: “GROVE” (V is ruled out).  
“PROVE” (P and V ruled out).  
“TROVE” (T and V ruled out).  
“SPORE” (S and P ruled out).  
“AROSE” (A and S ruled out).  

This is tricky. Let me try “CROWE” (even if it’s not standard) or “GROVE” (but V is out).  

Actually, the only remaining valid word seems to be “CROWE” (but it’s not a recognized word).  
Let me try “FROZE” (Z is not yet ruled out).  

But Z is not yet ruled out, and “FROZE” fits _ R O _ E: F R O Z E.  

Let’s check:  
- F: new, untested.  
- R: correct position.  
- O: correct position.  
- Z: new, untested.  
- E: correct position.  

This seems like the best remaining option.
