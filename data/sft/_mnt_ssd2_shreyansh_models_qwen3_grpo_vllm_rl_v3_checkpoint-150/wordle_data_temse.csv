For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these.

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters and cover vowels and consonants. This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the word ends in S and contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position. We also know A, R, O are excluded.

Good next steps:
1. Keep S in the 5th position.
2. Include E in one of positions 1-4.
3. Avoid A, R, O.
4. Try common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

   - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

2. STEPS → S(-) T(-) E(-) P(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in the 1st position (so the last position must be S, which matches round 1).
   - T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the word but not in the 3rd position (and we already know not in 5th).
   - P is not in the word.

Possible candidates:

- STEMS – but E is in 3rd place (invalid), and M not yet tested.

- STONE – O excluded.
- STEIN – ends in N, not S.
- STEPS – already tried.
- STEAKS – A excluded.
- STEMS – E in 3rd invalid.
- STEWS – E in 3rd invalid.

- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains E (in 2nd position, which is allowed since E is not restricted to any position except not 5th).
- Contains T (in 3rd position, which is allowed since T is only restricted from 2nd position).
- No A, R, O, P.

But wait, in STEPS feedback, E was in 3rd position and marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in 3rd position. So E could be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Let’s try a word with E in 2nd position and T in 1st or 4th:
- TESLA – A excluded.
- TENTS – ends in S, contains E (2nd), T (1st), N (3rd). No A, R, O, P. This seems valid.

Check:

- Contains T (in 3rd position, which is allowed since T is only restricted from 2nd position).
- No A, R, O, P.

But wait, in STEPS feedback, E was in 3rd position and marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in 3rd position. So E could be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Let’s try a word with E in 2nd position and T in 1st or 4th:
- TESLA – A excluded.
- TENTS – ends in S, contains E (2nd), T (1st), N (3rd). No A, R, O, P. This seems valid.

Check:
- TENTS: T(✓) E(-) N(-) T(-) S(✓)
   - T in 1st position: allowed (T is in word, not restricted from 1st).
   - E in 2nd position: allowed (E is in word, not restricted from 2nd).
   - N: new letter, not yet tested.
   - T in 4th position: allowed (T is in word, not restricted from 4th).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these.

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters and cover vowels and consonants. This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the word ends in S and contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position. We also know A, R, O are excluded.

Good next steps:
1. Keep S in the 5th position.
2. Include E in one of positions 1-4.
3. Avoid A, R, O.
4. Try common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates: 
- STENS (but double S unlikely)
- SENTO (but O is excluded)
- STEMS (but M might be too restrictive)
- STONE (but O is excluded)
- STEPS (but P might be too restrictive)

""STEPS"" uses S (fixed), T, E, P, S. It keeps S at the end and moves E to position 3, while introducing T and P which are common. It also avoids A, R, O.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word and is in the correct position (last letter).
   - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

2. STEPS → S(-) T(-) E(-) P(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in the 1st position (so the last position must be S, which matches round 1).
   - T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the word but not in the 3rd position (and we already know not in 5th).
   - P is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Contains T somewhere, but not in position 2.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, P.

Letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing E and T, with no A, R, O, P.

Possible candidates:
- TESTS – but E is in position 2, T in 3, but T can’t be in 2nd place (from feedback). Also double T unlikely.
- STEMS – but E is in 3rd place (invalid), and M not yet tested.
- STETS – double T and double E, positions unclear.
- STEWS – no E in 3rd, but E in 3rd is invalid.
- STICKS – no E.
- STONE – O excluded.
- STEIN – ends in N, not S.
- STEPS – already tried.
- STEAKS – A excluded.
- STEMS – E in 3rd invalid.
- STEWS – E in 3rd invalid.

Looking at remaining possibilities, let’s try “STEWS”:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains E (in 2nd position, which is allowed since E is not restricted to any position except not 5th).
- Contains T (in 3rd position, which is allowed since T is only restricted from 2nd position).
- No A, R, O, P.

But wait, in STEPS feedback, E was in 3rd position and marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in 3rd position. So E could be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Let’s try a word with E in 2nd position and T in 1st or 4th:
- TESLA – A excluded.
- TENTS – ends in S, contains E (2nd), T (1st), N (3rd). No A, R, O, P. This seems valid.

Check:
- TENTS: T(✓) E(-) N(-) T(-) S(✓)
   - T in 1st position: allowed (T is in word, not restricted from 1st).
   - E in 2nd position: allowed (E is in word, not restricted from 2nd).
   - N: new letter, not yet tested.
   - T in 4th position: allowed (T is in word, not restricted from 4th).

Let’s list all the constraints we now have.

Letters known to be in the word:
- S – must be in position 5 (from AROSE and confirmed by TENTS, TESTS).
- T – must be in position 1 or 3 (T is in word, but not in positions 2,4,5).
- E – must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (E is in word, but not in positions 3,5).

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, P, N, S (but S is fixed at 5), T (only in 1 or 3), E (only in 1,2,4).

So the word has the form:
_ _ _ _ S
with S fixed at position 5.

Possible positions for T and E:
1. T in 1, E in 2 or 4 → T E _ _ S or T _ E _ S
2. T in 3, E in 1 or 2 or 4 → E _ T _ S, _ E T _ S, _ _ T E S

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill the blanks with these letters, avoiding duplicates of T, E, S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these.

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters and cover vowels and consonants. This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the word ends in S and contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position. We also know A, R, O are excluded.

Good next steps:
1. Keep S in the 5th position.
2. Include E in one of positions 1-4.
3. Avoid A, R, O.
4. Try common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates: 
- STENS (but double S unlikely)
- SENTO (but O is excluded)
- STEMS (but M might be too restrictive)
- STONE (but O is excluded)
- STEPS (but P might be too restrictive)

""STEPS"" uses S (fixed), T, E, P, S. It keeps S at the end and moves E to position 3, while introducing T and P which are common. It also avoids A, R, O.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word and is in the correct position (last letter).
   - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

2. STEPS → S(-) T(-) E(-) P(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in the 1st position (so the last position must be S, which matches round 1).
   - T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the word but not in the 3rd position (and we already know not in 5th).
   - P is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Contains T somewhere, but not in position 2.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, P.

Letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing E and T, with no A, R, O, P.

Possible candidates:
- TESTS – but E is in position 2, T in 3, but T can’t be in 2nd place (from feedback). Also double T unlikely.
- STEMS – but E is in 3rd place (invalid), and M not yet tested.
- STETS – double T and double E, positions unclear.
- STEWS – no E in 3rd, but E in 3rd is invalid.
- STICKS – no E.
- STONE – O excluded.
- STEIN – ends in N, not S.
- STEPS – already tried.
- STEAKS – A excluded.
- STEMS – E in 3rd invalid.
- STEWS – E in 3rd invalid.

Looking at remaining possibilities, let’s try “STEWS”:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains E (in 2nd position, which is allowed since E is not restricted to any position except not 5th).
- Contains T (in 3rd position, which is allowed since T is only restricted from 2nd position).
- No A, R, O, P.

But wait, in STEPS feedback, E was in 3rd position and marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in 3rd position. So E could be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

Let’s try a word with E in 2nd position and T in 1st or 4th:
- TESLA – A excluded.
- TENTS – ends in S, contains E (2nd), T (1st), N (3rd). No A, R, O, P. This seems valid.

Check:
- TENTS: T(✓) E(-) N(-) T(-) S(✓)
   - T in 1st position: allowed (T is in word, not restricted from 1st).
   - E in 2nd position: allowed (E is in word, not restricted from 2nd).
   - N: new letter, not yet tested.
   - T in 4th position: allowed (T is in word, not restricted from 4th).
   - S in 5th: ✓.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts
- Word ends with S (from AROSE and confirmed by TENTS).
- Contains E somewhere, but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5 (from STEPS and TENTS feedback).
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Contains T somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (from STEPS and TENTS feedback).
  ⇒ T must be in position 1 or 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, P, N.

Letters still allowed (excluding the forbidden ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Structure so far
Position 5 is S.

Case 1: E in position 1
Then word looks like E _ _ _ S
T must be in position 3: E _ T _ S

Case 2: E in position 2
Then word looks like _ E _ _ S
T must be in position 1 or 3:
  - If T in 1: T E _ _ S
  - If T in 3: _ E T _ S

We need to fill the remaining blanks with allowed letters and ensure no duplicates of already confirmed letters (none so far).

Candidate words:
- Case 1: E _ T _ S → ETCHS (invalid, no such word), EFTIS (invalid), EMITS (valid word, ends in S, contains E and T, no forbidden letters)
- Case 2a: T E _ _ S → TESLA (A forbidden), TENTS (N forbidden), TETES (invalid), TESTS (double T, but allowed letters)
- Case 2b: _ E T _ S → METTS (invalid), LETTS (invalid), BETTS (invalid), GETTS (invalid), HETTS (invalid), VETTS (invalid), YETTS (invalid)

The only valid word among these is EMITS.

Check:
- EMITS: E(✓) M(-) I(-) T(-) S(✓)
  - E in 1st: allowed.
  - T in 4th: allowed (T is in word, only restricted from 2,4,5 in previous feedback? Wait, TENTS showed T in 4th as (-), meaning T is NOT in 4th position. So T must be in 1st or 3rd.
  - EMITS has T in 4th → invalid.

Re-examine:
From TENTS: T(-) in 4th ⇒ T is NOT in 4th ⇒ T must be in 1st or 3rd.

Valid candidates:
- Case 1: E _ T _ S → EFTIS (invalid), EMITS (T in 4th invalid), ECTIS (invalid)
- Case 2a: T E _ _ S → TESTS (T in 1st, E in 2nd, S in 5th, no forbidden letters, T in 1st allowed, E in 2nd allowed)
- Case 2b: _ E T _ S → CETYS (invalid), DETS (invalid), GETS (invalid), LETS (invalid), METS (invalid), YETS (invalid)

The only valid word is TESTS.

Check TESTS:
- T(✓) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)
  - T in 1st: allowed (T is in word, only restricted from 2,4,5).
  - E in 2nd: allowed (E is in word, only restricted from 3,4,5).
  - S in 5th: ✓.
  - Additional T in 4th: allowed (no restriction on extra Ts).

   - CITES – I,T,E,S – valid word, but T is in 3rd position (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), no forbidden letters.
   - DITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - FITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - GITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - HITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - LITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - VITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - WITES – I,T,E,S – valid
   - YITES – invalid
   - ZITES – invalid

The most straightforward valid word is CITES (or DITES, FITES, etc.), but we should pick the one that introduces new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let’s choose CITES.

Check CITES:
C(?) I(?) T(✓) E(✓) S(✓)
- C and I are new, allowed letters.
- T in 3rd (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), S in 5th (fixed).
- No forbidden letters.

This is a strong candidate.

Let's update all constraints after the fifth guess.

Known letters and positions:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from AROSE and confirmed by every subsequent guess).
- T must be in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (from TENTS and CITES feedback).
  Therefore T must be in position 1 or 3.
- E must be in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5 (from STEPS, TENTS, CITES feedback).
  Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, P, N, C, I.

Word structure:
_ _ _ _ S
with S at 5.

Case 1: E in position 1
Then word is E _ _ _ S
T must be in position 3: E _ T _ S

Case 2: E in position 2
Then word is _ E _ _ S
T must be in position 1 or 3:
  - T E _ _ S
  - _ E T _ S

We need to fill the blanks with allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Candidate words:
- Case 1: E _ T _ S
