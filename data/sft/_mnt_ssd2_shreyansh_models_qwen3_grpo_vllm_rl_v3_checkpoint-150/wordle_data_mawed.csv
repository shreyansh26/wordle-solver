For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
- Contains A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and E in different positions.
2. Avoids S, L, T.
3. Introduces new common consonants to test.

Good candidates: CRANE, CHAIN, HEARD, etc.

I'll choose CRANE:
- C, R, N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so valid).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this is invalid).

Next option: HEARD
- H, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (valid).
- E is in position 4 (valid, since we only know E is not in position 5).

HEARD seems good.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
- Contains A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and E in different positions.
2. Avoids S, L, T.
3. Introduces new common consonants to test.

Good candidates: CRANE, CHAIN, HEARD, etc.

I'll choose CRANE:
- C, R, N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so valid).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this is invalid).

Next option: HEARD
- H, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (valid).
- E is in position 4 (valid, since we only know E is not in position 5).

HEARD seems good.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)

   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: A, E

2. HEARD → H(x) E(-) A(-) R(x) D(✓)
   - Letters NOT in the word: H, R
   - Letter in the word and correct position: D is in position 5
   - Letters in the word but wrong positions: E, A

So far we know:
- The word ends with D (position 5).
- It contains A and E, but:
   – A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from HEARD).
   – E is not in position 2 (from HEARD) and not in position 5 (from SLATE).
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, H, R.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, N, M, P, B, G, etc.
We need a 5-letter word ending in D, containing A and E in allowable positions.

Candidate words:
- CAED_ – but we need 5 letters.
- CAGED – ends in D, has A and E, but A is in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
  Check positions: C A G E D
  – A not in 3 (ok, it’s in 2)
  – E not in 2 or 5 (it’s in 4, ok)
  – D in 5 (matches ✓)
  – No S, L, T, H, R.

CAGED looks valid and follows all constraints.

   – A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from HEARD).
   – E is not in position 2 (from HEARD) and not in position 5 (from SLATE).
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, H, R.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, N, M, P, B, G, etc.
We need a 5-letter word ending in D, containing A and E in allowable positions.

Candidate words:
- CAED_ – but we need 5 letters.
- CAGED – ends in D, has A and E, but A is in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
  Check positions: C A G E D
  – A not in 3 (ok, it’s in 2)
  – E not in 2 or 5 (it’s in 4, ok)
  – D in 5 (matches ✓)
  – No S, L, T, H, R.

CAGED looks valid and follows all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HEARD -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) A(-) R(x) D(✓)
Guess 3: CAGED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) D(✓)

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - Absent letters: S, L, T
   - A and E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. HEARD → H(x) E(-) A(-) R(x) D(✓)
   - Absent letters add H, R
   - D is in position 5
   - E and A are in the word but wrong positions

3. CAGED → C(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) D(✓)
   - Absent letters add C, G
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - D is in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word is:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: D
- Letters not present: S, L, T, H, R, C, G
- Letters already placed: A, E, D
- Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 3 with letters not in the forbidden set.

Common consonants left to test: B, F, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern:
- _ A _ E D

Possible words:
- B A N E D
- M A N E D (but MANED is a valid word)
- V A N E D (rare)
- F A N E D (rare)
- W A N E D (rare)

The most common and valid word fitting the pattern is BANED.

Check:
- B: not in forbidden set
- A: in position 2 (✓)
- N: not in forbidden set
- E: in position 4 (✓)
- D: in position 5 (✓)

No forbidden letters are used.

From the four rounds we now have exact positions for three letters:

- Position 2 = A (✓)
- Position 4 = E (✓)
- Position 5 = D (✓)

Forbidden letters accumulated so far: S, L, T, H, R, C, G, B, N

Missing letters for positions 1 and 3 must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden set).  
Valid consonants left: F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, O, U (but we already have A and E placed; no indication other vowels are present).

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ A _ E D

Scanning common English words with that pattern:
- F A K E D – “FAKED” (past tense of fake)
- M A K E D – “MAKED” is not a valid word
- P A P E D – “PAPED” is rare
- V A K E D – not a word
- J A C K E D – too long
- W A K E D – “WAKED” is valid but W and K are allowed

Between “FAKED” and “WAKED”, “FAKED” uses F and K, both still allowed, and is a common word.

Check letters:
F – not forbidden  
A – correct position  
K – not forbidden  
E – correct position  
D – correct position  

No conflicts.

Quick scan:
- M A _ E D → M A K E D (invalid, K forbidden), M A N E D (N forbidden)  
- P A _ E D → P A P E D (valid, but P appears twice)  
- V A _ E D → V A K E D (K forbidden)  
- W A _ E D → W A K E D (K forbidden)  
- J A _ E D → J A C K E D (too long)  
- P A P E D is the only common word left that fits and uses allowed letters.

Check P: not in forbidden set.
