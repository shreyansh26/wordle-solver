For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters that are all common. Some good options include: STARE, AROSE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Excludes A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A strong next guess is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in the 4th position (different from 5th position in AROSE).
- Includes U and N (new letters).
- Excludes A, R, O, S.
- Tests T and I as additional letters.

Other options could be ""ELITE"", ""UNITY"", ""FIELD"", ""MELEE"", etc., but ""UNTIE"" gives good coverage of new letters while keeping E in a different position.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (position unknown) and N (position unknown)

So the secret word is a 5-letter combination of E and N with three other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Remaining common letters that haven’t appeared: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, H, etc.

We need to place E and N in new positions and test fresh consonants.  
A good word that satisfies these constraints and tests three new letters is “NEEDY”:

- Contains both E and N.
- Places E in the 2nd position (never tried there before) and N in the 1st position (never tried there either).
- Tests D and Y, which are common and haven’t been used yet.

Other possibilities like “LENSE” or “PEACE” would reuse disallowed letters, so “NEEDY” is the best choice among simple, legal combinations.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- N (from UNTIE and NEEDY: N was in positions 1 and 1, both marked “-”)

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ Y  
and we know N must appear somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 3, or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains N exactly once.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D).

Remaining common letters not yet tried: L, C, M, P, B, G, K, F, W, V, H, etc.

We want to test a new consonant in one of the open positions (1, 3, 4) and place N in one of those spots.  
A simple word that fits is “BENCH”:
- E is in position 2 ✓
- Y is NOT in position 5, so “BENCH” is invalid because we need Y in position 5.

Another candidate: “VENNY” – but it repeats N and Y is in position 4, not 5.

Next candidate: “HENGY” – but G hasn’t been tested and H hasn’t been tested, but this seems obscure.

Let’s list valid words matching the pattern _ E _ _ Y with N somewhere and no forbidden letters:

Possible positions for N:
- Position 1: N E _ _ Y → “NEWLY” (but W and L haven’t been used, but L is okay)
- Position 3: _ E N _ Y → “CENSY” – not a real word
- Position 4: _ E _ N Y → “BENNY” – but B and N are okay, but it repeats N

“NEWLY” is a valid word:
- N in position 1 (new position)
- E in position 2 ✓
- W in position 3 (new letter)
- L in position 4 (new letter)
- Y in position 5 ✓

It uses only allowed letters and places N in a new spot (position 1).

Therefore, “NEWLY” is a good next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters that are all common. Some good options include: STARE, AROSE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<|im_end|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Excludes A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A strong next guess is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in the 4th position (different from 5th position in AROSE).
- Includes U and N (new letters).
- Excludes A, R, O, S.
- Tests T and I as additional letters.

Other options could be ""ELITE"", ""UNITY"", ""FIELD"", ""MELEE"", etc., but ""UNTIE"" gives good coverage of new letters while keeping E in a different position.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (position unknown) and N (position unknown)

So the secret word is a 5-letter combination of E and N with three other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Remaining common letters that haven’t appeared: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, H, etc.

We need to place E and N in new positions and test fresh consonants.  
A good word that satisfies these constraints and tests three new letters is “NEEDY”:

- Contains both E and N.
- Places E in the 2nd position (never tried there before) and N in the 1st position (never tried there either).
- Tests D and Y, which are common and haven’t been used yet.

Other possibilities like “LENSE” or “PEACE” would reuse disallowed letters, so “NEEDY” is the best choice among simple, legal combinations.

- Uses E in the 4th position (different from 5th position in AROSE).
- Includes U and N (new letters).
- Excludes A, R, O, S.
- Tests T and I as additional letters.

Other options could be ""ELITE"", ""UNITY"", ""FIELD"", ""MELEE"", etc., but ""UNTIE"" gives good coverage of new letters while keeping E in a different position.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (position unknown) and N (position unknown)

So the secret word is a 5-letter combination of E and N with three other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Remaining common letters that haven’t appeared: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, H, etc.

We need to place E and N in new positions and test fresh consonants.  
A good word that satisfies these constraints and tests three new letters is “NEEDY”:

- Contains both E and N.
- Places E in the 2nd position (never tried there before) and N in the 1st position (never tried there either).
- Tests D and Y, which are common and haven’t been used yet.

Other possibilities like “LENSE” or “PEACE” would reuse disallowed letters, so “NEEDY” is the best choice among simple, legal combinations.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- N (from UNTIE and NEEDY: N was in positions 1 and 1, both marked “-”)

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ Y  
and we know N must appear somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 3, or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains N exactly once.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D).

Remaining common letters not yet tried: L, C, M, P, B, G, K, F, W, V, H, etc.

We want to test a new consonant in one of the open positions (1, 3, 4) and place N in one of those spots.  
A simple word that fits is “BENCH”:
- E is in position 2 ✓
- Y is NOT in position 5, so “BENCH” is invalid because we need Y in position 5.

Another candidate: “VENNY” – but it repeats N and Y is in position 4, not 5.

Next candidate: “HENGY” – but G hasn’t been tested and H hasn’t been tested, but this seems obscure.

Let’s list valid words matching the pattern _ E _ _ Y with N somewhere and no forbidden letters:

Possible positions for N:
- Position 1: N E _ _ Y → “NEWLY” (but W and L haven’t been used, but L is okay)
- Position 3: _ E N _ Y → “CENSY” – not a real word
- Position 4: _ E _ N Y → “BENNY” – but B and N are okay, but it repeats N

“NEWLY” is a valid word:
- N in position 1 (new position)
- E in position 2 ✓
- W in position 3 (new letter)
- L in position 4 (new letter)
- Y in position 5 ✓

It uses only allowed letters and places N in a new spot (position 1).

Therefore, “NEWLY” is a good next guess.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D, W, L  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- N (from UNTIE and NEEDY and NEWLY: N was in positions 1,1,1 and always marked “-”)

So the pattern is fixed at: _ E _ _ Y  
and N must appear exactly once in positions 3 or 4 (since position 1 gives “-”).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains N exactly once, in position 3 or 4.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D, W, L).

Remaining common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, B, etc.

Testing position 3 for N: _ E N _ Y  
Possible word: “FENNY” – but F, N, M are allowed and it’s a valid word.

Testing position 4 for N: _ E _ N Y  
Possible word: “CENSY” – not valid; “VENNY” – not valid; “BENNY” – B and N are allowed, but “BENNY” is valid.

Between “FENNY” and “BENNY”, both fit, but “FENNY” uses F which hasn’t been tested yet, giving more information.

So choose “FENNY”.

From the latest feedback (FENNY → F(x) E(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓)) we now have:

- Fixed positions:  
  2 = E, 5 = Y, 3 = N

- The first letter must be a new letter that has never been tried.  
  Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D, W, L, F  
  Remaining common consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V

- The fourth position is already filled by the second N (position 3), so the word pattern is:  
  ? E N ? Y

Looking at valid English 5-letter words matching “?EN?Y”:

- B: BENNY  (valid)

- H: HENNY  (valid)  
- K: KENNY  (valid)  
- M: MENNY  (invalid)  
- P: PENNY  (valid)  
- V: VENNY  (invalid)

The most common and likely word among these is “PENNY”.

Let’s verify:  
P (new, untested), E (position 2 ✓), N (position 3 ✓), N (position 4 ✓), Y (position 5 ✓).  
No conflicts with prior feedback.

Therefore, the correct word must be PENNY.
