### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A but not in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new word that:
- Has A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are ruled out).

A word like ""ADMIT"" could work:
- A is in position 2 (not first, so it satisfies A(-)).
- Uses common letters D, M, I, T which weren't tested yet.

Possible patterns: _ _ A _ _ with D in 1, 2, or 5.

Candidate words:

- BADGE → G and E; E is ruled out.  
- BADLY already ruled out.  
- BADGE ruled out.  
- BADLY ruled out.  
- VADUM → U is allowed, D in 3? No, A is fixed in 3.  
- HADJO → O, J issues.  
- BAGEL → E ruled out.  
- HALVD → D in 5 (allowed), uses H, A, L, V, D. All letters allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A but not in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new word that:
- Has A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are ruled out).

A word like ""ADMIT"" could work:
- A is in position 2 (not first, so it satisfies A(-)).
- Uses common letters D, M, I, T which weren't tested yet.

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, M, I, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 or 2.
   - D is in the word but not in position 2.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, B, G, H, K, P, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already confirmed and E, O, I are ruled out).

We need a word that:
- Contains A and D.
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 2.
- Places D somewhere other than position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “CANDY”:
- C, N, Y have not been tested.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- D is in position 4 (allowed).
- All letters are from the remaining pool.

Let’s try CANDY.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, M, I, T, C, N, Y, H, L, V  
Letters confirmed IN the word: A, D  
Known positions:  
- A is in position 3 (✓).  
- D is in position 5 (✓).  

So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ D  

Remaining untested common letters: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones).

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one consonant for position 4, all from the unused pool.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, F, G, K, P, W  
- Position 2: B, F, G, K, P, W  
- Position 4: B, F, G, K, P, W  

Looking for real words:
- B _ A _ D → BAGAD (not a word), BADAD (not a word)  
- F _ A _ D → FAGAD (no), FADAD (no)  
- G _ A _ D → G A _ A D → G A M A D (M ruled out), G A P A D (not a word)  
- K _ A _ D → K A _ A D → K A P A D (not a word)  
- P _ A _ D → P A _ A D → P A P A D (not a word)  
- W _ A _ D → W A _ A D → W A S A D (S ruled out)  

Wait, let’s list all valid English words matching _ _ A _ D with allowed letters:
