### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful feedback about which letters are in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution according to standard English analysis.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains A and T, but A is not in position 3 and T is not in position 4.
3. It does not contain L or E.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5

I need a word that starts with S, includes A and T, excludes L and E, and respects the positional constraints.

Let me think of words:
- SATIN: S ✓, A in 2 ✓, T in 3 ✓, but T can't be in 4 (no conflict here), but we don't know about N yet. However, this uses I which might be useful.
- STAIN: S ✓, T in 2 ✓, A in 3 but A can't be in 3 (from feedback), so invalid.
- STAMP: S ✓, T in 2 ✓, A in 3 but again A can't be in 3, invalid.
- SATCH: S ✓, A in 2 ✓, T in 3 ✓, but T can't be in 4 (no conflict), and C/H are new letters.
- SATYR: S ✓, A in 2 ✓, T in 3 ✓, but Y/R are new and might be useful.
- STAND: S ✓, T in 2 ✓, A in 3 (invalid), N/D new.
- STASH: S ✓, T in 2 ✓, A in 3 (invalid), S/H new.
- STAMP: same issue with A in 3.

Looking at these, SATIN seems valid:
- S ✓
- A in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (allowed, since T just can't be in 4)
- I and N are new letters to test.

Another option is SATCH (but C and H are less common).
SATYR is also possible but Y is less common.

I'll go with SATIN as it tests new letters (I, N) and keeps the constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. T is fixed in position 3.
3. A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (so A must be in 4 or 5).
4. I is in the word but not in position 4 (so I must be in 2 or 5).
5. Letters L, E, N are not in the word at all.

So far the pattern is:  
S _ T _ _

With A and I still to place, and no repeats of letters already ruled out.

Possible placements:
- A can be 4 or 5
- I can be 2 or 5

Let’s list the remaining positions and see what fits:

Case 1: A in 4, I in 2  
Word shape: S I T A _  
The last letter must be a new consonant not yet tested (no L, E, N, S, T, A, I).  
Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A common ending consonant that makes a valid word is “C”, forming “SITAC” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next try “R” → “SITAR” – valid word.

Case 2: A in 5, I in 2  
Word shape: S I T _ A  
The missing 4th letter must be a new consonant.  
Trying common consonants: “SITBA” – invalid, “SITCA” – invalid, “SITDA” – invalid…  
“SITRA” – not a word.  
“SITGA” – not a word.  
“SITHA” – not a word.  
“SITMA” – not a word.  
“SITPA” – not a word.  
“SITKA” – not a word.  
“SITZA” – not a word.  
None seem valid.

Case 3: A in 4, I in 5  
Word shape: S _ T A I  
The 2nd letter must be a new consonant not yet used.  
Common consonants:  
- B → “SBTAI” – invalid  
- C → “SCTAI” – invalid  
- D → “SDTAI” – invalid  
- F → “SFTAI” – invalid  
- G → “SGTAI” – invalid  
- H → “SHTAI” – invalid  
- K → “SKTAI” – invalid  
- M → “SMTAI” – invalid  
- P → “SPTAI” – invalid  
- R → “SRTAI” – invalid  
- V → “SVTAI” – invalid  
- W → “SWTAI” – invalid  
None of these are valid English words.

Thus the only viable candidate from the above is **SITAR** (Case 1), which fits all constraints:
- S ✓ position 1  
- I in position 2 (allowed)  
- T ✓ position 3  
- A in position 4 (allowed)  
- R is a new letter to test.
