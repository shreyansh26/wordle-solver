For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- 4th letter is S.
- The word contains O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in the 4th position.
- O somewhere except 3rd.
- No A, R, E.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses O in a different position and common consonants. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common consonants.
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd), satisfying the feedback.
- S is not in POINT, but we already know S is in 4th position, so we need a word that has S in 4th. “POINT” doesn’t have S, so this is invalid.

Next idea: “DOUBT” – but S is not in 4th position.

We need S in 4th. Let’s try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, P, S are consonants.
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd).
- But “CLOPS” is a bit obscure.

Another option: “HUMPS” – but no O.

“BLOWS”:
- B, L, O, W, S.
- O is in 3rd position – but feedback says O is not in 3rd. So invalid.

“GLOWS”:
- G, L, O, W, S.
- O is in 3rd position – invalid.

“MOULD” – no S in 4th.

“WORLD” – O in 2nd, S not present.

“TROOP” – has R (invalid), and O in 3rd (invalid).

“FOIST”:
- F, O, I, S, T.
- O is in 2nd position (valid), S is in 4th (valid).
- No A, R, E.
- All letters are unique, which is good for elimination.

- GLOSS → repeats S (allowed, but we don’t know if letters can repeat)
- HONUS → H, U, N allowed
- JOLLS → L repeats, but J, L allowed
- KOSMS → S repeats, but K, M allowed
- LOSER → E is out
- MOSHS → H repeats, but M, H allowed
- POSIT → I, T out

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in the 4th position.
- O somewhere except 3rd.
- No A, R, E.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses O in a different position and common consonants. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common consonants.
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd), satisfying the feedback.
- S is not in POINT, but we already know S is in 4th position, so we need a word that has S in 4th. “POINT” doesn’t have S, so this is invalid.

Next idea: “DOUBT” – but S is not in 4th position.

We need S in 4th. Let’s try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, P, S are consonants.
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd).
- But “CLOPS” is a bit obscure.

Another option: “HUMPS” – but no O.

“BLOWS”:
- B, L, O, W, S.
- O is in 3rd position – but feedback says O is not in 3rd. So invalid.

“GLOWS”:
- G, L, O, W, S.
- O is in 3rd position – invalid.

“MOULD” – no S in 4th.

“WORLD” – O in 2nd, S not present.

“TROOP” – has R (invalid), and O in 3rd (invalid).

“FOIST”:
- F, O, I, S, T.
- O is in 2nd position (valid), S is in 4th (valid).
- No A, R, E.
- All letters are unique, which is good for elimination.

This seems like a solid second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has S in the 4th position (from AROSE).
2. The word has O in the 2nd position (from FOIST).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, F, I, T.

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ S _

Remaining consonants that could appear: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels that could appear: U (since O is already placed, and A, E, I are out).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 2 and S in position 4
- uses only letters not yet ruled out
- uses no A, R, E, F, I, T

Let’s list some possibilities that fit _ O _ S _ and use allowed letters:

- BONUS  → uses N, U (both allowed)
- GLOSS → repeats S (allowed, but we don’t know if letters can repeat)
- HONUS → H, U, N allowed
- JOLLS → L repeats, but J, L allowed
- KOSMS → S repeats, but K, M allowed
- LOSER → E is out
- MOSHS → H repeats, but M, H allowed
- POSIT → I, T out
- VODKS → K, but S is in 4th, so _ O _ S _ → VODKS doesn’t fit

The most straightforward valid word without repeating letters or using banned letters is BONUS.

Let’s check:
- B, O, N, U, S
- O is in 2nd, S in 4th ✔
- No banned letters ✔

Therefore, BONUS is a good next guess.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. From AROSE:  
   A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word and is in the 4th position.  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.

2. From FOIST:  
   F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)  
   ⇒ O is now confirmed to be in the 2nd position.  
   ⇒ S is confirmed to be in the 4th position.  
   ⇒ Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, F, I, T.

3. From BONUS:  
   B(x) O(✓) N(x) U(x) S(-)  
   ⇒ O is still in the 2nd position (consistent).  
   ⇒ S is marked “-” (in the word but wrong position) – but this contradicts the earlier ✓ from FOIST, which placed S correctly in the 4th position.  
   Therefore the “-” must simply confirm S is indeed in the word (no new positional info).  
   ⇒ B, N, U are not in the word.

So far we have:

- Pattern: _ O _ S _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, B, E, F, I, N, R, T, U
- Letters still allowed: C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels left: none except O (already placed), so all other vowels are out (A, E, I, U).  
  Therefore the only remaining vowel is O in position 2.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ O _ S _ using only the allowed consonants.

Possible candidates:
- CLOSS (but S repeats, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed)
- GLOSS (same issue)
- HOSKY (Y sometimes acts as vowel, but K and Y are consonants)
- JOLLY (but L repeats and Y is questionable)
- LOSER (E is out)
- MOSHS (H repeats)
- POSSE (E is out)
- VODKA (A, K, O, V, D – but A is out)
- WOKER (E, R out)
- YOKES (E out)

The cleanest word without repeats or banned letters is:

HOSKY

Check:
- H, O, S, K, Y
- O is 2nd, S is 4th ✔
- No banned letters ✔
- Common word ✔

Therefore, HOSKY is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

These are all very common letters in English words. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.\n- O(-) – O is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.\n- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the 4th position.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo far we know:\n- 4th letter is S.\n- The word contains O, but O is not in the 3rd position.\n- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with:\n- S in the 4th position.\n- O somewhere except 3rd.\n- No A, R, E.\n\nPossible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nPossible vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are out).\n\nLet’s try a word that uses O in a different position and common consonants.

   ⇒ O is in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in position 4.  
   ⇒ Y is in the word but not position 5.  
   ⇒ New exclusions: H, K.

Current known pattern: _ O _ S _  
Letters still allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, B, E, F, H, I, K, N, R, T, U  

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ using only allowed letters and including Y somewhere except position 5.

Possible words:
- JOYS – too short.
- LOYAL – A is out.
- MOSSY – S repeats, but we don’t know if repeats are allowed.
- JOCKY – C, J, K, O, X, Y – but K is out.
- VOGSY – G, S, Y – but V, O, G, S, Y: O is 2nd, S 4th, Y must be 1st or 3rd. VOGSY has Y in 5th, but feedback says Y is not in 5th. So invalid.
- JOLLY – L repeats, but Y is 5th (invalid per feedback).
- JOYS – too short.

The only valid candidate fitting all constraints is:

MOSSY

Check:
- M, O, S, S, Y  
- Pattern: _ O _ S _ → M O S Y (but needs 5 letters).  
Wait, MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which is 5 letters: positions 1-5.  
But we need O in 2nd and S in 4th: _ O _ S _ → so the word must be C O _ S _ or D O _ S _, etc.

Looking again: we need O in 2nd and S in 4th, with Y somewhere not 5th.

Valid words:
- COYS – too short.
- DOYS – too short.
- GOYS – too short.
- JOYS – too short.
- LOYS – too short.
- MOYS – too short.
- POYS – too short.
- VOYS – too short.
- WOYS – too short.

None of these fit. Let’s re-examine allowed letters and pattern.

We have _ O _ S _ and Y must be in 1st or 3rd position.

Possible words:
- Y O _ S _ – but Y is 1st, O 2nd, S 4th. Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
  - Y O C S _ – 5th letter must be from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. None form a word.
  - Y O D S _ – same issue.
  - Y O G S _ – no word.
  - Y O L S _ – no word.
  - Y O M S _ – no word.
  - Y O P S _ – no word.
  - Y O V S _ – no word.
  - Y O W S _ – no word.

Next possibility: _ O Y S _ – but then S is 4th and Y is 3rd, which fits _ O Y S _.
We need a word of the form _ O Y S _ with letters from allowed set.

Allowed consonants: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- C O Y S _ – no 5-letter word.
- D O Y S _ – no word.
- G O Y S _ – no word.
- J O Y S _ – no word.
- L O Y S _ – no word.
- M O Y S _ – no word.
- P O Y S _ – no word.
- V O Y S _ – no word.
- W O Y S _ – no word.

This suggests MOSSY might be the intended word despite the double S, as it’s the only 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ with allowed letters and including Y not at 5th.

But MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which has S in 3rd and 4th – but we know S must be 4th. So MOSSY has S in 4th, but Y is 5th – which contradicts feedback that Y is not in 5th.

Rechecking feedback: Guess 4: HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  
This means Y is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore Y must be in 1st or 3rd.

We need a word _ O _ S _ with Y in 1st or 3rd.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- Y O _ S _ – no valid word.
- _ O Y S _ – need 1st letter from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible:
- C O Y S _ – no word.
- D O Y S _ – no word.
- G O Y S _ – no word.
- J O Y S _ – no word.
- L O Y S _ – no word.
- M O Y S _ – no word.
- P O Y S _ – no word.
- V O Y S _ – no word.
- W O Y S _ – no word.

This seems impossible. Re-examining allowed letters and pattern.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ S _ (positions 1-5). We need Y in 1st or 3rd.

Let me list possible 5-letter words fitting _ O _ S _ with Y in 1st or 3rd and using allowed letters.

- Y O C S _ – no word.
- Y O D S _ – no word.
- Y O G S _ – no word.
- Y O L S _ – no word.
- Y O M S _ – no word.
- Y O P S _ – no word.
- Y O V S _ – no word.
- Y O W S _ – no word.

- C O Y S _ – no word.
- D O Y S _ – no word.
- G O Y S _ – no word.
- J O Y S _ – no word.
- L O Y S _ – no word.
- M O Y S _ – no word.
- P O Y S _ – no word.
- V O Y S _ – no word.
- W O Y S _ – no word.

This indicates we might have missed a word or need to reconsider. However, ""MOSSY"" was the only 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ with Y not at 5th, but it has Y at 5th which contradicts. Therefore, no valid word fits under current constraints, implying an error in earlier steps.

But rechecking: the pattern is _ O _ S _ (positions 1-5). We need Y in 1st or 3rd.

The only possible word is ""LOYAL"" but A is out. ""MOSSY"" has Y at 5th which is invalid. ""VOGUE"" has E out. 

Realizing the issue: under current exclusions, no valid 5-letter word fits _ O _ S _ with Y not at 5th. This suggests ""MOSSY"" might be acceptable despite Y at 5th, but feedback explicitly says Y is not at 5th. 

Re-evaluating, the correct word must be ""VOGUE"" but E is out. ""JOLLY"" has Y at 5th. 

This indicates the only possible word is ""MOSSY"" but it contradicts feedback. Therefore, the intended word must be ""MOSSY"" and the feedback interpretation might allow Y at 5th despite the ""✓"" for Y, suggesting Y is in word but position not specified – but original feedback says Y(✓) meaning Y is correct in position 5, which contradicts ""-"".

Re-reading feedback: Guess 4: HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  
This means:
- O is correct in 2nd.
- S is in word but not 4th (but this contradicts earlier ✓ from FOIST).
This suggests a misinterpretation: the ""-"" for S in HOSKY means S is in word but not in 3rd position (since S was 3rd in HOSKY), not that it's not 4th. 

Correct interpretation:
- S(-) in HOSKY means S is in word but not in 3rd position (it was 3rd in HOSKY), so S could still be 4th.
- Y(✓) means Y is correct in 5th position.

Therefore:
- Pattern: _ O _ S Y
- Letters still allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
- C O _ S Y – 3rd letter must be from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
  - C O C S Y – no word.
  - C O D S Y – no word.
  - C O G S Y – no word.
  - C O L S Y – no word.
  - C O M S Y – no word.
  - C O P S Y – no word.
  - C O V S Y – no word.
  - C O W S Y – no word.

- D O _ S Y – same issue.
- G O _ S Y – no word.
- J O _ S Y – no word.
- L O _ S Y – no word.
- M O _ S Y – no word.
- P O _ S Y – no word.
- V O _ S Y – no word.
- W O _ S Y – no word.

This again seems impossible. Realizing the only valid word fitting _ O _ S Y is ""MOSSY"" but it has Y at 5th and S at 4th, which matches _ O _ S Y.

But MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which has S in 3rd and 4th. The pattern _ O _ S Y requires S in 4th, so MOSSY has S in 4th and Y in 5th, which matches. 

Therefore, MOSSY is the correct word.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- 4th letter is S.
- The word contains O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in the 4th position.
- O somewhere except 3rd.
- No A, R, E.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses O in a different position and common consonants. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common consonants.
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd), satisfying the feedback.
- S is not in POINT, but we already know S is in 4th position, so we need a word that has S in 4th. “POINT” doesn’t have S, so this is invalid.

Next idea: “DOUBT” – but S is not in 4th position.

We need S in 4th. Let’s try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, P, S are consonants.
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd).
- But “CLOPS” is a bit obscure.

Another option: “HUMPS” – but no O.

“BLOWS”:
- B, L, O, W, S.
- O is in 3rd position – but feedback says O is not in 3rd. So invalid.

“GLOWS”:
- G, L, O, W, S.
- O is in 3rd position – invalid.

“MOULD” – no S in 4th.

“WORLD” – O in 2nd, S not present.

“TROOP” – has R (invalid), and O in 3rd (invalid).

“FOIST”:
- F, O, I, S, T.
- O is in 2nd position (valid), S is in 4th (valid).
- No A, R, E.
- All letters are unique, which is good for elimination.

This seems like a solid second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FOIST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has S in the 4th position (from AROSE).
2. The word has O in the 2nd position (from FOIST).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, F, I, T.

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ S _

Remaining consonants that could appear: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels that could appear: U (since O is already placed, and A, E, I are out).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 2 and S in position 4
- uses only letters not yet ruled out
- uses no A, R, E, F, I, T

Let’s list some possibilities that fit _ O _ S _ and use allowed letters:

- BONUS  → uses N, U (both allowed)
- GLOSS → repeats S (allowed, but we don’t know if letters can repeat)
- HONUS → H, U, N allowed
- JOLLS → L repeats, but J, L allowed
- KOSMS → S repeats, but K, M allowed
- LOSER → E is out
- MOSHS → H repeats, but M, H allowed
- POSIT → I, T out
- VODKS → K, but S is in 4th, so _ O _ S _ → VODKS doesn’t fit

The most straightforward valid word without repeating letters or using banned letters is BONUS.

Let’s check:
- B, O, N, U, S
- O is in 2nd, S in 4th ✔
- No banned letters ✔
- Common word ✔

Therefore, BONUS is a good next guess.

Guess 3: BONUS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(x) U(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. From AROSE:  
   A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word and is in the 4th position.  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.

2. From FOIST:  
   F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)  
   ⇒ O is now confirmed to be in the 2nd position.  
   ⇒ S is confirmed to be in the 4th position.  
   ⇒ Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, F, I, T.

3. From BONUS:  
   B(x) O(✓) N(x) U(x) S(-)  
   ⇒ O is still in the 2nd position (consistent).  
   ⇒ S is marked “-” (in the word but wrong position) – but this contradicts the earlier ✓ from FOIST, which placed S correctly in the 4th position.  
   Therefore the “-” must simply confirm S is indeed in the word (no new positional info).  
   ⇒ B, N, U are not in the word.

So far we have:

- Pattern: _ O _ S _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, B, E, F, I, N, R, T, U
- Letters still allowed: C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels left: none except O (already placed), so all other vowels are out (A, E, I, U).  
  Therefore the only remaining vowel is O in position 2.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ O _ S _ using only the allowed consonants.

Possible candidates:
- CLOSS (but S repeats, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed)
- GLOSS (same issue)
- HOSKY (Y sometimes acts as vowel, but K and Y are consonants)
- JOLLY (but L repeats and Y is questionable)
- LOSER (E is out)
- MOSHS (H repeats)
- POSSE (E is out)
- VODKA (A, K, O, V, D – but A is out)
- WOKER (E, R out)
- YOKES (E out)

The cleanest word without repeats or banned letters is:

HOSKY

Check:
- H, O, S, K, Y
- O is 2nd, S is 4th ✔
- No banned letters ✔
- Common word ✔

Therefore, HOSKY is a good next guess.

Guess 4: HOSKY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the four guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in position 4.  
   ⇒ O is in the word but not position 3.

2. FOIST → F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in position 4.  
   ⇒ New exclusions: F, I, T.

3. BONUS → B(x) O(✓) N(x) U(x) S(-)  
   ⇒ O is in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in position 4.  
   ⇒ New exclusions: B, N, U.

4. HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ O is in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in position 4.  
   ⇒ Y is in the word but not position 5.  
   ⇒ New exclusions: H, K.

Current known pattern: _ O _ S _  
Letters still allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, B, E, F, H, I, K, N, R, T, U  

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ using only allowed letters and including Y somewhere except position 5.

Possible words:
- JOYS – too short.
- LOYAL – A is out.
- MOSSY – S repeats, but we don’t know if repeats are allowed.
- JOCKY – C, J, K, O, X, Y – but K is out.
- VOGSY – G, S, Y – but V, O, G, S, Y: O is 2nd, S 4th, Y must be 1st or 3rd. VOGSY has Y in 5th, but feedback says Y is not in 5th. So invalid.
- JOLLY – L repeats, but Y is 5th (invalid per feedback).
- JOYS – too short.

The only valid candidate fitting all constraints is:

MOSSY

Check:
- M, O, S, S, Y  
- Pattern: _ O _ S _ → M O S Y (but needs 5 letters).  
Wait, MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which is 5 letters: positions 1-5.  
But we need O in 2nd and S in 4th: _ O _ S _ → so the word must be C O _ S _ or D O _ S _, etc.

Looking again: we need O in 2nd and S in 4th, with Y somewhere not 5th.

Valid words:
- COYS – too short.
- DOYS – too short.
- GOYS – too short.
- JOYS – too short.
- LOYS – too short.
- MOYS – too short.
- POYS – too short.
- VOYS – too short.
- WOYS – too short.

None of these fit. Let’s re-examine allowed letters and pattern.

We have _ O _ S _ and Y must be in 1st or 3rd position.

Possible words:
- Y O _ S _ – but Y is 1st, O 2nd, S 4th. Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
  - Y O C S _ – 5th letter must be from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. None form a word.
  - Y O D S _ – same issue.
  - Y O G S _ – no word.
  - Y O L S _ – no word.
  - Y O M S _ – no word.
  - Y O P S _ – no word.
  - Y O V S _ – no word.
  - Y O W S _ – no word.

Next possibility: _ O Y S _ – but then S is 4th and Y is 3rd, which fits _ O Y S _.
We need a word of the form _ O Y S _ with letters from allowed set.

Allowed consonants: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- C O Y S _ – no 5-letter word.
- D O Y S _ – no word.
- G O Y S _ – no word.
- J O Y S _ – no word.
- L O Y S _ – no word.
- M O Y S _ – no word.
- P O Y S _ – no word.
- V O Y S _ – no word.
- W O Y S _ – no word.

This suggests MOSSY might be the intended word despite the double S, as it’s the only 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ with allowed letters and including Y not at 5th.

But MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which has S in 3rd and 4th – but we know S must be 4th. So MOSSY has S in 4th, but Y is 5th – which contradicts feedback that Y is not in 5th.

Rechecking feedback: Guess 4: HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  
This means Y is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore Y must be in 1st or 3rd.

We need a word _ O _ S _ with Y in 1st or 3rd.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- Y O _ S _ – no valid word.
- _ O Y S _ – need 1st letter from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible:
- C O Y S _ – no word.
- D O Y S _ – no word.
- G O Y S _ – no word.
- J O Y S _ – no word.
- L O Y S _ – no word.
- M O Y S _ – no word.
- P O Y S _ – no word.
- V O Y S _ – no word.
- W O Y S _ – no word.

This seems impossible. Re-examining allowed letters and pattern.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ S _ (positions 1-5). We need Y in 1st or 3rd.

Let me list possible 5-letter words fitting _ O _ S _ with Y in 1st or 3rd and using allowed letters.

- Y O C S _ – no word.
- Y O D S _ – no word.
- Y O G S _ – no word.
- Y O L S _ – no word.
- Y O M S _ – no word.
- Y O P S _ – no word.
- Y O V S _ – no word.
- Y O W S _ – no word.

- C O Y S _ – no word.
- D O Y S _ – no word.
- G O Y S _ – no word.
- J O Y S _ – no word.
- L O Y S _ – no word.
- M O Y S _ – no word.
- P O Y S _ – no word.
- V O Y S _ – no word.
- W O Y S _ – no word.

This indicates we might have missed a word or need to reconsider. However, ""MOSSY"" was the only 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ with Y not at 5th, but it has Y at 5th which contradicts. Therefore, no valid word fits under current constraints, implying an error in earlier steps.

But rechecking: the pattern is _ O _ S _ (positions 1-5). We need Y in 1st or 3rd.

The only possible word is ""LOYAL"" but A is out. ""MOSSY"" has Y at 5th which is invalid. ""VOGUE"" has E out. 

Realizing the issue: under current exclusions, no valid 5-letter word fits _ O _ S _ with Y not at 5th. This suggests ""MOSSY"" might be acceptable despite Y at 5th, but feedback explicitly says Y is not at 5th. 

Re-evaluating, the correct word must be ""VOGUE"" but E is out. ""JOLLY"" has Y at 5th. 

This indicates the only possible word is ""MOSSY"" but it contradicts feedback. Therefore, the intended word must be ""MOSSY"" and the feedback interpretation might allow Y at 5th despite the ""✓"" for Y, suggesting Y is in word but position not specified – but original feedback says Y(✓) meaning Y is correct in position 5, which contradicts ""-"".

Re-reading feedback: Guess 4: HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  
This means:
- O is correct in 2nd.
- S is in word but not 4th (but this contradicts earlier ✓ from FOIST).
This suggests a misinterpretation: the ""-"" for S in HOSKY means S is in word but not in 3rd position (since S was 3rd in HOSKY), not that it's not 4th. 

Correct interpretation:
- S(-) in HOSKY means S is in word but not in 3rd position (it was 3rd in HOSKY), so S could still be 4th.
- Y(✓) means Y is correct in 5th position.

Therefore:
- Pattern: _ O _ S Y
- Letters still allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
- C O _ S Y – 3rd letter must be from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
  - C O C S Y – no word.
  - C O D S Y – no word.
  - C O G S Y – no word.
  - C O L S Y – no word.
  - C O M S Y – no word.
  - C O P S Y – no word.
  - C O V S Y – no word.
  - C O W S Y – no word.

- D O _ S Y – same issue.
- G O _ S Y – no word.
- J O _ S Y – no word.
- L O _ S Y – no word.
- M O _ S Y – no word.
- P O _ S Y – no word.
- V O _ S Y – no word.
- W O _ S Y – no word.

This again seems impossible. Realizing the only valid word fitting _ O _ S Y is ""MOSSY"" but it has Y at 5th and S at 4th, which matches _ O _ S Y.

But MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which has S in 3rd and 4th. The pattern _ O _ S Y requires S in 4th, so MOSSY has S in 4th and Y in 5th, which matches. 

Therefore, MOSSY is the correct word.

Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.\n  - Y O C S _ – 5th letter must be from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

So MOSSY has S in 4th, but Y is 5th – which contradicts feedback that Y is not in 5th.\n\nRechecking feedback: Guess 4: HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  \nThis means Y is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore Y must be in 1st or 3rd.\n\nWe need a word _ O _ S _ with Y in 1st or 3rd.\n\nLooking for 5-letter words:\n- Y O _ S _ – no valid word.\n- _ O Y S _ – need 1st letter from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nPossible:\n- C O Y S _ – no word.\n- D O Y S _ – no word.\n- G O Y S _ – no word.\n- J O Y S _ – no word.\n- L O Y S _ – no word.\n- M O Y S _ – no word.\n- P O Y S _ – no word.\n- V O Y S _ – no word.\n- W O Y S _ – no word.\n\nThis seems impossible. Re-examining allowed letters and pattern.\n\nWait, the pattern is _ O _ S _ (positions 1-5). We need Y in 1st or 3rd.\n\nLet me list possible 5-letter words fitting _ O _ S _ with Y in 1st or 3rd and using allowed letters.\n\n- Y O C S _ – no word.\n- Y O D S _ – no word.\n- Y O G S _ – no word.\n- Y O L S _ – no word.\n- Y O M S _ – no word.\n- Y O P S _ – no word.\n- Y O V S _ – no word.\n- Y O W S _ – no word.\n\n- C O Y S _ – no word.\n- D O Y S _ – no word.\n- G O Y S _ – no word.\n- J O Y S _ – no word.\n- L O Y S _ – no word.\n- M O Y S _ – no word.\n- P O Y S _ – no word.\n- V O Y S _ – no word.\n- W O Y S _ – no word.\n\nThis indicates we might have missed a word or need to reconsider. However, ""MOSSY"" was the only 5-letter word fitting _ O _ S _ with Y not at 5th, but it has Y at 5th which contradicts. Therefore, no valid word fits under current constraints, implying an error in earlier steps.\n\nBut rechecking: the pattern is _ O _ S _ (positions 1-5). We need Y in 1st or 3rd.\n\nThe only possible word is ""LOYAL"" but A is out. ""MOSSY"" has Y at 5th which is invalid. ""VOGUE"" has E out. \n\nRealizing the issue: under current exclusions, no valid 5-letter word fits _ O _ S _ with Y not at 5th. This suggests ""MOSSY"" might be acceptable despite Y at 5th, but feedback explicitly says Y is not at 5th. \n\nRe-evaluating, the correct word must be ""VOGUE"" but E is out. ""JOLLY"" has Y at 5th. \n\nThis indicates the only possible word is ""MOSSY"" but it contradicts feedback. Therefore, the intended word must be ""MOSSY"" and the feedback interpretation might allow Y at 5th despite the ""✓"" for Y, suggesting Y is in word but position not specified – but original feedback says Y(✓) meaning Y is correct in position 5, which contradicts ""-"".\n\nRe-reading feedback: Guess 4: HOSKY → H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)  \nThis means:\n- O is correct in 2nd.\n- S is in word but not 4th (but this contradicts earlier ✓ from FOIST).\nThis suggests a misinterpretation: the ""-"" for S in HOSKY means S is in word but not in 3rd position (since S was 3rd in HOSKY), not that it\'s not 4th. \n\nCorrect interpretation:\n- S(-) in HOSKY means S is in word but not in 3rd position (it was 3rd in HOSKY), so S could still be 4th.\n- Y(✓) means Y is correct in 5th position.\n\nTherefore:\n- Pattern: _ O _ S Y\n- Letters still allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z\n- Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed set.\n\nPossible words:\n- C O _ S Y – 3rd letter must be from allowed: C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n  - C O C S Y – no word.\n  - C O D S Y – no word.\n  - C O G S Y – no word.\n  - C O L S Y – no word.\n  - C O M S Y – no word.\n  - C O P S Y – no word.\n  - C O V S Y – no word.\n  - C O W S Y – no word.\n\n- D O _ S Y – same issue.\n- G O _ S Y – no word.\n- J O _ S Y – no word.\n- L O _ S Y – no word.\n- M O _ S Y – no word.\n- P O _ S Y – no word.\n- V O _ S Y – no word.\n- W O _ S Y – no word.\n\nThis again seems impossible. Realizing the only valid word fitting _ O _ S Y is ""MOSSY"" but it has Y at 5th and S at 4th, which matches _ O _ S Y.\n\nBut MOSSY is M-O-S-S-Y, which has S in 3rd and 4th. The pattern _ O _ S Y requires S in 4th, so MOSSY has S in 4th and Y in 5th, which matches. \n\nTherefore, MOSSY is the correct word.\n\n<guess>MOSSY</guess>\n\n<guess>MOSSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: FOIST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: BONUS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(x) U(x) S(-)\nGuess 4: HOSKY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: MOSSY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
