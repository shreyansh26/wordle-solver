For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Common remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

Let’s try a word that places S and T in permissible spots and introduces two new common letters.  
A good candidate is “ABOUT” but T is in position 5 which is allowed, and S is not used.

4. Letters ruled out so far: L, E, I, R, H.
5. Letters still allowed and untested among common ones: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
Letters present: S, A, T
Letters absent: L, E
Positions ruled out: 1 for S, 3 for A, 4 for T

I want a word that:
1. Uses S, A, T (confirmed present)
2. Avoids L, E (confirmed absent)
3. Places S, A, T in new positions to test their correct spots
4. Adds new common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S isn't there, so this is bad)
Next candidate: ""RAISE"" - but E is out.
Next: ""STAIN"" - but E is out and we don't know about I/N yet.
Next: ""SATIN"" - uses S, A, T plus new I, N.
Positions:
- S in 1 (invalid, same issue)
Next: ""ASTIR"" - uses A, S, T in new positions, adds I, R.
Positions:
- A in 1 (new)
- S in 2 (new)
- T in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- R in 5 (new)
This seems optimal as it tests all three known letters in fresh spots and introduces two new common letters (I, R).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 1 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- S (from SLATE it was not in position 1, from ASTIR it was not in position 2)
- T (from SLATE it was not in position 4, from ASTIR it was not in position 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- L, E, I, R.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

and must contain both S and T somewhere in positions 2-5, with the constraints:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

Possible positions for S: 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for T: 2, 5  

We still need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and we have A, S, T so far).  
These two letters must come from the remaining unused alphabet excluding L, E, I, R.

Common remaining consonants: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

Let’s try a word that places S and T in permissible spots and introduces two new common letters.  
A good candidate is “ABOUT” but T is in position 5 which is allowed, and S is not used.  
We need both S and T in the word.

Next candidate: “ACTOS” – but T is in position 3 which is forbidden.  
Next: “ADSTY” – not a valid English word.  
Next: “ASHOT” – T in 5 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed).  Uses H and O which are new letters.

“ASHOT” fits all constraints:

- S in 3 (allowed)

From the latest feedback:

- A is in position 1 (✓) – locked.
- T is in position 2 (✓) – locked.
- S is in position 5 (✓) – locked.
- M and U are NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:
A T _ _ S

Letters already ruled out: L, E, I, R, H, M, U.  
Allowed letters among common ones: B, C, D, F, G, K, N, P, O, W, Y.

From earlier rounds we also know:
- O appeared in ASHOT and was marked “-” (in word, wrong position).  
  Since ASHOT had O in position 4 and got “-”, O must be in position 3.

So position 3 is O.

Now position 4 must be a letter not yet used and not ruled out.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, K, N, P, W, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
Letters present: S, A, T
Letters absent: L, E
Positions ruled out: 1 for S, 3 for A, 4 for T

I want a word that:
1. Uses S, A, T (confirmed present)
2. Avoids L, E (confirmed absent)
3. Places S, A, T in new positions to test their correct spots
4. Adds new common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S isn't there, so this is bad)
Next candidate: ""RAISE"" - but E is out.
Next: ""STAIN"" - but E is out and we don't know about I/N yet.
Next: ""SATIN"" - uses S, A, T plus new I, N.
Positions:
- S in 1 (invalid, same issue)
Next: ""ASTIR"" - uses A, S, T in new positions, adds I, R.
Positions:
- A in 1 (new)
- S in 2 (new)
- T in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- R in 5 (new)
This seems optimal as it tests all three known letters in fresh spots and introduces two new common letters (I, R).

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 1 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- S (from SLATE it was not in position 1, from ASTIR it was not in position 2)
- T (from SLATE it was not in position 4, from ASTIR it was not in position 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- L, E, I, R.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

and must contain both S and T somewhere in positions 2-5, with the constraints:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

Possible positions for S: 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for T: 2, 5  

We still need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and we have A, S, T so far).  
These two letters must come from the remaining unused alphabet excluding L, E, I, R.

Common remaining consonants: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

Let’s try a word that places S and T in permissible spots and introduces two new common letters.  
A good candidate is “ABOUT” but T is in position 5 which is allowed, and S is not used.  
We need both S and T in the word.

Next candidate: “ACTOS” – but T is in position 3 which is forbidden.  
Next: “ADSTY” – not a valid English word.  
Next: “ASHOT” – T in 5 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed).  Uses H and O which are new letters.

“ASHOT” fits all constraints:
- A in 1 (✓)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- T in 5 (allowed)
- H and O are new letters to test.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. A is locked in position 1.
2. S must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from SLATE, ASTIR, ASHOT).
   ⇒ S can only be in position 4 or 5.
3. T must appear somewhere, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, ASTIR, ASHOT).

4. Letters ruled out so far: L, E, I, R, H.
5. Letters still allowed and untested among common ones: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

From (2) and (3) we deduce:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: T
- Position 4 or 5: S
- One remaining position (3 or 4/5) must be filled by another letter.

Possible patterns:
- A T _ S _
- A T _ _ S

We need two new letters (positions 3 and 4 or 5) from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Let’s test “ATSUM” (but M is allowed, U is allowed, S in 4).  
However, “ATSUM” is not a common English word.

Next: “ATTIC” – but I is ruled out.

Next: “ATONY” – but N and Y are allowed, O is allowed.  
“ATONY” is a valid English word meaning “lack of tone”.

Let’s check constraints:
