### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word AND in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TUBER):
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U and B are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it’s in position 5).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because R(-) in position 5 means R is present but not there).

So far:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E (and T from TUBER, but T is only confirmed in the word, not yet placed correctly).
- Letters definitely out: A, O, S, U, B.
- Positions we know:
  – E must be in position 5.
  – R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  – T must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2, 3, or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Contains T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no A, O, S, U, B).

Let’s list possible candidates:
- TREND – but N and D haven’t been tested, and D is in position 4, but we don’t know about D yet.
- TRIPE – but P hasn’t been tested, and I hasn’t been tested either.
- TRICE – but C hasn’t been tested.
- CRITE – C and I haven’t been tested.
- DRIFT – F hasn’t been tested.
- PRINT – P, I, N haven’t been tested.

A simpler approach is to look for words that fit the pattern _ T _ R E or _ R _ T E or T _ R _ E, etc., while avoiding excluded letters.

One promising word is “TRIED”:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 1).
- Letters used: T, R, I, E, D. All letters are unexcluded except I and D haven’t been tested yet.

But we don’t know about I or D yet, so this is a bit risky.

Another candidate is “CRATE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- But R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback), so this is invalid.

“DRIVE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- Again, R in position 2 is invalid.

“PRITE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 2).
- Letters: P, R, I, T, E. All letters are unexcluded so far.

This seems like a good candidate.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word AND in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TUBER):
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U and B are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it’s in position 5).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because R(-) in position 5 means R is present but not there).

So far:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E (and T from TUBER, but T is only confirmed in the word, not yet placed correctly).
- Letters definitely out: A, O, S, U, B.
- Positions we know:
  – E must be in position 5.
  – R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  – T must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2, 3, or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Contains T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no A, O, S, U, B).

Let’s list possible candidates:
- TREND – but N and D haven’t been tested, and D is in position 4, but we don’t know about D yet.
- TRIPE – but P hasn’t been tested, and I hasn’t been tested either.
- TRICE – but C hasn’t been tested.
- CRITE – C and I haven’t been tested.
- DRIFT – F hasn’t been tested.
- PRINT – P, I, N haven’t been tested.

A simpler approach is to look for words that fit the pattern _ T _ R E or _ R _ T E or T _ R _ E, etc., while avoiding excluded letters.

One promising word is “TRIED”:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 1).
- Letters used: T, R, I, E, D. All letters are unexcluded except I and D haven’t been tested yet.

But we don’t know about I or D yet, so this is a bit risky.

Another candidate is “CRATE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- But R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback), so this is invalid.

“DRIVE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- Again, R in position 2 is invalid.

“PRITE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 2).
- Letters: P, R, I, T, E. All letters are unexcluded so far.

This seems like a good candidate.

Let’s go with PRITE.

Consolidating everything we know so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- R (must appear, but NOT in positions 2, 5, or 3)
- T (must appear, but NOT in positions 1 or 4)
- E (must appear and is fixed in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, O, S, U, B, P, I

Positions:
- E is locked in position 5.
- R can only be in positions 1 or 4 (because 2, 3, 5 are excluded).
- T can only be in positions 2 or 3 (because 1, 4, 5 are excluded).

So the word structure must be:
- If R is in position 1: R _ _ _ E with T in 2 or 3.
- If R is in position 4: _ _ _ R E with T in 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. R T _ _ E
2. R _ T _ E
3. _ T R _ E
4. _ T _ R E
5. _ _ T R E

But we also know:
- No A, O, S, U, B, P, I
- Letters not yet used or excluded: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in E with R and T in positions 1 or 4 and T in 2 or 3.

Let's check pattern R T _ _ E:
- RT___E - no common words.

Pattern R _ T _ E:
- R C T D E? Not a word.
- R D T N E? Not a word.

Pattern _ T R _ E:
- C T R O E? O is excluded.
- D T R I E? I is excluded.
- F T R E? No.

Pattern _ T _ R E:
- C T H R E? Not a word.
- D T N R E? Not a word.
- G T N R E? Not a word.

Pattern _ _ T R E:
- C H T R E? Not a word.
- D N T R E? Not a word.

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe ""R"" is in position 1 and ""T"" in position 3:
R _ T _ E
Possible: R N T L E? Not a word.
R D T N E? Not a word.
R G T N E? Not a word.

Or ""R"" in position 4 and ""T"" in position 2:
_ T _ R E
Possible: C H T R E? Not a word.
D N T R E? Not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- TREND: T is in 1 (invalid), R in 2 (invalid), E in 5 ✓, but N and D are new.
- TRICE: T in 1 (invalid).
- CRATE: R in 2 (invalid).
- DRIFT: R in 3 (invalid).
- PRINT: R in 3 (invalid).
- NIGHT: R not in word.
- CHUTE: R not in word.

Actually, let me list possible positions more carefully:
R must be in 1 or 4.
T must be in 2 or 3.
E is in 5.

So possible structures:
1. R T _ _ E
2. R _ T _ E
3. _ T R _ E
4. _ T _ R E
5. _ _ T R E

But structure 3 has R in 3 (invalid), structure 1 has R in 1 ✓, structure 2 has R in 2 (invalid), structure 4 has R in 4 ✓, structure 5 has R in 4 ✓.

So valid patterns:
- R T _ _ E
- _ T _ R E
- _ _ T R E

Let's try _ T _ R E:
- C H T R E? Not a word.
- D N T R E? Not a word.
- F R T N E? Not a word.

Try _ _ T R E:
- C H T R E? Not a word.
- D N T R E? Not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""D R E A M"" - but A is excluded.
- ""C R E E K"" - but K is new, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""C R E D O"" - O excluded.
- ""C R E W S"" - S excluded.
- ""C R E E P"" - P excluded.
- ""C R E E K"" - same as above.

Actually, let me think of ""D R E A M"" - no.

Wait, let me try ""C R E E K"" - R in 2 is invalid.

Let me try ""G R E E N"" - N is new, R in 2 invalid.

Let me try ""F R E E D"" - D is new, R in 2 invalid.

Let me try ""W R E C K"" - C and K new, R in 2 invalid.

Let me try ""H A R P E"" - A and P excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains R, but R is NOT in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains R (but not in position 2).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

Let me think of possible words:
- TIGER (but has A? No, A is excluded. But TIGER has I, G, E, R. Ends in E, has R, no A/O/S. R is in position 4, which is allowed.)
- RIVER (but has A? No, but R is in position 1, which is allowed.)
- CRIME (but has A? No, but C, R, I, M, E. R is in position 2, which is NOT allowed because R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2.)
- TUBER (T, U, B, E, R. Ends in E, has R in position 5, which is allowed. No A, O, S.)

""TUBER"" seems good:
- Ends in E.
- Contains R in position 5 (not position 2).
- No A, O, S.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word AND in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TUBER):
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U and B are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it’s in position 5).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because R(-) in position 5 means R is present but not there).

So far:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E (and T from TUBER, but T is only confirmed in the word, not yet placed correctly).
- Letters definitely out: A, O, S, U, B.
- Positions we know:
  – E must be in position 5.
  – R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  – T must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2, 3, or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Contains T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no A, O, S, U, B).

Let’s list possible candidates:
- TREND – but N and D haven’t been tested, and D is in position 4, but we don’t know about D yet.
- TRIPE – but P hasn’t been tested, and I hasn’t been tested either.
- TRICE – but C hasn’t been tested.
- CRITE – C and I haven’t been tested.
- DRIFT – F hasn’t been tested.
- PRINT – P, I, N haven’t been tested.

A simpler approach is to look for words that fit the pattern _ T _ R E or _ R _ T E or T _ R _ E, etc., while avoiding excluded letters.

One promising word is “TRIED”:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 1).
- Letters used: T, R, I, E, D. All letters are unexcluded except I and D haven’t been tested yet.

But we don’t know about I or D yet, so this is a bit risky.

Another candidate is “CRATE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- But R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback), so this is invalid.

“DRIVE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- Again, R in position 2 is invalid.

“PRITE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 2).
- Letters: P, R, I, T, E. All letters are unexcluded so far.

This seems like a good candidate.

Let’s go with PRITE.

Let’s summarize everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, O, S, U, B, P, I

Letters that ARE in the word (either - or ✓):
- R (must appear at least once)
- T (must appear at least once)
- E (must appear at least once, and is confirmed in position 5)

Position constraints:
- E is in position 5 (✓ from AROSE and PRITE).
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and TUBER/PRITE).
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from TUBER and PRITE).

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ E  
with R and T somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (each must appear once).

Possible patterns:
- T R _ _ E (but T can’t be in pos 1, so invalid)
- R T _ _ E
- R _ T _ E
- R _ _ T E (but T can’t be in pos 4, so invalid)
- _ R T _ E (but T can’t be in pos 3, so invalid)
- _ R _ T E (invalid, same reason)
- _ T R _ E
- _ T _ R E (invalid, R can’t be in pos 4)
- _ _ R T E (invalid, T can’t be in pos 4)
- T _ R _ E (invalid, T can’t be in pos 1)
- etc.

The only viable patterns left are:
1. R T _ _ E
2. _ T R _ E
3. R _ T _ E
4. _ R T _ E

But we must also ensure that all letters used are from the allowed set (no A, O, S, U, B, P, I). The remaining common consonants are C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s check each pattern:

1. R T _ _ E:
   Need two more letters, not yet excluded. Possible: R T C H E → RTCHE (not a word), R T N D E → RTNDE (invalid), R T Y L E → RTYLE (invalid). Not promising.

2. _ T R _ E:
   First letter: any allowed consonant. Second: T, third: R, fourth: any allowed consonant, fifth: E.
   Example: C T R _ E → CTR_E. CTRLE (invalid), CTRDE (invalid), CTRGE (invalid). Not a word.
   N T R _ E → NTR_E. NTRBE (invalid), NTRDE (invalid). Not working.
   L T R _ E → LTR_E. LTRDE (invalid). Not working.
   F T R _ E → FTR_E. FTRDE (invalid). Not working.

3. R _ T _ E:
   R _ T _ E. Need letters in positions 2 and 4.
   R C T N E →RCTNE (invalid), R D T N E → RDTNE (invalid).
   R L T N E → RL TNE (invalid). Not working.

4. _ R T _ E:
   _ R T _ E. First letter: any allowed consonant, second: R, third: T, fourth: any allowed consonant, fifth: E.
   C R T _ E → CRT_E. CRTNE (invalid), CRTGE (invalid).
   N R T _ E → NRT_E. NRTDE (invalid).
   L R T _ E → LRT_E. LRTNE (invalid).
   D R T _ E → DRT_E. DRTNE (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Maybe I missed some letters or patterns. Let me reconsider.

Actually, the letters R and T must each appear exactly once (since they only received “-” feedback, not ✓). So the word has:
- R in position 1, 3, or 4
- T in position 1, 3, or 4
- E in position 5
- No other letters from the excluded list.

Possible positions for R and T:
- R in 1, T in 3: R T _ _ E → but T can’t be in 3 (from PRITE feedback T(-) means T is in word but not in position 4, but position 3 wasn’t tested for T yet). Wait, PRITE feedback was T(-) meaning T is in word but not in position 4. So T could be in 2 or 3.
- R in 1, T in 2: R T _ _ E
- R in 1, T in 3: R _ T _ E
- R in 3, T in 1: T _ R _ E
- R in 3, T in 2: _ T R _ E
- R in 4, T in 1: T _ _ R E
- R in 4, T in 2: _ T _ R E
- R in 4, T in 3: _ _ T R E (invalid, R can’t be in 4)

Let me check valid words:

1. R T _ _ E:
   R T C H E → RTCHE (invalid)
   R T N D E → RTNDE (invalid)
   Not a word.

2. R _ T _ E:
   R C T N E →RCTNE (invalid)
   R D T N E → RDTNE (invalid)
   Not a word.

3. T _ R _ E:
   T I R E (but I is excluded)
   T R I E (I excluded)
   T Y R E → TYRE (valid word, but Y is allowed)
   T Y R E: letters T, Y, R, E. All allowed. Check positions:
   - E is in 5 (ok)
   - R is in 3 (allowed)
   - T is in 1 (allowed, since T(-) only said T not in 4, so 1 is ok)
   - Y is new, not excluded
   - No excluded letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains R, but R is NOT in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains R (but not in position 2).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

Let me think of possible words:
- TIGER (but has A? No, A is excluded. But TIGER has I, G, E, R. Ends in E, has R, no A/O/S. R is in position 4, which is allowed.)
- RIVER (but has A? No, but R is in position 1, which is allowed.)
- CRIME (but has A? No, but C, R, I, M, E. R is in position 2, which is NOT allowed because R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2.)
- TUBER (T, U, B, E, R. Ends in E, has R in position 5, which is allowed. No A, O, S.)

""TUBER"" seems good:
- Ends in E.
- Contains R in position 5 (not position 2).
- No A, O, S.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word AND in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TUBER):
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U and B are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it’s in position 5).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because R(-) in position 5 means R is present but not there).

So far:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E (and T from TUBER, but T is only confirmed in the word, not yet placed correctly).
- Letters definitely out: A, O, S, U, B.
- Positions we know:
  – E must be in position 5.
  – R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  – T must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2, 3, or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Contains T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no A, O, S, U, B).

Let’s list possible candidates:
- TREND – but N and D haven’t been tested, and D is in position 4, but we don’t know about D yet.
- TRIPE – but P hasn’t been tested, and I hasn’t been tested either.
- TRICE – but C hasn’t been tested.
- CRITE – C and I haven’t been tested.
- DRIFT – F hasn’t been tested.
- PRINT – P, I, N haven’t been tested.

A simpler approach is to look for words that fit the pattern _ T _ R E or _ R _ T E or T _ R _ E, etc., while avoiding excluded letters.

One promising word is “TRIED”:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 1).
- Letters used: T, R, I, E, D. All letters are unexcluded except I and D haven’t been tested yet.

But we don’t know about I or D yet, so this is a bit risky.

Another candidate is “CRATE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- But R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback), so this is invalid.

“DRIVE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 2) and T (position 4).
- Again, R in position 2 is invalid.

“PRITE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 3) and T (position 2).
- Letters: P, R, I, T, E. All letters are unexcluded so far.

This seems like a good candidate.

Let’s re-state the constraints clearly after all feedback:

Letters known to be in the word:
- R (must appear once, not in positions 2 or 5)
- T (must appear once, not in positions 1 or 4)
- E (must appear once, in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, O, S, U, B, P, I

Word length: 5, ending with E.

Positions:
1: cannot be T (T(-) in position 1 from PRITE) and cannot be A,O,S,U,B,P,I
2: cannot be R (R(-) in position 2 from AROSE) and cannot be A,O,S,U,B,P,I
3: no restrictions yet except R and T must appear somewhere
4: cannot be T (T(-) in position 4 from PRITE) and cannot be A,O,S,U,B,P,I
5: must be E

So positions 1,2,3,4 must be filled with letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones) and must contain both R and T exactly once each.

Remaining consonants (not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

We need to place R and T in positions 1,3, or 4 (since they can’t be in 2 or 5).

Possible placements:
- R in 1, T in 3: R _ T _ E
- R in 1, T in 4: R _ _ T E (but T cannot be in 4, so invalid)
- R in 3, T in 1: T _ R _ E
- R in 3, T in 4: _ _ R T E (invalid, T cannot be in 4)
- R in 4, T in 1: T _ _ R E
- R in 4, T in 3: _ T R _ E
- R in 3, T in 2: invalid (T cannot be in 2 from PRITE feedback shows T(-) in position 2, but PRITE had T in position 4, so T(-) in PRITE was position 4, meaning T is not in 4, but can be in 2 or 3)

Wait, let me re-examine T positions:

From TUBER: T(-) means T is in word but not in position 1.
From PRITE: T(-) means T is in word but not in position 4.
So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, R:
From AROSE: R(-) means R is not in position 2.
From TUBER: R(-) means R is not in position 5.
From PRITE: R(-) means R is not in position 2 (same as AROSE).
So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now we know:
- T must be in position 2 or 3
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- They cannot both be in position 3, so one of these must be true:
  1. T in 2, R in 1: R T _ _ E (but R in 1 and T in 2 would be R T _ _ E, but this would have R in 1 and T in 2, which is allowed)
  2. T in 2, R in 4: _ T _ R E
  3. T in 3, R in 1: R _ T _ E
  4. T in 3, R in 4: _ _ R T E (invalid, T cannot be in 4)

So possible patterns:
- R T _ _ E
- _ T _ R E
- R _ T _ E

Let’s check each:

1. R T _ _ E:
   Need two more letters, not excluded. Possible: R T C H E → RTCHE (invalid)
   R T N D E → RTNDE (invalid)
   Not a valid word.

2. _ T _ R E:
   First letter: any allowed consonant, second: T, third: any allowed consonant, fourth: R, fifth: E.
   C T _ R E → C T _ R E. C T Y R E → CTYRE (invalid)
   N T _ R E → N T Y R E → NTYRE (invalid)
   L T _ R E → L T Y R E → LTYRE (invalid)
   D T _ R E → D T Y R E → DTYRE (invalid)
   Not a valid word.

3. R _ T _ E:
   R _ T _ E. Need letters in positions 2 and 4.
   R C T N E →RCTNE (invalid)
   R D T N E → RDTNE (invalid)
   R L T N E → RL TNE (invalid)
   Not a valid word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Maybe I need to consider more possibilities or different letters.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words ending in E with R and T somewhere, excluding the banned letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""CRATE"" – but R is in position 2 (invalid)
- ""DRATE"" – R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""FRATE"" – R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""GRATE"" – R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""TRICE"" – I is excluded
- ""TRUCE"" – U is excluded
- ""TYRE"" – but this is only 4 letters
- ""CRETE"" – R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""DITRE"" – I is excluded
- ""FRET"" – too short
- ""GREAT"" – too short
- ""METRE"" – M, E, T, R, E – but E is in position 5, and this has E in 5 and 4, but we only know E is in 5. Also T is in 3 (allowed), R is in 4 (allowed), but this has E in 4 which may not be allowed (we only know E is in 5). Also, this has E in 4 which may not be correct.
- ""METRE"" – but E is in 5, and this has E in 4 and 5. Not sure if multiple Es are allowed, but original word is 5 letters, so possible.
- ""METRE"" – letters M, E, T, R, E. All allowed letters (M not excluded). Check positions:
   - E in 5 (ok)
   - T in 3 (allowed, since T must be in 2 or 3)
   - R in 4 (allowed)
   - No banned letters
   - This is a valid word

So ""METRE"" seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains R (position 4) and T (position 3)
- No A, O, S, U, B, P, I
- R not in position 2 (ok, it's in 4)
- T not in position 1 or 4 (ok, it's in 3)
- E only in position 5 (original feedback shows E in position 5 as ✓, but does it allow other Es? The original word is 5 letters, and this has E in 4 and 5. But the feedback only confirmed E in position 5, so this may be acceptable as the secret word could have E in 5 and another E in 4. However, this is speculative.)

But ""METRE"" is a valid word. Let me see if there's another better option.

Another candidate: ""DITRE"" – but I is excluded.
""KITRE"" – I is excluded.
""MITRE"" – M, I, T, R, E – I is excluded.
""VERT"" – too short.
""FRYTE"" – Y is allowed, but this is not a common word.
""GRYTE"" – not a word.
""VERT"" – not 5 letters.

""METRE"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me check ""METRE"" more carefully:
- Letters: M, E, T, R, E
- E is in positions 4 and 5. The feedback only confirmed E in position 5 as ✓, so this could be possible if the word has two Es, one in 5 and one in 4.
- T is in 3 (allowed)
- R is in 4 (allowed)
- No banned letters

Given the constraints, ""METRE"" is the most plausible next guess.

However, another valid word is ""METRE"" or ""CRETE"" but ""CRETE"" has R in 2 (invalid). So ""METRE"" is the only valid word left.

But let me think of others:
""VERT"" – too short.
""FRYTE"" – not a word.
""GRYTE"" – not a word.
""VERT"" – not 5 letters.

Actually, ""DITRE"" is invalid (I excluded). ""KITRE"" invalid (I excluded). ""MITRE"" invalid (I excluded). ""VERT"" invalid.

Another candidate: ""GRATE"" – but R in 2 (invalid).
""TRAVE"" – A is excluded.
""TRICE"" – I excluded.
""TRUCE"" – U excluded.
""TYRE"" – 4 letters.

""METRE"" seems to be the only valid 5-letter word left fitting all constraints.

But let me think of ""VERT"" – no, 5 letters: ""VERT"" is 4. ""VERTE"" – but E is in 5, and this has E in 5 and T in 4 (invalid for T).

""METRE"" is the only valid word left.

Wait, another candidate: ""FRET"" – too short.
""GRATE"" – R in 2 (invalid).
""TRICE"" – I excluded.
""TRUCE"" – U excluded.

""METRE"" seems correct.

But let me check ""METRE"" in dictionary: yes, ""metre"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Thus, the next guess should be ""METRE"".
</think>

<guess>METRE</guess>",METRE,"Let’s re-state the constraints clearly after all feedback:

Letters known to be in the word:
- R (must appear once, not in positions 2 or 5)
- T (must appear once, not in positions 1 or 4)
- E (must appear once, in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, O, S, U, B, P, I

Word length: 5, ending with E.

Positions:
1: cannot be T (T(-) in position 1 from PRITE) and cannot be A,O,S,U,B,P,I
2: cannot be R (R(-) in position 2 from AROSE) and cannot be A,O,S,U,B,P,I
3: no restrictions yet except R and T must appear somewhere
4: cannot be T (T(-) in position 4 from PRITE) and cannot be A,O,S,U,B,P,I
5: must be E

So positions 1,2,3,4 must be filled with letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones) and must contain both R and T exactly once each.

Remaining consonants (not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

We need to place R and T in positions 1,3, or 4 (since they can’t be in 2 or 5).

Possible placements:
- R in 1, T in 3: R _ T _ E
- R in 1, T in 4: R _ _ T E (but T cannot be in 4, so invalid)
- R in 3, T in 1: T _ R _ E
- R in 3, T in 4: _ _ R T E (invalid, T cannot be in 4)
- R in 4, T in 1: T _ _ R E
- R in 4, T in 3: _ T R _ E
- R in 3, T in 2: invalid (T cannot be in 2 from PRITE feedback shows T(-) in position 2, but PRITE had T in position 4, so T(-) in PRITE was position 4, meaning T is not in 4, but can be in 2 or 3)

Wait, let me re-examine T positions:

From TUBER: T(-) means T is in word but not in position 1.
From PRITE: T(-) means T is in word but not in position 4.
So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, R:
From AROSE: R(-) means R is not in position 2.
From TUBER: R(-) means R is not in position 5.
From PRITE: R(-) means R is not in position 2 (same as AROSE).
So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now we know:
- T must be in position 2 or 3
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- They cannot both be in position 3, so one of these must be true:
  1. T in 2, R in 1: R T _ _ E (but R in 1 and T in 2 would be R T _ _ E, but this would have R in 1 and T in 2, which is allowed)
  2. T in 2, R in 4: _ T _ R E
  3. T in 3, R in 1: R _ T _ E
  4. T in 3, R in 4: _ _ R T E (invalid, T cannot be in 4)

So possible patterns:
- R T _ _ E
- _ T _ R E
- R _ T _ E

Let’s check each:

1. R T _ _ E:
   Need two more letters, not excluded. Possible: R T C H E → RTCHE (invalid)
   R T N D E → RTNDE (invalid)
   Not a valid word.

2. _ T _ R E:

   C T _ R E → C T _ R E. C T Y R E → CTYRE (invalid)
   N T _ R E → N T Y R E → NTYRE (invalid)

- ""METRE"" – but E is in 5, and this has E in 4 and 5. Not sure if multiple Es are allowed, but original word is 5 letters, so possible.
- ""METRE"" – letters M, E, T, R, E. All allowed letters (M not excluded). Check positions:
   - E in 5 (ok)
   - T in 3 (allowed, since T must be in 2 or 3)
   - R in 4 (allowed)
   - No banned letters
   - This is a valid word

So ""METRE"" seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains R (position 4) and T (position 3)
- No A, O, S, U, B, P, I
- R not in position 2 (ok, it's in 4)
- T not in position 1 or 4 (ok, it's in 3)
- E only in position 5 (original feedback shows E in position 5 as ✓, but does it allow other Es? The original word is 5 letters, and this has E in 4 and 5. But the feedback only confirmed E in position 5, so this may be acceptable as the secret word could have E in 5 and another E in 4. However, this is speculative.)

But ""METRE"" is a valid word. Let me see if there's another better option.

Another candidate: ""DITRE"" – but I is excluded.
""KITRE"" – I is excluded.
""MITRE"" – M, I, T, R, E – I is excluded.
""VERT"" – too short.
""FRYTE"" – Y is allowed, but this is not a common word.
""GRYTE"" – not a word.
""VERT"" – not 5 letters.

""METRE"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me check ""METRE"" more carefully:
- Letters: M, E, T, R, E
- E is in positions 4 and 5. The feedback only confirmed E in position 5 as ✓, so this could be possible if the word has two Es, one in 5 and one in 4.
- T is in 3 (allowed)
- R is in 4 (allowed)
- No banned letters

Given the constraints, ""METRE"" is the most plausible next guess.

However, another valid word is ""METRE"" or ""CRETE"" but ""CRETE"" has R in 2 (invalid). So ""METRE"" is the only valid word left.

But let me think of others:
""VERT"" – too short.
""FRYTE"" – not a word.
""GRYTE"" – not a word.
""VERT"" – not 5 letters.

Actually, ""DITRE"" is invalid (I excluded). ""KITRE"" invalid (I excluded). ""MITRE"" invalid (I excluded). ""VERT"" invalid.

Another candidate: ""GRATE"" – but R in 2 (invalid).
""TRAVE"" – A is excluded.
""TRICE"" – I excluded.
""TRUCE"" – U excluded.
""TYRE"" – 4 letters.

""METRE"" seems to be the only valid 5-letter word left fitting all constraints.

But let me think of ""VERT"" – no, 5 letters: ""VERT"" is 4. ""VERTE"" – but E is in 5, and this has E in 5 and T in 4 (invalid for T).

""METRE"" is the only valid word left.

Wait, another candidate: ""FRET"" – too short.
""GRATE"" – R in 2 (invalid).
""TRICE"" – I excluded.
""TRUCE"" – U excluded.

""METRE"" seems correct.

But let me check ""METRE"" in dictionary: yes, ""metre"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Thus, the next guess should be ""METRE"".",Guess 6: METRE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
