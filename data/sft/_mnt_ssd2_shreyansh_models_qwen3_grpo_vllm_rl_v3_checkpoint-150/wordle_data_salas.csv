For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in both positions and as standalone letters. It should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in both positions and as standalone letters. It should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- T and E are not in the word at all (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.
- Does not contain T or E.

Possible positions for L: 3,4,5 (since 2 is wrong and 1 is S).
Possible positions for A: 2,4,5 (since 3 is wrong and 1 is S).

I want a new word that:
- Starts with S.
- Uses L and A in new positions.
- Avoids T and E.
- Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good candidates: SALAD (but repeats A), SLAIN (uses I), SALON (uses O), SALAD (again), SALSA (repeats S and A).

SLAIN seems good - it uses L in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback), so skip.
SALON: L in 3, A in 2 - both positions are allowed. Uses O and N which are common.
SALAD: A repeats, not ideal.
SALSA: S repeats, not ideal.

Best seems SALON:
- S(✓) in position 1.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- O and N are new letters to test.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SALON:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓).
- A is correct in position 2 (✓).
- L is correct in position 3 (✓).
- O and N are not in the word (x).

So the word pattern is now: S A L _ _

We know the last two letters are not T, E, O, or N.

Common letters left to test: R, D, C, K, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Possible endings:
- SALAD (but D is possible)
- SALSA (but S is already used)
- SALTY (but T and Y - T is out)
- SALCH (but CH is uncommon)
- SALAD seems possible, but A is already in position 2.
- SALPY (but P and Y - possible)
- SALMY (but M and Y - possible)
- SALIG (but I and G - possible)

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with SAL:
- SALAD
- SALTY (invalid due to T)
- SALON (already used)
- SALSA (invalid due to S repetition)
- SALCH (not a common word)
- SALPY (not a common word)
- SALMY (not a common word)

The most common word fitting the pattern is SALAD, but we have A already in position 2. SALAD would be S A L A D, but that repeats A. However, the feedback didn't say A isn't in position 4, just that A is in position 2 correctly. So SALAD is possible.

Another option is SALDR (but not a word), or SALCH (not common).

Given the constraints, SALAD is the most likely word.The pattern is now S A L _ _. The only common word fitting this is SALAD.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in both positions and as standalone letters. It should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

- T and E are not in the word at all (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.
- Does not contain T or E.

Possible positions for L: 3,4,5 (since 2 is wrong and 1 is S).
Possible positions for A: 2,4,5 (since 3 is wrong and 1 is S).

I want a new word that:
- Starts with S.
- Uses L and A in new positions.
- Avoids T and E.
- Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good candidates: SALAD (but repeats A), SLAIN (uses I), SALON (uses O), SALAD (again), SALSA (repeats S and A).

SLAIN seems good - it uses L in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback), so skip.
SALON: L in 3, A in 2 - both positions are allowed. Uses O and N which are common.
SALAD: A repeats, not ideal.

- SALCH (but CH is uncommon)
- SALAD seems possible, but A is already in position 2.
- SALPY (but P and Y - possible)
- SALMY (but M and Y - possible)
- SALIG (but I and G - possible)

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with SAL:
- SALAD
- SALTY (invalid due to T)
- SALON (already used)
- SALSA (invalid due to S repetition)
- SALCH (not a common word)
- SALPY (not a common word)
- SALMY (not a common word)

The most common word fitting the pattern is SALAD, but we have A already in position 2. SALAD would be S A L A D, but that repeats A. However, the feedback didn't say A isn't in position 4, just that A is in position 2 correctly. So SALAD is possible.

Another option is SALDR (but not a word), or SALCH (not common).

Given the constraints, SALAD is the most likely word.The pattern is now S A L _ _. The only common word fitting this is SALAD.

Current knowledge:
- Fixed letters: S A L A _ (positions 1-4 are correct)
- The last letter must not be: T, E, O, N, D
- It must be a valid 5-letter word that ends with a letter not in {T, E, O, N, D}

Possible last letters (common ones not excluded): B, C, G, K, M, P, R, S, Y, etc.

Looking at common words that start with ""SAL"":
- SALAD (already tried, ends with D - excluded)
- SALTY (ends with Y - possible)
- SALON (already tried, ends with N - excluded)
- SALSA (ends with A - but position 4 is already A, and we don't know if A can repeat)
- SALCH (not a word)
- SALPY (not a word)
- SALSM (not a word)
- SALBP (not a word)

The only remaining common word is SALTY, which ends with Y - none of the excluded letters.

We now know the first four letters are S A L A and the fifth letter is **not** T, E, O, N, D, or Y.

So the pattern is: S A L A _

Remaining common consonants not yet ruled out:  
B, C, G, K, M, P, R, S, W, etc.

A quick check of 5-letter words that start with “SAL” and end with one of these consonants:

- **SALAB** – not a standard word  
- **SALAC** – not a word  
- **SALAG** – not a word  
- **SALAM** – valid (a type of moth)  
- **SALAP** – not a word  
- **SALAR** – not standard (means “salary” in some contexts but not common)  
- **SALAS** – plural of “sala” (a small room) but uncommon  
- **SALAS** – same as above  

The only clearly valid and common word left is **SALAM**.
