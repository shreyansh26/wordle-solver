For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)

These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers many common vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains S and L, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does not contain A, T, or E
- Has 3 other letters besides S and L

Since A, T, E are out, we need to find other vowels. Possible vowels left: I, O, U
Common consonants left: R, N, D, M, P, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S and L but move them to new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid A, T, E

Possible candidates:
- RISKY (but has Y, which is less common)
- SNORL (but N is in position 3, which is okay)
- FLOSS (but has S twice, which might waste info)
- CROPS (but has P, which is less common)

I'll go with ""SNORL"" as it moves S to position 2 and L to position 5, and introduces N, O, R which are common letters.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me think differently – maybe the word has S, L, N plus another vowel or consonant.

Possible letters left: I, U, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to find a valid word:

- ""SINUL"" – not a word.
- ""LUNIS"" – has S in position 5, L in position 1, N in position 3, and I in position 2 and 4 – but it's ""LUNIS"" which is a valid word (a type of fish).

Let’s check ""LUNIS"":
- Letters: L, U, N, I, S
- Contains S, L, N
- Doesn’t contain A, T, E, O, R
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1)
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L can’t be in 2 or 5)
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since N can’t be in 2)

""LUNIS"" seems to fit all constraints.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me think differently – maybe the word has S, L, N plus another vowel or consonant.

Possible letters left: I, U, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to find a valid word:
- ""SUNIL"" – but S is in position 1, which is invalid.
- ""SINUL"" – not a word.
- ""LUNIS"" – has S in position 5, L in position 1, N in position 3, and I in position 2 and 4 – but it's ""LUNIS"" which is a valid word (a type of fish).

Let’s check ""LUNIS"":
- Letters: L, U, N, I, S
- Contains S, L, N
- Doesn’t contain A, T, E, O, R
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1)
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L can’t be in 2 or 5)
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since N can’t be in 2)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)

These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers many common vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains S and L, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does not contain A, T, or E
- Has 3 other letters besides S and L

Since A, T, E are out, we need to find other vowels. Possible vowels left: I, O, U
Common consonants left: R, N, D, M, P, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S and L but move them to new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid A, T, E

Possible candidates:
- RISKY (but has Y, which is less common)
- SNORL (but N is in position 3, which is okay)
- FLOSS (but has S twice, which might waste info)
- CROPS (but has P, which is less common)

I'll go with ""SNORL"" as it moves S to position 2 and L to position 5, and introduces N, O, R which are common letters.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SNORL → S(-) N(-) O(x) R(x) L(-)
   - S is still in the word, but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - N is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - O and R are not in the word.
   - L is in the word, but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, L, N
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, R
- Positions ruled out:
  - S cannot be in position 1
  - L cannot be in position 2 or 5
  - N cannot be in position 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, N
- Does NOT contain A, T, E, O, R
- Has S not in position 1, L not in positions 2 or 5, N not in position 2

Let’s list possible letters left (excluding the ruled-out ones):
Vowels left: I, U
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place S, L, N plus two more letters from the remaining pool.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for L: 1,3,4
Possible positions for N: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- S must be in 2,3,4, or 5
- L must be in 1,3,4
- N must be in 1,3,4,5

Let’s try placing S in position 2, L in position 1, N in position 3:
L S N _ _

We need two more letters, not A,T,E,O,R. Let’s pick I and D (common letters):
L S N I D → ""LSNID"" – not a valid word.

Let’s try S in position 3, L in position 1, N in position 2:
L N S _ _

Need two more letters. Let’s try I and D:
L N S I D – ""LNSID"" – not valid.

L _ N S _

Need a letter for position 2. Let’s try I:

From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1
   - L is in the word, not in position 2
   - A, T, E are not in the word

2. SNORL → S(-) N(-) O(x) R(x) L(-)
   - S is still in the word, not in position 1
   - N is in the word, not in position 2
   - O, R are not in the word
   - L is in the word, not in position 5

3. LUNIS → L(-) U(x) N(-) I(-) S(✓)
   - L is in the word, not in position 1
   - U is not in the word
   - N is in the word, not in position 3
   - I is in the word, not in position 4
   - S is in the correct position 5

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (position 5), L, N, I
- Letters not in the word: A, T, E, O, R, U
- Positions ruled out:
  - S: only position 5 is confirmed correct
  - L: cannot be in positions 1 or 2
  - N: cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  - I: cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains L, N, I and does not contain A, T, E, O, R, U.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list positions:
1: cannot be L (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
2: cannot be N (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
3: cannot be N (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
4: cannot be I (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
5: must be S

So positions 1-4 must be filled with L, N, I plus one more letter from the remaining pool, without repeating letters.

We have:
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 2)
- N must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3)
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4)

Let’s try to place them:
Option 1:
1: N
2: I
3: L
4: ?

Need a letter for position 4 that hasn’t been used and is allowed. Let’s try D:
N I L D S → ""NILD S"" – but ""NILD"" isn’t a valid stem.

Option 2:
1: I
2: N
3: L
4: ?

""N I L D S"" – same issue.

Option 3:
1: N
2: ?
3: I
4: L

Need a letter for position 2. Let’s try C:
N C I L S – ""NCILS"" – not valid.

Option 4:

2: ?
3: N
4: L

Need a letter for position 2. Let’s try C:

Option 5:

Need a letter for position 3. Let’s try D:

Option 6:
1: ?

Need a letter for position 1. Let’s try C:

Option 7:

2: N
3: I

C N I L S – ""CNILS"" – not valid.

Option 8:
1: ?
2: ?
3: I
4: N
5: S

But N must be in position 1 or 4, and we haven’t placed it yet.

Let’s try:
1: N
2: I
3: ?
4: L

Need a letter for position 3. Let’s try D:

Let’s try X:

Let’s try D:

Let’s try Y:

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me try a different approach.

We have:
- Letters to place: L, N, I
- Positions:
  1: cannot be L, N, S (S is at 5)
  2: cannot be N, S
  3: cannot be N, S
  4: cannot be I, S
  5: must be S

So:
- L must be in position 3 or 4
- N must be in position 1 or 4
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 3

This is frustrating. Let me try a different approach – maybe the word has a repeated letter or I missed a possibility.

Wait, let me list all possible 5-letter words ending in S that contain L, N, I and avoid A, T, E, O, R, U.

Possible candidates:
- ""INLKS"" – not valid
- ""NILLS"" – contains S twice, but let's check: N I L L S
  - Has N, I, L, S
  - Doesn't have A, T, E, O, R, U
  - S is at position 5 (correct)
  - L is at position 4 (allowed, since L can't be 1 or 2)
  - N is at position 1 (allowed, since N can't be 2 or 3)
  - I is at position 2 (allowed, since I can't be 4)
  - This seems to fit all constraints!

""NILLS"" is a valid word (meaning to chip or flake off in small pieces).

Let me verify:
- Letters: N, I, L, L, S
- Contains S (position 5), L (positions 3 and 4), N (position 1), I (position 2)
- Doesn't contain A, T, E, O, R, U
- S is correct at 5
- L is not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3 and 4) – allowed
- N is not in 2 or 3 (it's in 1) – allowed
- I is not in 4 (it's in 2) – allowed

This seems to satisfy all constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must:
- End with S (position 5)
- Contain L, N, I
- Not contain A, T, E, O, R, U
- Have L not in positions 1 or 2
- Have N not in positions 2 or 3
- Have I not in position 4

After checking possible combinations, the word ""NILLS"" fits all these constraints.

<guess>NILLS</guess>",NILLS,"From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1
   - L is in the word, not in position 2
   - A, T, E are not in the word

2. SNORL → S(-) N(-) O(x) R(x) L(-)
   - S is still in the word, not in position 1
   - N is in the word, not in position 2
   - O, R are not in the word
   - L is in the word, not in position 5

3. LUNIS → L(-) U(x) N(-) I(-) S(✓)
   - L is in the word, not in position 1
   - U is not in the word
   - N is in the word, not in position 3
   - I is in the word, not in position 4
   - S is in the correct position 5

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (position 5), L, N, I
- Letters not in the word: A, T, E, O, R, U
- Positions ruled out:
  - S: only position 5 is confirmed correct
  - L: cannot be in positions 1 or 2
  - N: cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  - I: cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains L, N, I and does not contain A, T, E, O, R, U.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list positions:
1: cannot be L (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
2: cannot be N (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
3: cannot be N (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
4: cannot be I (ruled out), cannot be S (already at 5)
5: must be S

So positions 1-4 must be filled with L, N, I plus one more letter from the remaining pool, without repeating letters.

We have:
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 2)
- N must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3)
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4)

Let’s try to place them:
Option 1:
1: N
2: I
3: L
4: ?

Need a letter for position 4 that hasn’t been used and is allowed. Let’s try D:
N I L D S → ""NILD S"" – but ""NILD"" isn’t a valid stem.

Option 2:
1: I
2: N
3: L
4: ?

""N I L D S"" – same issue.

Option 3:
1: N
2: ?
3: I

But N must be in position 1 or 4, and we haven’t placed it yet.

Let’s try:

Let’s try D:

Let’s try Y:

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me try a different approach.

We have:

- Positions:
  1: cannot be L, N, S (S is at 5)
  2: cannot be N, S
  3: cannot be N, S
  4: cannot be I, S
  5: must be S

So:

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a letter or position.

Wait, let me list all possible positions:

We have:
- S is fixed at position 5
- L must be in 3 or 4
- N must be in 1 or 4
- I must be in 1, 2, or 3
- One more letter needed from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

This is frustrating. Let me try a different approach – maybe the word has a repeated letter or I missed a possibility.

Wait, let me list all possible 5-letter words ending in S that contain L, N, I and avoid A, T, E, O, R, U.

Possible candidates:
- ""INLKS"" – not valid
- ""NILLS"" – contains S twice, but let's check: N I L L S
  - Has N, I, L, S
  - Doesn't have A, T, E, O, R, U
  - S is at position 5 (correct)
  - L is at position 4 (allowed, since L can't be 1 or 2)
  - N is at position 1 (allowed, since N can't be 2 or 3)
  - I is at position 2 (allowed, since I can't be 4)
  - This seems to fit all constraints!

""NILLS"" is a valid word (meaning to chip or flake off in small pieces).

Let me verify:
- Letters: N, I, L, L, S
- Contains S (position 5), L (positions 3 and 4), N (position 1), I (position 2)
- Doesn't contain A, T, E, O, R, U
- S is correct at 5
- L is not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3 and 4) – allowed
- N is not in 2 or 3 (it's in 1) – allowed
- I is not in 4 (it's in 2) – allowed

This seems to satisfy all constraints.Based on the feedback, the word must:
- End with S (position 5)
- Contain L, N, I
- Not contain A, T, E, O, R, U
- Have L not in positions 1 or 2
- Have N not in positions 2 or 3
- Have I not in position 4

After checking possible combinations, the word ""NILLS"" fits all these constraints.",Guess 4: NILLS -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
