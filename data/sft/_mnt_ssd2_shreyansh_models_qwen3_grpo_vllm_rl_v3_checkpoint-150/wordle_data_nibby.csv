### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

None of the letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) appear in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller pool of consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the most common letters that still remain are: R, O, I, N, C, H, U, M, K, D.

A good second guess should use as many of these high-frequency remaining letters as possible while avoiding the eliminated ones.  
A strong candidate is “CHURN” (C, H, U, R, N) – it uses five fresh, fairly common letters and doesn’t repeat any. This will give us new information about the presence of C, H, U, R, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
None of the letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) appear in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller pool of consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the most common letters that still remain are: R, O, I, N, C, H, U, M, K, D.

A good second guess should use as many of these high-frequency remaining letters as possible while avoiding the eliminated ones.  
A strong candidate is “CHURN” (C, H, U, R, N) – it uses five fresh, fairly common letters and doesn’t repeat any. This will give us new information about the presence of C, H, U, R, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:

Looking at remaining letters, the most frequent are: I, O, K, M, D, G, B, F, P, W

Some popular strategic starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

From the feedback so far:

Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, U, R, G, O, F, K  
Letters confirmed: I (position 2), Y (position 5)  
Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position: N (from CHURN and BINGO/FINKY)

So the secret word looks like: _ I _ _ Y  
and it must contain N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since N has been ruled out of positions 3 and 5).

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need to place N in positions 1, 3, or 4 and fill the remaining two slots with the available letters.

Possible candidates:
- N I _ _ Y: NINNY (but double N might be unlikely)
- _ I N _ Y: PINNY (P is available, but double N again)
- _ I _ N Y: MINNY (M is available)

Let’s pick ""MINNY"" because:
- M and N are both still possible
- It places N in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters are from the remaining pool
- It’s a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback so far:

- Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, U, R, G, O, F, K, M  
- Letters confirmed: I (position 2), Y (position 5)  
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position: N (from every appearance it has been marked “-”)

The secret word pattern is: _ I _ _ Y  
and it must contain N exactly once, placed in position 1 or 3 (it cannot be in 4 because the fourth letter would then be N and the feedback for MINNY showed the second N in position 4 as “-”, meaning N is not in position 4).

So N must be in position 1 or 3.

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, J, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Case 1: N in position 1 → N I _ _ Y  
Possible words: NINNY (but we already saw the double-N issue), NIPPY (double P unlikely), NIXNY (invalid), NIVNY (invalid)… only “NINNY” is a word, but it has two Ns and we only know N is in the word once. So this case seems unlikely.

Case 2: N in position 3 → _ I N _ Y  
Possible words: PINNY (double N again at positions 3 and 4, but feedback for MINNY showed position 4 as “-”, so position 4 cannot be N. Thus PINNY is invalid because it has N in position 4.  
Next: DINNY (D is available, N in 3, Y in 5, and no double N) – this fits all constraints.

Therefore, the only valid remaining candidate is DINNY.
