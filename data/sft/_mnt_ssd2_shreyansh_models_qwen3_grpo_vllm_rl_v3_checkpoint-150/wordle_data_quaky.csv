For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good first guess should cover a mix of these letters without repeating any to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This combination helps quickly identify which vowels and common consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial. After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems like the optimal first guess to gather maximum information.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not in slot 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): these four letters are NOT in the secret word at all.

So we now know:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. We still have no information about 17 other letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Contains A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Uses as many new, high-frequency letters as possible to maximize information gain.

Good next candidates use letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.  
A strong choice is “TAINT”:
- T, N, I are high-frequency consonants/vowels we haven’t tested.
- A is in position 2 (so we’ll check if it belongs there or needs to move).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word and avoids every excluded letter.

Other possibilities like “PAINT”, “FAINT”, “CAINT” are also valid, but “TAINT” feels slightly more common.

- Uses only letters from the “still possible” list above.
- Uses as many new, high-frequency letters as possible to maximize information.

A word that satisfies these constraints and covers several new letters is “PLUMB”:

- A is in position 5, which is allowed.
- It is a valid 5-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good first guess should cover a mix of these letters without repeating any to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This combination helps quickly identify which vowels and common consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial. After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems like the optimal first guess to gather maximum information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not in slot 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): these four letters are NOT in the secret word at all.

So we now know:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. We still have no information about 17 other letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Contains A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Uses as many new, high-frequency letters as possible to maximize information gain.

Good next candidates use letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.  
A strong choice is “TAINT”:
- T, N, I are high-frequency consonants/vowels we haven’t tested.
- A is in position 2 (so we’ll check if it belongs there or needs to move).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word and avoids every excluded letter.

Other possibilities like “PAINT”, “FAINT”, “CAINT” are also valid, but “TAINT” feels slightly more common.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. TAINT → T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - A is again in the word, but not in position 2.
   - T, I, N are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters that are OUT: R, O, S, E, T, I, N  
- Letter A is in the word, but it cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- Remaining candidate positions for A: 3, 4, or 5.

We still have not tested:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” list above.
- Uses as many new, high-frequency letters as possible to maximize information.

Good remaining high-frequency letters: L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y.

A word that satisfies these constraints and covers several new letters is “PLUMB”:
- P, L, U, M, B are all new letters.
- A is in position 5, which is allowed.
- It is a valid 5-letter word.

Alternative candidates could be “CLAMP”, “CUBBY”, “GULAG”, etc., but “PLUMB” seems to give a good spread of consonants and a vowel (U).

Therefore, I’ll guess PLUMB.

   - U is in the word, not in position 3.  
   - P, L, M, B are out.

4. QUACK → Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(-)  
   - Q is correct in position 1.  
   - U is correct in position 2.  
   - A is correct in position 3.  
   - C is not in the word.  
   - K is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Q _ A _ _ (positions 1,3 fixed)
- U is confirmed in position 2 → Q U A _ _
- Letters still needed: positions 4 and 5.
- Letters that are out: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, P, L, M, B, C.
- Letters that are in but not yet placed: K (must be in position 4 or 5).

Remaining possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Y, Z, K.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with QUA and ends with one of K or another letter, with K possibly in position 4 or 5.

Possible endings:
- QUA _ K
- QUA K _

Looking at valid English words:
- QUARK (position 4: A, position 5: K) – but A is already in position 3.
- QUAKK – not a valid word.
- QUADS – D is allowed, but no K.
- QUAGM – not a word.
- QUASH – H is allowed, but no K.

Wait, let's think differently. We have Q U A _ _. K must be in position 4 or 5.

Valid words:
- QUACK – already tried, C is out.
- QUAGG – G is allowed, but double G seems unlikely.
- QUADS – no K.
- QUAKE – E is out.
- QUARK – K in position 5, but A is in position 3, so Q U A R K – but R is out.

Actually, let's list possible combinations:
- Q U A _ _ with K in position 4 or 5.

Possible:
- Q U A K _ – but we need a 5-letter word. K in position 4: Q U A K _, but we need a letter for position 5 from remaining: D, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- QUAKY – Y is allowed, and this is a valid word (meaning ""relating to quaker"").

Check letters:
- Q, U, A, K, Y – all allowed (none are out except C).
- Positions: Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) K(✓) Y(?). K is in the word but not in position 5 (from feedback), so K must be in position 4. Thus, Q U A K Y fits: K in position 4, Y in position 5.

This seems correct.
