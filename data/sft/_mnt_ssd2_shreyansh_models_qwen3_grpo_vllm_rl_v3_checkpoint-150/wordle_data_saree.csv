For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and is a valid word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in first position (S _ _ _ _)
- E is correct in fifth position (S _ _ _ E)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3)
- L and T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with S and ends with E.
2. Contains the letter A, but A is not in position 3.
3. Does not contain L or T.

Possible positions for A: 2nd or 4th (since 3rd is excluded).

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words fitting S _ _ A E or S _ A _ E.

- SPARE: S P A R E → contains R (possible), but we don’t know if R is in word yet.
- SHARE: S H A R E → contains H and R.
- SNARE: S N A R E → contains N and R.
- STARE: ruled out (T is not in word).
- SCARE: S C A R E → contains C and R.

Since we have no info on C, H, N, R yet, any of these could be valid. I’ll pick “SHARE” because H and R are common letters we haven’t tested yet.

But wait—let’s verify:
- S is fixed in 1st.
- E is fixed in 5th.
- A must appear somewhere, and in SHARE it’s in 3rd, but we know A is NOT in 3rd from feedback (A(-) in SLATE). So SHARE is invalid because A would be in 3rd position again.

Next option: SNARE. A is in 3rd again—also invalid.

Next: SCARE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SPARE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SFAKE. Not a valid word.

Next: SBAKE. Not valid.

Next: SNAKE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SMARE. Not a valid word.

Next: SWARE. Not valid.

Wait, let’s list all valid words with S _ _ A E or S _ A _ E.

Valid 5-letter words ending in E, starting with S, containing A not in 3rd:

- SHARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- SNARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- SCARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- STARE (invalid, T excluded)
- SLATE (already guessed)

Hmm, none of these have A in 2nd or 4th. Let me rethink.

Actually, the word could be S A _ _ E or S _ _ A E, but A is not in 3rd. So possible patterns:
- S A _ _ E (A in 2nd)
- S _ _ A E (A in 4th)

Let’s find words fitting S A _ _ E:
- SAUCE: S A U C E → contains U and C.
- SABLE: S A B L E → but L is excluded.
- SADDY: not valid.
- SAINT: not ending with E.

Words fitting S _ _ A E:
- S P A R E (A in 3rd—invalid)
- S C A R E (A in 3rd—invalid)
- S N A R E (A in 3rd—invalid)

Wait, no valid words seem to fit S _ _ A E with A not in 3rd. Let me check S A _ _ E instead.

SAUCE: S A U C E → A in 2nd (valid), no L or T, and we haven’t tested U or C yet.

This seems like the best next guess to test new letters while satisfying constraints.

Based on the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- E is correct in position 5
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- L and T are not in the word

The word must be S _ _ _ E with A somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and is a valid word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in first position (S _ _ _ _)
- E is correct in fifth position (S _ _ _ E)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3)
- L and T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with S and ends with E.
2. Contains the letter A, but A is not in position 3.
3. Does not contain L or T.

Possible positions for A: 2nd or 4th (since 3rd is excluded).

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words fitting S _ _ A E or S _ A _ E.

- SPARE: S P A R E → contains R (possible), but we don’t know if R is in word yet.
- SHARE: S H A R E → contains H and R.
- SNARE: S N A R E → contains N and R.
- STARE: ruled out (T is not in word).
- SCARE: S C A R E → contains C and R.

Since we have no info on C, H, N, R yet, any of these could be valid. I’ll pick “SHARE” because H and R are common letters we haven’t tested yet.

But wait—let’s verify:
- S is fixed in 1st.
- E is fixed in 5th.
- A must appear somewhere, and in SHARE it’s in 3rd, but we know A is NOT in 3rd from feedback (A(-) in SLATE). So SHARE is invalid because A would be in 3rd position again.

Next option: SNARE. A is in 3rd again—also invalid.

Next: SCARE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SPARE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SFAKE. Not a valid word.

Next: SBAKE. Not valid.

Next: SCAPE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SCAPE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SNAKE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Next: SMARE. Not a valid word.

Next: SWARE. Not valid.

Next: SCAPE. A in 3rd—invalid.

Wait, let’s list all valid words with S _ _ A E or S _ A _ E.

Valid 5-letter words ending in E, starting with S, containing A not in 3rd:
- SPARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- SHARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- SNARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- SCARE (A in 3rd—invalid)
- STARE (invalid, T excluded)
- SLATE (already guessed)

Hmm, none of these have A in 2nd or 4th. Let me rethink.

Actually, the word could be S A _ _ E or S _ _ A E, but A is not in 3rd. So possible patterns:
- S A _ _ E (A in 2nd)
- S _ _ A E (A in 4th)

Let’s find words fitting S A _ _ E:
- SAUCE: S A U C E → contains U and C.
- SABLE: S A B L E → but L is excluded.
- SADDY: not valid.
- SAINT: not ending with E.

Words fitting S _ _ A E:
- S P A R E (A in 3rd—invalid)
- S C A R E (A in 3rd—invalid)
- S N A R E (A in 3rd—invalid)

Wait, no valid words seem to fit S _ _ A E with A not in 3rd. Let me check S A _ _ E instead.

SAUCE: S A U C E → A in 2nd (valid), no L or T, and we haven’t tested U or C yet.

This seems like the best next guess to test new letters while satisfying constraints.Based on the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- E is correct in position 5
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- L and T are not in the word

The word must be S _ _ _ E with A somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

A good next guess is ""SAUCE"" which places A in position 2 and tests new letters U and C.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that haven’t been ruled out. Remaining common letters include R, N, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.

Possible words:
- S A R _ E → SARKE (invalid), SARGE (invalid), SARI E (invalid)
- S A N _ E → SANE (too short), SANER (invalid), SANGE (invalid)
- S A P _ E → SAPPE (invalid), SAPSE (invalid)

- S A D _ E → SADIE (invalid), SADGE (invalid)
- S A H _ E → SAHCE (invalid)
- S A R K E → SARKE (invalid)
- S A R G E → SARGE (valid word)

SARGE is a valid 5-letter word (short for sergeant) that fits the pattern S A _ _ E and uses letters not yet ruled out (R, G).

Let’s verify:
- S (pos 1) ✓
- A (pos 2) ✓
