For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which can quickly reveal information about the secret word's letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) while placing S in a different position. A good candidate is a word like ""POINT"" or ""SOUND"", but I need to ensure S is moved to a new spot and avoid the excluded letters. 

""SOUND"" uses S (now in position 1), common consonants N and D, and the vowel U. However, D is less common. ""STONY"" uses S in position 1, T, N, Y, and O is already fixed in position 3, but Y isn't ideal. 

""POINT"" has P, I, N, T, O. O is correct in position 3, but P and I are good letters to test. However, S is not included here. 

""SOFTY"" has S in position 1, O in 3, F and T are new consonants, Y is questionable. 

""SNOUT"" has S in position 1, N, O in 3, U, T. This seems good - tests S, N, U, T while keeping O in place.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which can quickly reveal information about the secret word's letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) while placing S in a different position. A good candidate is a word like ""POINT"" or ""SOUND"", but I need to ensure S is moved to a new spot and avoid the excluded letters. 

""SOUND"" uses S (now in position 1), common consonants N and D, and the vowel U. However, D is less common. ""STONY"" uses S in position 1, T, N, Y, and O is already fixed in position 3, but Y isn't ideal. 

""POINT"" has P, I, N, T, O. O is correct in position 3, but P and I are good letters to test. However, S is not included here. 

""SOFTY"" has S in position 1, O in 3, F and T are new consonants, Y is questionable. 

""SNOUT"" has S in position 1, N, O in 3, U, T. This seems good - tests S, N, U, T while keeping O in place. 

I'll go with ""SNOUT"".

Guess 2: SNOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the word and in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SNOUT → S(✓) N(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
   - S is now confirmed in position 1.
   - O is again confirmed in position 3.
   - N, U, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is now: S _ O _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, N, U, T.

Letters we still need to test: common ones like I, C, L, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. We should pick letters that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet. 

Good candidates for position 2: I, C, L, D, G, H, M, P
Good candidates for position 5: Y, D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that uses common letters not yet tested. ""SPOIL"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (confirmed)
- P in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (confirmed)
- I in position 4 (new)
- L in position 5 (new)

This tests P, I, L and keeps S and O in place. It also avoids all excluded letters.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which can quickly reveal information about the secret word's letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) while placing S in a different position. A good candidate is a word like ""POINT"" or ""SOUND"", but I need to ensure S is moved to a new spot and avoid the excluded letters. 

""SOUND"" uses S (now in position 1), common consonants N and D, and the vowel U. However, D is less common. ""STONY"" uses S in position 1, T, N, Y, and O is already fixed in position 3, but Y isn't ideal. 

""POINT"" has P, I, N, T, O. O is correct in position 3, but P and I are good letters to test. However, S is not included here. 

""SOFTY"" has S in position 1, O in 3, F and T are new consonants, Y is questionable. 

""SNOUT"" has S in position 1, N, O in 3, U, T. This seems good - tests S, N, U, T while keeping O in place.

Letters we still need to test: common ones like I, C, L, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. We should pick letters that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet. 

Good candidates for position 2: I, C, L, D, G, H, M, P
Good candidates for position 5: Y, D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that uses common letters not yet tested. ""SPOIL"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (confirmed)
- P in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (confirmed)
- I in position 4 (new)
- L in position 5 (new)

This tests P, I, L and keeps S and O in place. It also avoids all excluded letters.

So far we know:

- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, N, U, T, P, I, L
- Letters still possible for positions 2 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and a few others)

We need two new letters for positions 2 and 5 that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
The most common remaining consonants are C, D, G, H, M, B, K, F, Y.

Let’s pick a word that uses two of these common letters while keeping S and O fixed.

Candidate words:
- SCOLD – uses C and D (both still possible)
- SHOCK – uses H and C, but C would repeat (not ideal)
- SWORD – uses W and D
- SCOUR – uses C and R, but R is already ruled out
- SMOCK – uses M and C, but C would repeat
- SCOFF – uses C and F, but C would repeat

The simplest choice is SCOLD: S(✓) C _ O L D.  
Positions 2 and 5 are C and D, both still allowed, and no excluded letters are reused.

Therefore, the next guess is SCOLD.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, N, U, T, P, I, L, C, D
- Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: none left (only O is confirmed, and we’ve tested A, E, I, U)

We need two new letters for positions 2 and 5, both from the still-allowed set.  
The most frequent remaining consonants are G, H, K, M, B, F, Y.

Possible combinations:
- S G O M Y → “SGOMY” (invalid, not a word)
- S H O K Y → “SHOKY” (invalid)
- S H O W Y → “SHOWN” (invalid, N is out)
- S H O C K → “SHOCK” (C is out)
- S H O W K → “SHOWK” (invalid)
- S H O W N → “SHOWN” (N is out)
- S H O W Y → “SHOWY” (valid word, uses H, W, Y)

SHOWY uses H, W, Y—none of which have been ruled out.  
It fits the pattern S _ O _ _ and is a valid English word.

Therefore, SHOWY is the best next guess.

We now know:

- Remaining vowels: none (only O is fixed in position 3)

We need two letters for positions 2 and 5 from the still-allowed set.  
The only common consonants left are G, K, M, B, F, V.
