### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

1. Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

   – S is in the word and is now confirmed in position 5.  
   – L and I are in the word but in wrong positions (they cannot be in positions 2 and 3 respectively).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, B.  
- Letters definitely in the word: S (fixed in position 5), L, I.  
- L is not in position 2.  
- I is not in position 3.

Positions left to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4 (position 5 is S).

Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus L and I (which must appear somewhere).

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in S, containing L and I, with:
- L not in position 2.
- I not in position 3.

Let’s try to place L and I in positions 1, 3, 4.

A candidate that fits: CLIPS – but P is already ruled out.

Another: FLICK – but ends in K, not S.

Another: WISPS – ends in PS, but P is ruled out.

Another: NILLS – ends in LS, but L is already used in position 2 (which is disallowed).

Another: DILLS – same issue with L in position 2.

Another: FILMS – ends in MS, M ruled out.

Another: CLINK – ends in K.

Another: SLING – S in position 1 is ruled out.

Another: SLICK – S in position 1 ruled out.

Another: SWILS – ends in S, has S already in position 5, but double S is allowed, and contains W, I, L.

Check positions:
S (position 1) – ruled out (from STUMP feedback). So SWILS is invalid.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4  
And they cannot both be in the same position.

Let’s try:

  Example: L I C K S → LICKS – valid word.

Check constraints:
- L is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).  
- C, K are still allowed.  
- Ends in S (position 5) which is confirmed correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U.

A strong next guess would be ""STUMP"":
- S is in the 1st position (not 4th, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses T, U, M, P which are all still possible letters.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P.
2. The letter S is in the word, but it is NOT in position 1 or 4 (because in AROSE it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and in STUMP it was in position 1 and also marked “-”).

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the eight ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Uses S in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

A good candidate is “BLISS”:
- S appears twice, one of them in position 5 (allowed).
- B, L, I are all still possible letters.
- It is a valid English word.

Let’s try it.

- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U.

A strong next guess would be ""STUMP"":
- S is in the 1st position (not 4th, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses T, U, M, P which are all still possible letters.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P.
2. The letter S is in the word, but it is NOT in position 1 or 4 (because in AROSE it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and in STUMP it was in position 1 and also marked “-”).

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the eight ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Uses S in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

A good candidate is “BLISS”:
- S appears twice, one of them in position 5 (allowed).
- B, L, I are all still possible letters.
- It is a valid English word.

Let’s try it.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: BLISS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) I(-) S(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.

3. BLISS → B(x) L(-) I(-) S(-) S(✓)  
   – S is in the word and is now confirmed in position 5.  
   – L and I are in the word but in wrong positions (they cannot be in positions 2 and 3 respectively).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, B.  
- Letters definitely in the word: S (fixed in position 5), L, I.  
- L is not in position 2.  
- I is not in position 3.

Positions left to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4 (position 5 is S).

Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus L and I (which must appear somewhere).

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in S, containing L and I, with:
- L not in position 2.
- I not in position 3.

Let’s try to place L and I in positions 1, 3, 4.

A candidate that fits: CLIPS – but P is already ruled out.

Another: FLICK – but ends in K, not S.

Another: WISPS – ends in PS, but P is ruled out.

Another: NILLS – ends in LS, but L is already used in position 2 (which is disallowed).

Another: DILLS – same issue with L in position 2.

Another: FILMS – ends in MS, M ruled out.

Another: CLINK – ends in K.

Another: SLING – S in position 1 is ruled out.

Another: SLICK – S in position 1 ruled out.

Another: SWILS – ends in S, has S already in position 5, but double S is allowed, and contains W, I, L.

Check positions:
S (position 1) – ruled out (from STUMP feedback). So SWILS is invalid.

Another: LISPS – ends in PS, P ruled out.

Another: SLITS – ends in TS, T ruled out.

Another: SWILS – again S in position 1 is invalid.

Another: CLIPS – P ruled out.

Another: FLICS – not a valid word.

Another: GLISS – not a valid word.

Another: SLING – S in position 1 ruled out.

Another: SLIPS – P ruled out.

Another: SLITS – T ruled out.

Another: CLASH – ends in H, no S in position 5.

Wait, we need S in position 5, and L and I somewhere in positions 1-4, with L not in 2 and I not in 3.

Let’s list possible positions for L and I:

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4  
And they cannot both be in the same position.

Let’s try:
- L in 1, I in 2: word pattern L I _ _ S  
  Need two more letters from allowed set (C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
  Example: L I C K S → LICKS – valid word.

Check constraints:
- L is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).  
- C, K are still allowed.  
- Ends in S (position 5) which is confirmed correct.

This seems valid.

From the four guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)

3. BLISS → B(x) L(-) I(-) S(-) S(✓)

   – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.

4. LICKS → L(-) I(✓) C(-) K(x) S(✓)  
   – I is confirmed in position 2.  
   – S is confirmed in position 5.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – C is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – K is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, B, K.  
- Letters definitely in the word: S (position 5), I (position 2), L (somewhere), C (somewhere).  
- L is not in position 1 or 2.  
- C is not in position 3.  
- Positions 1, 3, 4 are still open.

Therefore L and C must occupy positions 3 and 4 (since they cannot be in their previously tested positions).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- Position 2 = I  
- Position 5 = S  
- L and C in positions 3 and 4 (order to be determined).  
- Only letters not yet ruled out.

The two possibilities are:
- _ I L C S  
- _ I C L S  

Looking for valid English words:
- “FILMS” – M is ruled out.  
- “NILDS” – not a word.  
- “WILCS” – not a word.  
- “VILCS” – not a word.  
- “DILCS” – not a word.  
- “GILCS” – not a word.  
- “HILCS” – not a word.  
- “YILCS” – not a word.  
- “ZILCS” – not a word.  
- “JILCS” – not a word.  
- “QILCS” – not a word.  
- “NILLS” – ends in S, but L is in position 4 (allowed), and contains N, I, L, L, S.  
  – N is still allowed.  
  – I is in position 2 (correct).  
  – L appears twice: one in position 4 (allowed), and one in position 3 (allowed, since L only cannot be in 1 or 2).  
  – S is in position 5 (correct).  
  – No disallowed letters.  
  – “NILLS” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is NILLS.
