For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (and not A).  
It has four letters already known (R, O, S, E) and one unknown letter.  
The positions we know are wrong:
- R is NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, O, S, E exactly once each (since they all got “-”).
2. Adds one new letter that hasn’t been tried yet.
3. Places R, O, S, E in different positions than before.

A good candidate is “ROSES”:
- It re-uses S, which we know is in the word, but that’s okay because S only appeared once in AROSE and was marked “-” (wrong position), so it could still be elsewhere.
- However, “ROSES” re-uses S in position 4, which was already marked “-” for position 4, so that’s invalid.

Another candidate is “STORE”:
- S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a new letter.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4 before, so okay).
  – T is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 before – oops, same position, so invalid).

Next candidate: “SORES” – same issue as ROSES, S in position 4 again.

Candidate: “ORERS” – but this has two R’s, and we only know one R exists.

- S, P, O, R, E.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4, okay).

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A: not in word
- R, O, S, E: all in word but wrong positions

From Guess 2 (PEROS):
- P: not in word
- E: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 2 again – so definitely wrong)
- R: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 3)
- O: in word but wrong position (was position 3, now position 4)
- S: correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in word: R, O, S, E (and S is fixed at position 5)
- Letters not in word: A, P
- Positions ruled out:
  – E cannot be position 2 or 5 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 2) and cannot be 5 because S is there, so E must be 1 or 3 or 4
  – R cannot be 2 or 3 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 3)
  – O cannot be 3 or 4 (from AROSE: 3, from PEROS: 4)
  – S is fixed at 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (position 5)
2. Contains R, O, E exactly once each
3. Does not contain A or P
4. Respects the position exclusions above

Let’s list possible positions for E, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:     _ _ _ _ S

E: allowed 1,3,4
R: allowed 1,4,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 4
O: allowed 1,2,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 2

Case 1: O in 1
Then word starts with O.
We need E and R in remaining allowed positions (2,3,4) with exclusions:
- E cannot be 2 (from PEROS feedback E was - at 2)
- R cannot be 4 (from PEROS feedback R was - at 3, but 4 is allowed)
Wait, R was - at 3 (PEROS), so R cannot be 3. From AROSE, R was - at 2, so R cannot be 2. So R must be 1 or 4. But 1 is O, so R must be 4.

Then:
O _ _ R S
E must be in 2 or 3, but cannot be 2 (from PEROS), so E must be 3.

Thus: O _ E R S → O E E R S – but E cannot be duplicated (from feedback, each got - once, implying single occurrence). So invalid.

Case 2: O in 2
Then:
_ O _ _ S
E must be 1,3,4 but not 2,5
R must be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5)
Let’s try R in 1:
R O _ _ S
Then E must be 3 or 4
- If E in 3: R O E _ S → need one more letter (not A,P,R,O,S,E) – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: R O E D S – but D is new, but this seems forced. Is R O E D S a word? No.
Try N: R O E N S – not a word.
Try T: R O E T S – not a word.
Try L: R O E L S – not a word.
Try C: R O E C S – not a word.
Try G: R O E G S – not a word.
Try H: R O E H S – not a word.
Try M: R O E M S – not a word.
Try K: R O E K S – not a word.
Try B: R O E B S – not a word.
Try F: R O E F S – not a word.
Try Y: R O E Y S – not a word.
Try Z: R O E Z S – not a word.
None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, R in 4:
_ O _ R S
E must be 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- If E in 1: E O _ R S → need a letter in 3 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: E O D R S – not a word.
Try N: E O N R S – not a word.
Try T: E O T R S – not a word.
Try L: E O L R S – not a word.
Try C: E O C R S – not a word.
Try G: E O G R S – not a word.
Try H: E O H R S – not a word.
Try M: E O M R S – not a word.
Try K: E O K R S – not a word.
Try B: E O B R S – not a word.
Try F: E O F R S – not a word.
Try Y: E O Y R S – not a word.
Try Z: E O Z R S – not a word.
None are valid.

- If E in 3: _ O E R S
But R is in 4, so this would be _ O E R S – but we already have R in 4, so this would be _ O E R S, but then R is in 4, which is allowed. But this is exactly the word we had in Case 1 with O in 1, but now O is in 2. So:
_ O E R S
We need a letter in position 1 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: D O E R S – is this a word? Yes, ""DOERS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- D is new (not in previous guesses)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was - at 3 and 4 before)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, was - at 3 in AROSE – but feedback said - means wrong position, so E cannot be 3? Wait, in AROSE, E was at position 5 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 5. In PEROS, E was at position 2 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can be at 1,3,4. Position 3 is allowed for E.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, was - at 3 in PEROS, so 4 is okay)
- S is at 5 (fixed)
- No A or P
This fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is ""DOERS"".

- O: in word but wrong position (was position 3, now position 4)
- S: correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in word: R, O, S, E (and S is fixed at position 5)
- Letters not in word: A, P
- Positions ruled out:
  – E cannot be position 2 or 5 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 2) and cannot be 5 because S is there, so E must be 1 or 3 or 4
  – R cannot be 2 or 3 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 3)
  – O cannot be 3 or 4 (from AROSE: 3, from PEROS: 4)
  – S is fixed at 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (position 5)
2. Contains R, O, E exactly once each
3. Does not contain A or P
4. Respects the position exclusions above

Let’s list possible positions for E, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:     _ _ _ _ S

E: allowed 1,3,4
R: allowed 1,4,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 4
O: allowed 1,2,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 2

Case 1: O in 1
Then word starts with O.
We need E and R in remaining allowed positions (2,3,4) with exclusions:
- E cannot be 2 (from PEROS feedback E was - at 2)
- R cannot be 4 (from PEROS feedback R was - at 3, but 4 is allowed)
Wait, R was - at 3 (PEROS), so R cannot be 3. From AROSE, R was - at 2, so R cannot be 2. So R must be 1 or 4. But 1 is O, so R must be 4.

Then:
O _ _ R S
E must be in 2 or 3, but cannot be 2 (from PEROS), so E must be 3.

Thus: O _ E R S → O E E R S – but E cannot be duplicated (from feedback, each got - once, implying single occurrence). So invalid.

Case 2: O in 2
Then:
_ O _ _ S
E must be 1,3,4 but not 2,5
R must be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5)
Let’s try R in 1:
R O _ _ S
Then E must be 3 or 4
- If E in 3: R O E _ S → need one more letter (not A,P,R,O,S,E) – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: R O E D S – but D is new, but this seems forced. Is R O E D S a word? No.
Try N: R O E N S – not a word.
Try T: R O E T S – not a word.
Try L: R O E L S – not a word.
Try C: R O E C S – not a word.
Try G: R O E G S – not a word.
Try H: R O E H S – not a word.
Try M: R O E M S – not a word.
Try K: R O E K S – not a word.
Try B: R O E B S – not a word.
Try F: R O E F S – not a word.
Try Y: R O E Y S – not a word.
Try Z: R O E Z S – not a word.
None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, R in 4:
_ O _ R S
E must be 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- If E in 1: E O _ R S → need a letter in 3 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: E O D R S – not a word.
Try N: E O N R S – not a word.
Try T: E O T R S – not a word.
Try L: E O L R S – not a word.
Try C: E O C R S – not a word.
Try G: E O G R S – not a word.
Try H: E O H R S – not a word.
Try M: E O M R S – not a word.
Try K: E O K R S – not a word.
Try B: E O B R S – not a word.
Try F: E O F R S – not a word.
Try Y: E O Y R S – not a word.
Try Z: E O Z R S – not a word.
None are valid.

- If E in 3: _ O E R S
But R is in 4, so this would be _ O E R S – but we already have R in 4, so this would be _ O E R S, but then R is in 4, which is allowed. But this is exactly the word we had in Case 1 with O in 1, but now O is in 2. So:
_ O E R S
We need a letter in position 1 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: D O E R S – is this a word? Yes, ""DOERS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- D is new (not in previous guesses)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was - at 3 and 4 before)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, was - at 3 in AROSE – but feedback said - means wrong position, so E cannot be 3? Wait, in AROSE, E was at position 5 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 5. In PEROS, E was at position 2 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can be at 1,3,4. Position 3 is allowed for E.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, was - at 3 in PEROS, so 4 is okay)
- S is at 5 (fixed)
- No A or P
This fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is ""DOERS"".",Guess 3: DOERS -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) E(-) R(-) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (and not A).  
It has four letters already known (R, O, S, E) and one unknown letter.  
The positions we know are wrong:
- R is NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, O, S, E exactly once each (since they all got “-”).
2. Adds one new letter that hasn’t been tried yet.
3. Places R, O, S, E in different positions than before.

A good candidate is “ROSES”:
- It re-uses S, which we know is in the word, but that’s okay because S only appeared once in AROSE and was marked “-” (wrong position), so it could still be elsewhere.
- However, “ROSES” re-uses S in position 4, which was already marked “-” for position 4, so that’s invalid.

Another candidate is “STORE”:
- S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a new letter.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4 before, so okay).
  – T is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 before – oops, same position, so invalid).

Next candidate: “SORES” – same issue as ROSES, S in position 4 again.

Candidate: “ORERS” – but this has two R’s, and we only know one R exists.

Candidate: “SPORE”
- S, P, O, R, E.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4, okay).
  – P is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 – same position, invalid).

Candidate: “ROPE” – too short.

Candidate: “PEROS”
- P, E, R, O, S.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – P: new.
  – E: now position 2 (was position 5, okay).
  – R: now position 3 (was position 2, okay).
  – O: now position 4 (was position 3, okay).
  – S: now position 5 (was position 4, okay).

This satisfies all constraints: R, O, S, E are all used once each, none are in their previous “-” positions, and P is new.

<|im_end|>

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A: not in word
- R, O, S, E: all in word but wrong positions

From Guess 2 (PEROS):
- P: not in word
- E: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 2 again – so definitely wrong)
- R: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 3)
- O: in word but wrong position (was position 3, now position 4)
- S: correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in word: R, O, S, E (and S is fixed at position 5)
- Letters not in word: A, P
- Positions ruled out:
  – E cannot be position 2 or 5 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 2) and cannot be 5 because S is there, so E must be 1 or 3 or 4
  – R cannot be 2 or 3 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 3)
  – O cannot be 3 or 4 (from AROSE: 3, from PEROS: 4)
  – S is fixed at 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (position 5)
2. Contains R, O, E exactly once each
3. Does not contain A or P
4. Respects the position exclusions above

Let’s list possible positions for E, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:     _ _ _ _ S

E: allowed 1,3,4
R: allowed 1,4,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 4
O: allowed 1,2,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 2

Case 1: O in 1
Then word starts with O.
We need E and R in remaining allowed positions (2,3,4) with exclusions:
- E cannot be 2 (from PEROS feedback E was - at 2)
- R cannot be 4 (from PEROS feedback R was - at 3, but 4 is allowed)
Wait, R was - at 3 (PEROS), so R cannot be 3. From AROSE, R was - at 2, so R cannot be 2. So R must be 1 or 4. But 1 is O, so R must be 4.

Then:
O _ _ R S
E must be in 2 or 3, but cannot be 2 (from PEROS), so E must be 3.

Thus: O _ E R S → O E E R S – but E cannot be duplicated (from feedback, each got - once, implying single occurrence). So invalid.

Case 2: O in 2
Then:
_ O _ _ S
E must be 1,3,4 but not 2,5
R must be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5)
Let’s try R in 1:
R O _ _ S
Then E must be 3 or 4
- If E in 3: R O E _ S → need one more letter (not A,P,R,O,S,E) – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: R O E D S – but D is new, but this seems forced. Is R O E D S a word? No.
Try N: R O E N S – not a word.
Try T: R O E T S – not a word.
Try L: R O E L S – not a word.

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, R in 4:
_ O _ R S
E must be 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- If E in 1: E O _ R S → need a letter in 3 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

None are valid.

- If E in 3: _ O E R S
But R is in 4, so this would be _ O E R S – but we already have R in 4, so this would be _ O E R S, but then R is in 4, which is allowed. But this is exactly the word we had in Case 1 with O in 1, but now O is in 2. So:
_ O E R S
We need a letter in position 1 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: D O E R S – is this a word? Yes, ""DOERS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- D is new (not in previous guesses)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was - at 3 and 4 before)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, was - at 3 in AROSE – but feedback said - means wrong position, so E cannot be 3? Wait, in AROSE, E was at position 5 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 5. In PEROS, E was at position 2 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can be at 1,3,4. Position 3 is allowed for E.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, was - at 3 in PEROS, so 4 is okay)
- S is at 5 (fixed)
- No A or P
This fits all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: R, O, S, E  
Known positions:
- S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2 and confirmed by Guess 3).
- O is in position 2 (✓ from Guess 3).

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, P, D (from the “x” and “-” feedback).

Letters still “somewhere” but whose exact spots are not yet fixed:
- E is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” there).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).

So far we have:
R _ O _ S

The blank at position 4 must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out.  
Letters already used / ruled out: A, P, D, R, O, S, E (E is confirmed in the word but placed).  
Remaining possible consonants include B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching R _ O _ S.  
Likely candidates: R O O _ S (invalid, duplicate O), R I O _ S, R U O _ S, etc.  
The only common English word fitting R _ O _ S is R I O N S (but N is allowed) or R I O D S (but D is ruled out).  
Actually, the correct and common word is R I O N S – but let’s check: R I O N S is valid.

Wait, let’s list all possible:
- R B O _ S → RBO_S – no
- R C O _ S → RCO_S – no
- R F O _ S → RFO_S – no
- R G O _ S → RGO_S – no

- R T O _ S → R T O _ S – no
- R V O _ S – no
- R W O _ S – no
- R Y O _ S – no

Only valid word is R I O N S.

Check constraints:
- R in 1: allowed (was “-” at 2,3,4 before, so 1 is okay)
- I is new, not ruled out
- O in 3: allowed (was “-” at 3 in Guess 1 and 4 in Guess 2, but now it’s in 3 – need to check if 3 was ever ruled out for O)
Wait, let’s re-examine O positions:
- Guess 1 AROSE: O at 3 got “-” → O not at 3
- Guess 2 PEROS: O at 4 got “-” → O not at 4
- Guess 3 DOERS: O at 2 got “✓” → O is at 2
So O is at 2, not 3 or 4. Therefore the pattern is:
R _ O _ S

Thus the word must be R _ O _ S, and the only valid English word is R I O N S.

Therefore, the next guess is RIONS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (and not A).  
It has four letters already known (R, O, S, E) and one unknown letter.  
The positions we know are wrong:
- R is NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, O, S, E exactly once each (since they all got “-”).
2. Adds one new letter that hasn’t been tried yet.
3. Places R, O, S, E in different positions than before.

A good candidate is “ROSES”:
- It re-uses S, which we know is in the word, but that’s okay because S only appeared once in AROSE and was marked “-” (wrong position), so it could still be elsewhere.
- However, “ROSES” re-uses S in position 4, which was already marked “-” for position 4, so that’s invalid.

Another candidate is “STORE”:
- S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a new letter.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4 before, so okay).
  – T is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 before – oops, same position, so invalid).

Next candidate: “SORES” – same issue as ROSES, S in position 4 again.

Candidate: “ORERS” – but this has two R’s, and we only know one R exists.

Candidate: “SPORE”
- S, P, O, R, E.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4, okay).
  – P is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 – same position, invalid).

Candidate: “ROPE” – too short.

Candidate: “PEROS”
- P, E, R, O, S.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – P: new.
  – E: now position 2 (was position 5, okay).
  – R: now position 3 (was position 2, okay).
  – O: now position 4 (was position 3, okay).
  – S: now position 5 (was position 4, okay).

This satisfies all constraints: R, O, S, E are all used once each, none are in their previous “-” positions, and P is new.

Guess 2: PEROS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) O(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A: not in word
- R, O, S, E: all in word but wrong positions

From Guess 2 (PEROS):
- P: not in word
- E: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 2 again – so definitely wrong)
- R: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 3)
- O: in word but wrong position (was position 3, now position 4)
- S: correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in word: R, O, S, E (and S is fixed at position 5)
- Letters not in word: A, P
- Positions ruled out:
  – E cannot be position 2 or 5 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 2) and cannot be 5 because S is there, so E must be 1 or 3 or 4
  – R cannot be 2 or 3 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 3)
  – O cannot be 3 or 4 (from AROSE: 3, from PEROS: 4)
  – S is fixed at 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (position 5)
2. Contains R, O, E exactly once each
3. Does not contain A or P
4. Respects the position exclusions above

Let’s list possible positions for E, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:     _ _ _ _ S

E: allowed 1,3,4
R: allowed 1,4,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 4
O: allowed 1,2,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 2

Case 1: O in 1
Then word starts with O.
We need E and R in remaining allowed positions (2,3,4) with exclusions:
- E cannot be 2 (from PEROS feedback E was - at 2)
- R cannot be 4 (from PEROS feedback R was - at 3, but 4 is allowed)
Wait, R was - at 3 (PEROS), so R cannot be 3. From AROSE, R was - at 2, so R cannot be 2. So R must be 1 or 4. But 1 is O, so R must be 4.

Then:
O _ _ R S
E must be in 2 or 3, but cannot be 2 (from PEROS), so E must be 3.

Thus: O _ E R S → O E E R S – but E cannot be duplicated (from feedback, each got - once, implying single occurrence). So invalid.

Case 2: O in 2
Then:
_ O _ _ S
E must be 1,3,4 but not 2,5
R must be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5)
Let’s try R in 1:
R O _ _ S
Then E must be 3 or 4
- If E in 3: R O E _ S → need one more letter (not A,P,R,O,S,E) – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: R O E D S – but D is new, but this seems forced. Is R O E D S a word? No.
Try N: R O E N S – not a word.
Try T: R O E T S – not a word.
Try L: R O E L S – not a word.
Try C: R O E C S – not a word.
Try G: R O E G S – not a word.
Try H: R O E H S – not a word.
Try M: R O E M S – not a word.
Try K: R O E K S – not a word.
Try B: R O E B S – not a word.
Try F: R O E F S – not a word.
Try Y: R O E Y S – not a word.
Try Z: R O E Z S – not a word.
None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, R in 4:
_ O _ R S
E must be 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- If E in 1: E O _ R S → need a letter in 3 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: E O D R S – not a word.
Try N: E O N R S – not a word.
Try T: E O T R S – not a word.
Try L: E O L R S – not a word.
Try C: E O C R S – not a word.
Try G: E O G R S – not a word.
Try H: E O H R S – not a word.
Try M: E O M R S – not a word.
Try K: E O K R S – not a word.
Try B: E O B R S – not a word.
Try F: E O F R S – not a word.
Try Y: E O Y R S – not a word.
Try Z: E O Z R S – not a word.
None are valid.

- If E in 3: _ O E R S
But R is in 4, so this would be _ O E R S – but we already have R in 4, so this would be _ O E R S, but then R is in 4, which is allowed. But this is exactly the word we had in Case 1 with O in 1, but now O is in 2. So:
_ O E R S
We need a letter in position 1 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: D O E R S – is this a word? Yes, ""DOERS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- D is new (not in previous guesses)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was - at 3 and 4 before)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, was - at 3 in AROSE – but feedback said - means wrong position, so E cannot be 3? Wait, in AROSE, E was at position 5 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 5. In PEROS, E was at position 2 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can be at 1,3,4. Position 3 is allowed for E.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, was - at 3 in PEROS, so 4 is okay)
- S is at 5 (fixed)
- No A or P
This fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is ""DOERS"".

So far we know:
- Exact positions: R _ _ _ S
- Letters in the word: R, O, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, P, D, I, N
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from earlier feedback), so E must be in position 4
- O must then be in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is now taken by E, so O must be in position 3. But feedback says O is NOT in position 3. This is a contradiction.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- From RIONS: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- From earlier feedback:
  - Guess 1 AROSE: O(-) at 3 → O not at 3
  - Guess 2 PEROS: O(-) at 4 → O not at 4
  - Guess 3 DOERS: O(✓) at 2 → O is at 2
  - Guess 4 RIONS: O(-) at 3 → O not at 3 (reconfirms O is at 2)

So O is fixed at position 2.

Current pattern:
R O _ _ S

Letters remaining to place: E (must be in 3 or 4, since 2,5 are taken and it can't be 1)
But from earlier:
- E was ""-"" at 2 (PEROS), 3 (AROSE), 5 (AROSE), and 3 (DOERS) – wait let's clarify:

From all guesses:
- AROSE: E at 5 (-) → E not at 5
- PEROS: E at 2 (-) → E not at 2
- DOERS: E at 3 (-) → E not at 3
- RIONS: E is not played yet in this position

So E cannot be at 2, 3, or 5. The only remaining positions are 1 and 4. But position 1 is R, so E must be at 4.

Thus the word is R O _ E S

The blank at position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out. Letters not in word: A, P, D, I, N. Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching R O _ E S:

Check each:
- ROBES: B is allowed (not ruled out) → valid
- ROMES: M is allowed → valid

From these, the most common and likely is ROBES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (and not A).  
It has four letters already known (R, O, S, E) and one unknown letter.  
The positions we know are wrong:
- R is NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, O, S, E exactly once each (since they all got “-”).
2. Adds one new letter that hasn’t been tried yet.
3. Places R, O, S, E in different positions than before.

A good candidate is “ROSES”:
- It re-uses S, which we know is in the word, but that’s okay because S only appeared once in AROSE and was marked “-” (wrong position), so it could still be elsewhere.
- However, “ROSES” re-uses S in position 4, which was already marked “-” for position 4, so that’s invalid.

Another candidate is “STORE”:
- S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a new letter.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4 before, so okay).
  – T is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 before – oops, same position, so invalid).

Next candidate: “SORES” – same issue as ROSES, S in position 4 again.

Candidate: “ORERS” – but this has two R’s, and we only know one R exists.

Candidate: “SPORE”
- S, P, O, R, E.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – S is now in position 1 (was position 4, okay).
  – P is new.
  – O is now in position 3 (was position 3 – same position, invalid).

Candidate: “ROPE” – too short.

Candidate: “PEROS”
- P, E, R, O, S.
- P is new.
- Positions:
  – P: new.
  – E: now position 2 (was position 5, okay).
  – R: now position 3 (was position 2, okay).
  – O: now position 4 (was position 3, okay).
  – S: now position 5 (was position 4, okay).

This satisfies all constraints: R, O, S, E are all used once each, none are in their previous “-” positions, and P is new.

<|im_end|>

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A: not in word
- R, O, S, E: all in word but wrong positions

From Guess 2 (PEROS):
- P: not in word
- E: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 2 again – so definitely wrong)
- R: in word but wrong position (was position 2, now position 3)
- O: in word but wrong position (was position 3, now position 4)
- S: correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in word: R, O, S, E (and S is fixed at position 5)
- Letters not in word: A, P
- Positions ruled out:
  – E cannot be position 2 or 5 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 2) and cannot be 5 because S is there, so E must be 1 or 3 or 4
  – R cannot be 2 or 3 (from AROSE: 2, from PEROS: 3)
  – O cannot be 3 or 4 (from AROSE: 3, from PEROS: 4)
  – S is fixed at 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (position 5)
2. Contains R, O, E exactly once each
3. Does not contain A or P
4. Respects the position exclusions above

Let’s list possible positions for E, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:     _ _ _ _ S

E: allowed 1,3,4
R: allowed 1,4,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 4
O: allowed 1,2,5 (but 5 is S) → 1 or 2

Case 1: O in 1
Then word starts with O.
We need E and R in remaining allowed positions (2,3,4) with exclusions:
- E cannot be 2 (from PEROS feedback E was - at 2)
- R cannot be 4 (from PEROS feedback R was - at 3, but 4 is allowed)
Wait, R was - at 3 (PEROS), so R cannot be 3. From AROSE, R was - at 2, so R cannot be 2. So R must be 1 or 4. But 1 is O, so R must be 4.

Then:
O _ _ R S
E must be in 2 or 3, but cannot be 2 (from PEROS), so E must be 3.

Thus: O _ E R S → O E E R S – but E cannot be duplicated (from feedback, each got - once, implying single occurrence). So invalid.

Case 2: O in 2
Then:
_ O _ _ S
E must be 1,3,4 but not 2,5
R must be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5)
Let’s try R in 1:
R O _ _ S
Then E must be 3 or 4
- If E in 3: R O E _ S → need one more letter (not A,P,R,O,S,E) – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: R O E D S – but D is new, but this seems forced. Is R O E D S a word? No.
Try N: R O E N S – not a word.
Try T: R O E T S – not a word.
Try L: R O E L S – not a word.
Try C: R O E C S – not a word.
Try G: R O E G S – not a word.
Try H: R O E H S – not a word.
Try M: R O E M S – not a word.
Try K: R O E K S – not a word.
Try B: R O E B S – not a word.
Try F: R O E F S – not a word.
Try Y: R O E Y S – not a word.
Try Z: R O E Z S – not a word.
None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, R in 4:

E must be 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- If E in 1: E O _ R S → need a letter in 3 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: E O D R S – not a word.
Try N: E O N R S – not a word.
Try T: E O T R S – not a word.
Try L: E O L R S – not a word.

None are valid.

- If E in 3: _ O E R S
But R is in 4, so this would be _ O E R S – but we already have R in 4, so this would be _ O E R S, but then R is in 4, which is allowed. But this is exactly the word we had in Case 1 with O in 1, but now O is in 2. So:
_ O E R S
We need a letter in position 1 not A,P,R,O,S,E – possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Pick a consonant not yet used. Let’s try D: D O E R S – is this a word? Yes, ""DOERS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- D is new (not in previous guesses)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was - at 3 and 4 before)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, was - at 3 in AROSE – but feedback said - means wrong position, so E cannot be 3? Wait, in AROSE, E was at position 5 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 5. In PEROS, E was at position 2 and got -, meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can be at 1,3,4. Position 3 is allowed for E.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, was - at 3 in PEROS, so 4 is okay)
- S is at 5 (fixed)
- No A or P
This fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is ""DOERS"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: DOERS -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) E(-) R(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: R, O, S, E  
Known positions:
- S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2 and confirmed by Guess 3).
- O is in position 2 (✓ from Guess 3).

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, P, D (from the “x” and “-” feedback).

Letters still “somewhere” but whose exact spots are not yet fixed:
- E is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” there).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).

So far we have:
R _ O _ S

The blank at position 4 must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out.  
Letters already used / ruled out: A, P, D, R, O, S, E (E is confirmed in the word but placed).  
Remaining possible consonants include B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching R _ O _ S.  
Likely candidates: R O O _ S (invalid, duplicate O), R I O _ S, R U O _ S, etc.  
The only common English word fitting R _ O _ S is R I O N S (but N is allowed) or R I O D S (but D is ruled out).  
Actually, the correct and common word is R I O N S – but let’s check: R I O N S is valid.

Wait, let’s list all possible:
- R B O _ S → RBO_S – no
- R C O _ S → RCO_S – no
- R F O _ S → RFO_S – no
- R G O _ S → RGO_S – no
- R H O _ S → RH O_S – no
- R I O _ S → R I O N S (valid)
- R K O _ S → RKO_S – no
- R L O _ S → RLO_S – no
- R M O _ S → RMO_S – no
- R N O _ S → R N O _ S – no common word
- R T O _ S → R T O _ S – no
- R V O _ S – no
- R W O _ S – no
- R Y O _ S – no

Only valid word is R I O N S.

Check constraints:
- R in 1: allowed (was “-” at 2,3,4 before, so 1 is okay)
- I is new, not ruled out
- O in 3: allowed (was “-” at 3 in Guess 1 and 4 in Guess 2, but now it’s in 3 – need to check if 3 was ever ruled out for O)
Wait, let’s re-examine O positions:
- Guess 1 AROSE: O at 3 got “-” → O not at 3
- Guess 2 PEROS: O at 4 got “-” → O not at 4
- Guess 3 DOERS: O at 2 got “✓” → O is at 2
So O is at 2, not 3 or 4. Therefore the pattern is:
R _ O _ S

Thus the word must be R _ O _ S, and the only valid English word is R I O N S.

Therefore, the next guess is RIONS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: PEROS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) O(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: DOERS -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) E(-) R(-) S(✓)
Guess 4: RIONS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RIONS:

- R(✓) → R is in position 1
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word
- S(✓) → S is in position 5

So far we know:
- Exact positions: R _ _ _ S
- Letters in the word: R, O, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, P, D, I, N
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from earlier feedback), so E must be in position 4
- O must then be in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is now taken by E, so O must be in position 3. But feedback says O is NOT in position 3. This is a contradiction.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- From RIONS: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- From earlier feedback:
  - Guess 1 AROSE: O(-) at 3 → O not at 3
  - Guess 2 PEROS: O(-) at 4 → O not at 4
  - Guess 3 DOERS: O(✓) at 2 → O is at 2
  - Guess 4 RIONS: O(-) at 3 → O not at 3 (reconfirms O is at 2)

So O is fixed at position 2.

Current pattern:
R O _ _ S

Letters remaining to place: E (must be in 3 or 4, since 2,5 are taken and it can't be 1)
But from earlier:
- E was ""-"" at 2 (PEROS), 3 (AROSE), 5 (AROSE), and 3 (DOERS) – wait let's clarify:

From all guesses:
- AROSE: E at 5 (-) → E not at 5
- PEROS: E at 2 (-) → E not at 2
- DOERS: E at 3 (-) → E not at 3
- RIONS: E is not played yet in this position

So E cannot be at 2, 3, or 5. The only remaining positions are 1 and 4. But position 1 is R, so E must be at 4.

Thus the word is R O _ E S

The blank at position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out. Letters not in word: A, P, D, I, N. Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching R O _ E S:
- ROBES
- ROGES (rare)
- ROMES
- ROTES
- ROUTS (but T is allowed)

Check each:
- ROBES: B is allowed (not ruled out) → valid
- ROMES: M is allowed → valid
- ROTES: T is allowed → valid
- ROUTS: U is allowed → valid

From these, the most common and likely is ROBES.

Let's verify:
- R O B E S
- R: position 1 (✓ from RIONS)
- O: position 2 (✓ from DOERS and RIONS)
- B: new letter, not ruled out
- E: position 4 (allowed, not ruled out by previous positions)
- S: position 5 (✓ from earlier)

This fits all constraints.

From Guess 5 (ROBES) we received:
- R(✓) – correct in position 1  
- O(✓) – correct in position 2  
- B(x) – not in the word at all  
- E(✓) – correct in position 4  
- S(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the pattern is now fully determined:  
R O _ E S

The only missing letter is at position 3.  
From earlier feedback, we know the letters in the word are R, O, S, E and B is not in the word.  
Therefore the missing letter must be one of the remaining consonants that have not been ruled out yet.  

Looking back at all guesses and feedback:
- Letters ruled out so far: A, P, D, I, N, B  
- Letters already placed: R, O, E, S  

The only common consonant left that fits in position 3 is “C”, forming the word ROCES. However, ROCES is not a valid English word.  
Checking other possibilities:  
- F → ROFES – invalid  
- G → ROGES – valid (though rare)  
- K → ROKES – invalid  
- L → ROLES – valid  
- M → ROMES – valid  
- T → ROTES – valid  

Among these, “ROLES” is the most common and likely word. Let’s verify:  
- R O L E S  
- L has not been ruled out in any guess.  

Thus, the correct word must be ROLES.
