For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. A popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 different letters

This gives maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, E in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses two new letters to gain more information.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Uses H and U (new letters).
- Places O in position 2 (not 3), S in position 4 (not 4 – but S was already in 4 and marked wrong position, so this is bad). Let me rethink.

Better candidate: “SPOKE”
- S is now in position 1 (was in 4, so valid).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (was in 3, so valid).
- E is missing, but we can test another vowel.

Another candidate: “POSED”
- P and D are new.
- O in 2 (was 3).
- S in 3 (was 4, so valid).
- E in 5 (was 5, so invalid – E was marked not in 5).

Candidate: “SPOON”
- S in 1, P in 2, O in 3 (invalid – O was not in 3).

Candidate: “SHEET”
- S in 1, H in 2, E in 3 (was 5), E in 4, T in 5.
- E appears twice; we don’t know if E appears twice.

Candidate: “OCEAN”

- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 different letters

This gives maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, E in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses two new letters to gain more information.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Uses H and U (new letters).
- Places O in position 2 (not 3), S in position 4 (not 4 – but S was already in 4 and marked wrong position, so this is bad). Let me rethink.

Better candidate: “SPOKE”
- S is now in position 1 (was in 4, so valid).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (was in 3, so valid).
- E is missing, but we can test another vowel.

Another candidate: “POSED”
- P and D are new.
- O in 2 (was 3).
- S in 3 (was 4, so valid).
- E in 5 (was 5, so invalid – E was marked not in 5).

Candidate: “SPOON”
- S in 1, P in 2, O in 3 (invalid – O was not in 3).

Candidate: “SHEET”
- S in 1, H in 2, E in 3 (was 5), E in 4, T in 5.
- E appears twice; we don’t know if E appears twice.

Candidate: “OCEAN”
- A is excluded.

Candidate: “SLOPE”
- S in 1, L in 2, O in 3 (invalid), P in 4, E in 5 (invalid).
- O was not in 3, E was not in 5.

Candidate: “SLOPE” is invalid for O and E positions.

Candidate: “SPOKE”
- S in 1, P in 2, O in 3 (invalid), K in 4, E in 5 (invalid).

Candidate: “SOLVE”
- S in 1, O in 2 (was 3), L in 3, V in 4, E in 5 (invalid).

Candidate: “SOLVE” has E in 5 which is invalid.

Candidate: “SOUND”
- S in 1, O in 2 (was 3), U in 3, N in 4, D in 5.
- No E, but we can test O and S positions.

This seems better: “SOUND” uses S, O, and introduces U, N, D.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in the word but not in position 1 or 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, U, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- S somewhere (positions 3 or 5 are possible since 1 and 4 are excluded for S).
- E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible since 5 is excluded for E).
- No A, R, U, N, D.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place S and E while using new letters to gain information.

Candidate words:
- E is not in position 5, and O is in position 2.
- S can be in 3 or 5.

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _ with S in 3 or 5 and E in 1, 3, or 4.

Example:
- If S is in 3: _ O S _ _
- If S is in 5: _ O _ _ S

Let’s try ""POSE"" plus a letter, but we need 5 letters. ""POSE"" is 4 letters.

""POSES"" has E in 5 (invalid) and S in 5 (valid for S, but E is invalid).

""COBES"" has B and C (new), but E is in 4 (valid), S in 5 (valid), O in 2 (✓). Let’s check:
- C, O, B, E, S.
- No A, R, U, N, D.
- O in 2 (✓).
- S in 5 (valid position).
- E in 4 (valid position).

""COBES"" seems valid. Let’s try it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. A popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 different letters

This gives maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, E in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses two new letters to gain more information.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Uses H and U (new letters).
- Places O in position 2 (not 3), S in position 4 (not 4 – but S was already in 4 and marked wrong position, so this is bad). Let me rethink.

Better candidate: “SPOKE”
- S is now in position 1 (was in 4, so valid).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (was in 3, so valid).
- E is missing, but we can test another vowel.

Another candidate: “POSED”
- P and D are new.
- O in 2 (was 3).
- S in 3 (was 4, so valid).
- E in 5 (was 5, so invalid – E was marked not in 5).

Candidate: “SPOON”
- S in 1, P in 2, O in 3 (invalid – O was not in 3).

Candidate: “SHEET”
- S in 1, H in 2, E in 3 (was 5), E in 4, T in 5.
- E appears twice; we don’t know if E appears twice.

Candidate: “OCEAN”
- A is excluded.

Candidate: “SLOPE”
- S in 1, L in 2, O in 3 (invalid), P in 4, E in 5 (invalid).
- O was not in 3, E was not in 5.

Candidate: “SLOPE” is invalid for O and E positions.

Candidate: “SPOKE”
- S in 1, P in 2, O in 3 (invalid), K in 4, E in 5 (invalid).

Candidate: “SOLVE”
- S in 1, O in 2 (was 3), L in 3, V in 4, E in 5 (invalid).

Candidate: “SOLVE” has E in 5 which is invalid.

Candidate: “SOUND”
- S in 1, O in 2 (was 3), U in 3, N in 4, D in 5.
- No E, but we can test O and S positions.

This seems better: “SOUND” uses S, O, and introduces U, N, D.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in the word but not in position 1 or 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, U, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- S somewhere (positions 3 or 5 are possible since 1 and 4 are excluded for S).
- E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible since 5 is excluded for E).
- No A, R, U, N, D.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place S and E while using new letters to gain information.

Candidate words:
- E is not in position 5, and O is in position 2.
- S can be in 3 or 5.

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _ with S in 3 or 5 and E in 1, 3, or 4.

Example:
- If S is in 3: _ O S _ _
- If S is in 5: _ O _ _ S

Let’s try ""POSE"" plus a letter, but we need 5 letters. ""POSE"" is 4 letters.

""POSES"" has E in 5 (invalid) and S in 5 (valid for S, but E is invalid).

""COBES"" has B and C (new), but E is in 4 (valid), S in 5 (valid), O in 2 (✓). Let’s check:
- C, O, B, E, S.
- No A, R, U, N, D.
- O in 2 (✓).
- S in 5 (valid position).
- E in 4 (valid position).

""COBES"" seems valid. Let’s try it.

Current knowledge:

   - A, R not in word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)

   - C, B are not in the word.
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

So the word is now fully determined:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S
- Positions 1 and 3: must be letters not yet ruled out (not A, R, U, N, D, C, B).

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ E S.

Common words fitting this pattern:
- FOGES (but G is allowed)
- HOMES (H, M allowed)
- LOMES (L, M allowed)
- MOGES (M, G allowed)
- TONES (T, but N is already excluded)
- WOGES (W, G allowed)

So the word is _ O _ E S and the only positions left to fill are 1 and 3 with letters not yet excluded.

Excluded letters: A, R, U, N, D, C, B, H, M, Y, G.

Still allowed: F, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? O ? E S.

Looking through common words:
- F O I E S → “FOIES” is a valid word (plural of foie).
- F O K E S → “FOKES” is not valid.
- L O I E S → “LOIES” is not valid.
- P O K E S → “POKES” is valid.
- T O P E S → “TOPE S” is not valid.
- V O I E S → “VOIES” is not valid.
- W O I E S → “WOIES” is not valid.

The valid candidates are “FOIES” and “POKES”. Between these, “POKES” is more commonly known.

Therefore, the next guess is “POKES”.
