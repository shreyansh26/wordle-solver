### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would contain several of these letters. 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore, the word must be composed entirely of letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}.  

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters, the next best candidates are R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
Aiming for a word that uses several of these common letters, I’ll try “CRONY”: C, R, O, N, Y are all still possible and cover two vowels (O, Y) plus three consonants (C, R, N) that are frequent in English.

So far we know:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- The letter **N** is in the word, but **not** in the 5th position.

D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, B, F, J, Q, Z, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains **N** somewhere other than position 5.
2. Uses only letters from the still-possible set.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

Let's update what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, H, M, I

Letters that ARE in the word:
- U – and it is in the correct position (position 2).
- N – but it is in the wrong position (so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus N and U).

The word pattern so far:
_ U _ _ _

With N somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has U in position 2,
- contains N somewhere else,
- uses only letters from the still-possible set.

Let's look for words fitting _U_N_ or _U__N or _U___N.

Some candidates:
- BUNNY – but Y is ruled out.
- FUNNY – Y ruled out.
- PUNKY – Y ruled out.
- DUNNO – O ruled out.
- GUNKY – Y ruled out.
- PUNGI – I ruled out.
- JUNKY – Y ruled out.
- WUNNY – Y ruled out.
- DUNGH – H ruled out.
- PUNGY – Y ruled out.

Hmm, many common words are blocked by ruled-out letters. Let's try a word with N in position 1: NU___.

Possible: NUMPS (but M and P and S are ruled out or not common).
NUDGE – D and G are allowed, E is ruled out.
NUDGY – Y ruled out.
NUDGE – E ruled out.

Next, N in position 3: _U_N_.

Possible: BUGNY – not a word.
DUNNY – Y ruled out.
FUNNY – Y ruled out.
PUNNY – Y ruled out.

N in position 4: _U__N.

Possible: BUGAN – not a word.
DUGAN – not common.
FUGAN – no.
JUGAN – no.
KUGAN – no.
PUGAN – no.

N in position 5: _U___N.

Possible: BUGYN – no.
DUGYN – no.
FUGYN – no.
JUGYN – no.
KUGYN – no.
PUGYN – no.

Let's try a different approach: use N in position 1 and choose a word with allowed letters.

NUDGE – E ruled out.
NUDGY – Y ruled out.
NUDGE – invalid.

NUDGE is invalid because of E. Let's try NUDDY – Y ruled out.

NUDGE – invalid.

Let's try a word like ""PUNKY"" but Y is out. ""PUNKS"" – S is out.

""JUNKY"" – Y out.

""FUNNY"" – Y out.

""BUGGY"" – G and Y, Y out.

""DUKED"" – E out.

""DUKED"" – E out.

""PUKED"" – E out.

""NUDGE"" – E out.

""NUDGY"" – Y out.

""NUDGE"" – invalid.

Let's try ""PUNGI"" – I is out.

""JUNKY"" – Y out.

""KNUCK"" – C out.

""JUDGE"" – E and D are allowed, but E is out.

""JUDGY"" – Y out.

""JUDGE"" – E out.

""JUGGY"" – Y out.

""KNUCK"" – C out.

""KUDOS"" – S out.

""KUDzu"" – Z allowed, but U is already in position 2.

""KUDzu"" – K, U, D, Z, U – but U is already in position 2 and we need 5 unique positions.

Wait, let's try ""JUDGE"" – but E is out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would contain several of these letters. 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore, the word must be composed entirely of letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}.  

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters, the next best candidates are R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
Aiming for a word that uses several of these common letters, I’ll try “CRONY”: C, R, O, N, Y are all still possible and cover two vowels (O, Y) plus three consonants (C, R, N) that are frequent in English.

So far we know:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- The letter **N** is in the word, but **not** in the 5th position.

That leaves the following still-possible letters (roughly in order of usefulness):
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, B, F, J, Q, Z, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains **N** somewhere other than position 5.
2. Uses only letters from the still-possible set.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters, the best candidates are D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U.

A word like “DUMPY” would use D, U, M, P, Y—but Y is already ruled out.  
“HUMID” uses H, U, M, I, D; none of these have been ruled out.  
“PINKY” uses P, I, N, K, Y—but Y is ruled out.  
“MOUND” uses M, O, U, N, D—but O is ruled out.

A good choice is “HUMID”: it uses N in position 4, and the letters H, U, M, I, D are all still possible.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known **not** to be in the word:  
  S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, H, M, I  

- Letters **confirmed** to be in the word:  
  U (and it is in position 2)  
  N (somewhere other than position 5)  

- Letters still possible:  
  B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
  (plus N and U, but U is already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.  
2. Contains N somewhere other than position 5.  
3. Uses only letters from the still-possible set.

Looking for common words fitting U _ _ _ _ with remaining letters:
- “BUNNY” – B, N, N, Y → Y is ruled out.  
- “PUNKY” – P, U, N, K, Y → Y ruled out.  
- “DUNNY” – D, U, N, N, Y → Y ruled out.  
- “FUNNY” – F, U, N, N, Y → Y ruled out.  
- “GUNKY” – G, U, N, K, Y → Y ruled out.  
- “WUNNY” – W, U, N, N, Y → Y ruled out.  

Next, try words with N in position 3 or 4 and no Y:

- “BUMPY” – M and P are ruled out or not yet confirmed.  
- “PUNKY” – already ruled out.  
- “DUNPY” – not a valid word.  
- “FUNKY” – same issue.  

Try “PUDGY” – G and D are still possible, but N is missing.  

We need N somewhere. Let’s try “PUDNY” – but that’s not a valid English word.  

Another approach: look for 5-letter words with U in position 2 and N in 3 or 4, using remaining letters.

Valid words:
- “PUNGI” – I is ruled out.  
- “PUNKS” – S is ruled out.  
- “PUNNY” – N is allowed, but Y is ruled out.  
- “PUNGE” – E is ruled out.  

Next, try “PUDGY” – no N.  

We need N in position 3 or 4. Let’s try “PUDNY” – invalid.  

Try “PUNKY” – Y ruled out.  

Try “PUDGY” – no N.  

Try “PUNGI” – I ruled out.  

Try “PUNKS” – S ruled out.  

Try “PUNNY” – Y ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would contain several of these letters. 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore, the word must be composed entirely of letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}.  

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters, the next best candidates are R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
Aiming for a word that uses several of these common letters, I’ll try “CRONY”: C, R, O, N, Y are all still possible and cover two vowels (O, Y) plus three consonants (C, R, N) that are frequent in English.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

So far we know:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- The letter **N** is in the word, but **not** in the 5th position.

That leaves the following still-possible letters (roughly in order of usefulness):
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, B, F, J, Q, Z, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains **N** somewhere other than position 5.
2. Uses only letters from the still-possible set.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters, the best candidates are D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U.

A word like “DUMPY” would use D, U, M, P, Y—but Y is already ruled out.  
“HUMID” uses H, U, M, I, D; none of these have been ruled out.  
“PINKY” uses P, I, N, K, Y—but Y is ruled out.  
“MOUND” uses M, O, U, N, D—but O is ruled out.

A good choice is “HUMID”: it uses N in position 4, and the letters H, U, M, I, D are all still possible.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, H, M, I  
Letter that IS in the word: N (and it’s not in position 5)  
Letter that IS in the word: U (and it’s in position 2)  

Still-possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, N, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere other than position 5.
3. Uses only the still-possible letters.

Looking at the remaining letters, the most common ones are D, G, K, P, B, F, V, W.  
Let’s try to form a word with U in position 2 and N in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- N U _ _ _  (N in position 1)
- _ U N _ _  (N in position 3)
- _ U _ N _  (N in position 4)
