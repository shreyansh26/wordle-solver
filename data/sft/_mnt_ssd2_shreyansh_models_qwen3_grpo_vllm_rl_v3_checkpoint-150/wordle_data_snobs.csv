For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with no repeated letters to test more unique letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good letters to try next include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since S must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, let’s try placing S in position 1 or 2 and test new letters.

Possible structure: S _ O _ _ or _ S O _ _

A balanced guess would be ""STONY"":
- S: in position 1 (new position)
- T: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 3
- N: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests S in position 1 and introduces T, N, Y.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 1st letter = S (✓)
   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   - So the word looks like: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y (all x)

4. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

5. N must appear in position 2 or 5 because position 4 is ruled out.

Let’s try placing N in position 2 and test a couple of new consonants in positions 4 and 5. A good candidate is “SNOOK” but O is already used in position 3 and we don’t know about K yet. Another option is “SNOWY” but W and Y are untested and Y is already excluded. “SNOUT” uses T which is excluded. “SNOOD” uses D which is untested. Let’s try “SNOOD” to test N in position 2 and D in position 5 while keeping O in position 3.

Wait, let me double-check: S(✓) _ O N _ – but N can’t be in position 4, so position 2 or 5. If I put N in position 2, then the word is S N O _ _. Let’s test a new letter in position 4 and 5. Good letters to test: L, I, C, U, D. Let’s try “SNOWL” but W is untested and L is new. Or “SNOUT” but T is excluded. “SNODS” repeats S which is already used. “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – but O is already in position 3, and we don’t know if O repeats. Let me avoid double O for now.

Better choice: S N O _ _ with new letters. Let’s try “SNICK” – but C and K are new, I is new. Wait, K is less common. Maybe “SNICK” is fine. Or “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNIPS” is invalid. “SNIDE” uses I, D, E – but E is excluded. “SNIDE” is invalid. “SNUG” is 4 letters. “SNOOK” has K which is okay. Let me try “SNOOK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) O(?) K(?)
But N was marked as “in word but wrong position” in STONY where N was in position 4, so N can’t be in position 2 in SNOOK. That’s allowed, but we want to test N in position 2 or 5. Let me try “SNIPS” – but S repeats. “SNIPS” is invalid. 

Let me try “SNOUT” – but T is excluded. “SNUGS” – G is new, S repeats. “SNICK” – C and K are new, I is new. Let me go with “SNICK”.

But wait, let me think of simpler: S N O _ _. Let’s try “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNOBS” – B is new, S repeats. “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. 

Best seems “SNICK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) C(?) K(?)
This tests N in position 2, C and K in positions 4 and 5, and I in position 3 – but O is already in position 3. Actually “SNICK” is S N I C K – but O must be in position 3. So “SNICK” is invalid because it moves O out of position 3. 

I need to keep O in position 3. So structure: S _ O _ _. N must be in position 2 or 5. 

Option 1: N in position 2: S N O _ _
   - Need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not excluded yet.
   - Good candidates: L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.
   - Let’s try “SNOOK” – but N is in position 2, O is in position 3, K is new, O repeats – but we don’t know about repeats. Let me avoid repeats for now.
   - “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNIPS” – S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. Maybe acceptable.
   - “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – tests N in position 2, D in position 5, and O in position 3.

Option 2: N in position 5: S _ O _ N
   - Fill position 2 and 4 with new letters.
   - “SPOON” – P and N are new, O repeats. But N is in position 5, which is allowed.
   - “SLOAN” – A is excluded.
   - “SMOON” – M and P are new, O repeats.
   - “SPOON” seems okay: S P O O N – tests P in position 2, O repeats, N in position 5.

Between “SNOOD” and “SPOON”, “SPOON” tests P and avoids O repeat, while “SNOOD” tests D. Both are valid, but “SPOON” is more common. Let me go with “SPOON”.

But wait, let me check: S P O O N
- S(✓) position 1
- P new
- O(✓) position 3
- O new position 4
- N(-) from STONY (N was in position 4 then, so N in position 5 is new position)

This seems valid and tests P and N in new positions.

Final choice: SPOON.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with no repeated letters to test more unique letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good letters to try next include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since S must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, let’s try placing S in position 1 or 2 and test new letters.

Possible structure: S _ O _ _ or _ S O _ _

A balanced guess would be ""STONY"":
- S: in position 1 (new position)
- T: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 3
- N: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests S in position 1 and introduces T, N, Y.

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 1st letter = S (✓)
   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   - So the word looks like: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y (all x)

4. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

5. N must appear in position 2 or 5 because position 4 is ruled out.

Let’s try placing N in position 2 and test a couple of new consonants in positions 4 and 5. A good candidate is “SNOOK” but O is already used in position 3 and we don’t know about K yet. Another option is “SNOWY” but W and Y are untested and Y is already excluded. “SNOUT” uses T which is excluded. “SNOOD” uses D which is untested. Let’s try “SNOOD” to test N in position 2 and D in position 5 while keeping O in position 3.

Wait, let me double-check: S(✓) _ O N _ – but N can’t be in position 4, so position 2 or 5. If I put N in position 2, then the word is S N O _ _. Let’s test a new letter in position 4 and 5. Good letters to test: L, I, C, U, D. Let’s try “SNOWL” but W is untested and L is new. Or “SNOUT” but T is excluded. “SNODS” repeats S which is already used. “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – but O is already in position 3, and we don’t know if O repeats. Let me avoid double O for now.

Better choice: S N O _ _ with new letters. Let’s try “SNICK” – but C and K are new, I is new. Wait, K is less common. Maybe “SNICK” is fine. Or “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNIPS” is invalid. “SNIDE” uses I, D, E – but E is excluded. “SNIDE” is invalid. “SNUG” is 4 letters. “SNOOK” has K which is okay. Let me try “SNOOK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) O(?) K(?)
But N was marked as “in word but wrong position” in STONY where N was in position 4, so N can’t be in position 2 in SNOOK. That’s allowed, but we want to test N in position 2 or 5. Let me try “SNIPS” – but S repeats. “SNIPS” is invalid. 

Let me try “SNOUT” – but T is excluded. “SNUGS” – G is new, S repeats. “SNICK” – C and K are new, I is new. Let me go with “SNICK”.

But wait, let me think of simpler: S N O _ _. Let’s try “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNOBS” – B is new, S repeats. “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. 

Best seems “SNICK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) C(?) K(?)
This tests N in position 2, C and K in positions 4 and 5, and I in position 3 – but O is already in position 3. Actually “SNICK” is S N I C K – but O must be in position 3. So “SNICK” is invalid because it moves O out of position 3. 

I need to keep O in position 3. So structure: S _ O _ _. N must be in position 2 or 5. 

Option 1: N in position 2: S N O _ _
   - Need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not excluded yet.
   - Good candidates: L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.
   - Let’s try “SNOOK” – but N is in position 2, O is in position 3, K is new, O repeats – but we don’t know about repeats. Let me avoid repeats for now.
   - “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNIPS” – S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. Maybe acceptable.
   - “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – tests N in position 2, D in position 5, and O in position 3.

Option 2: N in position 5: S _ O _ N
   - Fill position 2 and 4 with new letters.
   - “SPOON” – P and N are new, O repeats. But N is in position 5, which is allowed.
   - “SLOAN” – A is excluded.
   - “SMOON” – M and P are new, O repeats.
   - “SPOON” seems okay: S P O O N – tests P in position 2, O repeats, N in position 5.

Between “SNOOD” and “SPOON”, “SPOON” tests P and avoids O repeat, while “SNOOD” tests D. Both are valid, but “SPOON” is more common. Let me go with “SPOON”.

But wait, let me check: S P O O N
- S(✓) position 1
- P new
- O(✓) position 3
- O new position 4
- N(-) from STONY (N was in position 4 then, so N in position 5 is new position)

This seems valid and tests P and N in new positions.

Final choice: SPOON.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with no repeated letters to test more unique letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good letters to try next include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since S must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, let’s try placing S in position 1 or 2 and test new letters.

Possible structure: S _ O _ _ or _ S O _ _

A balanced guess would be ""STONY"":
- S: in position 1 (new position)
- T: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 3
- N: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests S in position 1 and introduces T, N, Y.

4. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

5. N must appear in position 2 or 5 because position 4 is ruled out.

Let’s try placing N in position 2 and test a couple of new consonants in positions 4 and 5. A good candidate is “SNOOK” but O is already used in position 3 and we don’t know about K yet. Another option is “SNOWY” but W and Y are untested and Y is already excluded. “SNOUT” uses T which is excluded. “SNOOD” uses D which is untested. Let’s try “SNOOD” to test N in position 2 and D in position 5 while keeping O in position 3.

Wait, let me double-check: S(✓) _ O N _ – but N can’t be in position 4, so position 2 or 5. If I put N in position 2, then the word is S N O _ _. Let’s test a new letter in position 4 and 5. Good letters to test: L, I, C, U, D. Let’s try “SNOWL” but W is untested and L is new. Or “SNOUT” but T is excluded. “SNODS” repeats S which is already used. “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – but O is already in position 3, and we don’t know if O repeats. Let me avoid double O for now.

Better choice: S N O _ _ with new letters. Let’s try “SNICK” – but C and K are new, I is new. Wait, K is less common. Maybe “SNICK” is fine. Or “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNIPS” is invalid. “SNIDE” uses I, D, E – but E is excluded. “SNIDE” is invalid. “SNUG” is 4 letters. “SNOOK” has K which is okay. Let me try “SNOOK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) O(?) K(?)
But N was marked as “in word but wrong position” in STONY where N was in position 4, so N can’t be in position 2 in SNOOK. That’s allowed, but we want to test N in position 2 or 5. Let me try “SNIPS” – but S repeats. “SNIPS” is invalid. 

Let me try “SNOUT” – but T is excluded. “SNUGS” – G is new, S repeats. “SNICK” – C and K are new, I is new. Let me go with “SNICK”.

But wait, let me think of simpler: S N O _ _. Let’s try “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNOBS” – B is new, S repeats. “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. 

Best seems “SNICK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) C(?) K(?)
This tests N in position 2, C and K in positions 4 and 5, and I in position 3 – but O is already in position 3. Actually “SNICK” is S N I C K – but O must be in position 3. So “SNICK” is invalid because it moves O out of position 3. 

I need to keep O in position 3. So structure: S _ O _ _. N must be in position 2 or 5. 

Option 1: N in position 2: S N O _ _
   - Need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not excluded yet.
   - Good candidates: L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.
   - Let’s try “SNOOK” – but N is in position 2, O is in position 3, K is new, O repeats – but we don’t know about repeats. Let me avoid repeats for now.
   - “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNIPS” – S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. Maybe acceptable.
   - “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – tests N in position 2, D in position 5, and O in position 3.

Option 2: N in position 5: S _ O _ N
   - Fill position 2 and 4 with new letters.
   - “SPOON” – P and N are new, O repeats. But N is in position 5, which is allowed.
   - “SLOAN” – A is excluded.
   - “SMOON” – M and P are new, O repeats.
   - “SPOON” seems okay: S P O O N – tests P in position 2, O repeats, N in position 5.

Between “SNOOD” and “SPOON”, “SPOON” tests P and avoids O repeat, while “SNOOD” tests D. Both are valid, but “SPOON” is more common. Let me go with “SPOON”.

But wait, let me check: S P O O N
- S(✓) position 1
- P new
- O(✓) position 3
- O new position 4
- N(-) from STONY (N was in position 4 then, so N in position 5 is new position)

This seems valid and tests P and N in new positions.

Final choice: SPOON.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Positional certainties:
   - 1st letter = S (✓)
   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   ⇒ word shape: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from STONY and SPOON feedback)
   - O is in the word but not in position 4 (from SPOON feedback)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y, P (all x)

4. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, K, V, W

5. N must appear in position 2 because positions 4 and 5 are ruled out.

So the word must be: S N O _ _

Now we just need to fill the 4th and 5th positions with letters that:
- have not been ruled out,
- do not repeat any letter already used (S, N, O),
- form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters left: L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, K, V, W

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S N O _ _:

- SNOWS – W is new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNOUT – T is excluded
- SNOKS – K is new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNUGS – G and U are new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNIPS – I and P are new, but P is excluded
- SNICK – C and K are new, I is new – but word must be S N O _ _, so SNICK is invalid (S N I C K)
- SNOWY – Y is excluded
- SNODS – D is new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNUGS – same issue
- SNOWS – same issue

Actually, the only common word that fits S N O _ _ is ""SNOWS"", but S repeats. There's also ""SNOUT"" but T is excluded.

Looking more carefully, there's ""SNOWS"" (invalid due to S repeat), ""SNOUT"" (T excluded), and ""SNOKS"" (S repeats).

Wait, let me think of others:

- SNUGS – G and U are new, but S repeats (invalid)
- SNIPS – P is excluded
- SNICK – invalid structure
- SNOWS – invalid
- SNODS – invalid

Actually, there's ""SNOWS"" which is the only common one, but it repeats S. Let me check if there are others:

- S N O L E – E excluded
- S N O K E – E excluded
- S N O B B – B repeats
- S N O B S – S repeats
- S N O C K – K is new, C is new – but this is ""SNOCK"" which is valid

""SNOCK"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to throw or fling. It uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- N (position 2 ✓, since N must be here)
- O (position 3 ✓)
- C (new letter)
- K (new letter)

This fits all constraints: no excluded letters, no repeats, and all positions correct.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SNOCK"".

Let me check ""SNOWS"" again:
- S N O W S
- S repeats in positions 1 and 5 – but the game allows repeats as long as they're in the word. However, our feedback has never indicated that S repeats. The original feedback said S is in the word but in wrong position (from AROSE), but that doesn't preclude it from appearing again.

But ""SNOWS"" is a valid word. Let's see if we can find another.

Looking at remaining letters: L, I, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, V, W

Possible combinations:
- S N O W S – valid word, but S repeats
- S N O W ? – need 5th letter. W is untested, S is already used. ""SNOWS"" is the only common word.

Alternatively, ""SNOOW"" – but that's not a word.

Another approach: check if any of the remaining letters can form a word with S N O.

Looking at:

Thus, ""SNOWS"" appears to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints, despite the S repeat. The game rules don't forbid repeats unless explicitly ruled out, and our feedback has never indicated that S cannot repeat.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SNOWS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with no repeated letters to test more unique letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good letters to try next include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since S must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, let’s try placing S in position 1 or 2 and test new letters.

Possible structure: S _ O _ _ or _ S O _ _

A balanced guess would be ""STONY"":
- S: in position 1 (new position)
- T: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 3
- N: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests S in position 1 and introduces T, N, Y.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 1st letter = S (✓)
   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   - So the word looks like: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y (all x)

4. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

5. N must appear in position 2 or 5 because position 4 is ruled out.

Let’s try placing N in position 2 and test a couple of new consonants in positions 4 and 5. A good candidate is “SNOOK” but O is already used in position 3 and we don’t know about K yet. Another option is “SNOWY” but W and Y are untested and Y is already excluded. “SNOUT” uses T which is excluded. “SNOOD” uses D which is untested. Let’s try “SNOOD” to test N in position 2 and D in position 5 while keeping O in position 3.

Wait, let me double-check: S(✓) _ O N _ – but N can’t be in position 4, so position 2 or 5. If I put N in position 2, then the word is S N O _ _. Let’s test a new letter in position 4 and 5. Good letters to test: L, I, C, U, D. Let’s try “SNOWL” but W is untested and L is new. Or “SNOUT” but T is excluded. “SNODS” repeats S which is already used. “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – but O is already in position 3, and we don’t know if O repeats. Let me avoid double O for now.

Better choice: S N O _ _ with new letters. Let’s try “SNICK” – but C and K are new, I is new. Wait, K is less common. Maybe “SNICK” is fine. Or “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNIPS” is invalid. “SNIDE” uses I, D, E – but E is excluded. “SNIDE” is invalid. “SNUG” is 4 letters. “SNOOK” has K which is okay. Let me try “SNOOK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) O(?) K(?)
But N was marked as “in word but wrong position” in STONY where N was in position 4, so N can’t be in position 2 in SNOOK. That’s allowed, but we want to test N in position 2 or 5. Let me try “SNIPS” – but S repeats. “SNIPS” is invalid. 

Let me try “SNOUT” – but T is excluded. “SNUGS” – G is new, S repeats. “SNICK” – C and K are new, I is new. Let me go with “SNICK”.

But wait, let me think of simpler: S N O _ _. Let’s try “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. “SNIPS” repeats S. “SNOBS” – B is new, S repeats. “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. 

Best seems “SNICK”:
- S(✓) N(-) O(✓) C(?) K(?)
This tests N in position 2, C and K in positions 4 and 5, and I in position 3 – but O is already in position 3. Actually “SNICK” is S N I C K – but O must be in position 3. So “SNICK” is invalid because it moves O out of position 3. 

I need to keep O in position 3. So structure: S _ O _ _. N must be in position 2 or 5. 

Option 1: N in position 2: S N O _ _
   - Need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not excluded yet.
   - Good candidates: L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.
   - Let’s try “SNOOK” – but N is in position 2, O is in position 3, K is new, O repeats – but we don’t know about repeats. Let me avoid repeats for now.
   - “SNOWS” – W is new, S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNIPS” – S repeats. Invalid.
   - “SNOOD” – D is new, O repeats. Maybe acceptable.
   - “SNOOD” seems okay: S N O O D – tests N in position 2, D in position 5, and O in position 3.

Option 2: N in position 5: S _ O _ N
   - Fill position 2 and 4 with new letters.
   - “SPOON” – P and N are new, O repeats. But N is in position 5, which is allowed.
   - “SLOAN” – A is excluded.
   - “SMOON” – M and P are new, O repeats.
   - “SPOON” seems okay: S P O O N – tests P in position 2, O repeats, N in position 5.

Between “SNOOD” and “SPOON”, “SPOON” tests P and avoids O repeat, while “SNOOD” tests D. Both are valid, but “SPOON” is more common. Let me go with “SPOON”.

But wait, let me check: S P O O N
- S(✓) position 1
- P new
- O(✓) position 3
- O new position 4
- N(-) from STONY (N was in position 4 then, so N in position 5 is new position)

This seems valid and tests P and N in new positions.

Final choice: SPOON.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Positional certainties:
   - 1st letter = S (✓)
   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   ⇒ word shape: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from STONY and SPOON feedback)
   - O is in the word but not in position 4 (from SPOON feedback)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y, P (all x)

4. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, K, V, W

5. N must appear in position 2 because positions 4 and 5 are ruled out.

So the word must be: S N O _ _

Now we just need to fill the 4th and 5th positions with letters that:
- have not been ruled out,
- do not repeat any letter already used (S, N, O),
- form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters left: L, I, C, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, K, V, W

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S N O _ _:

- SNOWS – W is new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNOUT – T is excluded
- SNOKS – K is new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNUGS – G and U are new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNIPS – I and P are new, but P is excluded
- SNICK – C and K are new, I is new – but word must be S N O _ _, so SNICK is invalid (S N I C K)
- SNOWY – Y is excluded
- SNODS – D is new, S repeats (invalid)
- SNUGS – same issue
- SNOWS – same issue

Actually, the only common word that fits S N O _ _ is ""SNOWS"", but S repeats. There's also ""SNOUT"" but T is excluded.

Looking more carefully, there's ""SNOWS"" (invalid due to S repeat), ""SNOUT"" (T excluded), and ""SNOKS"" (S repeats).

Wait, let me think of others:

- SNUGS – G and U are new, but S repeats (invalid)
- SNIPS – P is excluded
- SNICK – invalid structure
- SNOWS – invalid
- SNODS – invalid

Actually, there's ""SNOWS"" which is the only common one, but it repeats S. Let me check if there are others:

- S N O L E – E excluded
- S N O K E – E excluded
- S N O B B – B repeats
- S N O B S – S repeats
- S N O C K – K is new, C is new – but this is ""SNOCK"" which is valid

""SNOCK"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to throw or fling. It uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- N (position 2 ✓, since N must be here)
- O (position 3 ✓)
- C (new letter)
- K (new letter)

This fits all constraints: no excluded letters, no repeats, and all positions correct.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SNOCK"".

   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   ⇒ word shape: S N O _ _

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y, P, C, K (all x)

3. Letters still untested (common ones): L, I, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, V, W

4. The 4th and 5th positions must be filled with letters from the remaining pool, forming a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters left: L, I, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, V, W

Looking for common words that fit S N O _ _:

- SNOWS – S repeats (invalid)
- SNOUT – T excluded
- SNUGS – G, U, S repeats (invalid)
- SNIPS – P excluded
- SNICK – C, K excluded
- SNODS – S repeats (invalid)
- SNOWS – invalid
- SNOBS – B, S repeats (invalid)
- SNOOD – D, S repeats (invalid)
- SNOIL – not a word
- SNOGL – not a word
- SNOUM – not a word
- SNOIL – not a word
- SNOIL – not a word

Actually, the only remaining valid word seems to be ""SNOWS"", but it repeats S. However, we have not ruled out W yet.

Let me check ""SNOWS"" again:
- S N O W S
- S repeats in positions 1 and 5 – but the game allows repeats as long as they're in the word. However, our feedback has never indicated that S repeats. The original feedback said S is in the word but in wrong position (from AROSE), but that doesn't preclude it from appearing again.

But ""SNOWS"" is a valid word. Let's see if we can find another.

Looking at remaining letters: L, I, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, V, W

Possible combinations:
- S N O W S – valid word, but S repeats
- S N O W ? – need 5th letter. W is untested, S is already used. ""SNOWS"" is the only common word.

Alternatively, ""SNOOW"" – but that's not a word.

Another approach: check if any of the remaining letters can form a word with S N O.

Looking at:
- S N O L ? – ""SNOL?"" – nothing
- S N O I ? – ""SNIO?"" – nothing
- S N O U ? – ""SNOU?"" – nothing
- S N O D ? – ""SNOD?"" – nothing
- S N O G ? – ""SNOG?"" – nothing
- S N O H ? – ""SNOH?"" – nothing
- S N O M ? – ""SNOM?"" – nothing
- S N O B ? – ""SNOB?"" – nothing
- S N O F ? – ""SNOF?"" – nothing
- S N O V ? – ""NOV?"" – nothing
- S N O W ? – ""SNOWS"" is the only word

Thus, ""SNOWS"" appears to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints, despite the S repeat. The game rules don't forbid repeats unless explicitly ruled out, and our feedback has never indicated that S cannot repeat.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SNOWS"".

From the feedback so far we know:

1. Positional certainties:
   - 1st letter = S (✓)
   - 2nd letter = N (✓)
   - 3rd letter = O (✓)
   ⇒ word shape: S N O _ _

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, R, E, T, Y, P, C, K, W (all x)

3. The 4th and 5th positions must be filled with letters that have not been ruled out and form a valid 5-letter word.

4. Letters still allowed (not yet excluded):  
   B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, V

5. The 4th letter must be such that the resulting 5-letter word is valid and fits S N O _ _.

Looking at the remaining letters and possible words:

- S N O B ? – “SNORB” is not a word.
- S N O D ? – “SNOD?” – nothing.
- S N O G ? – “SNOG?” – nothing.
- S N O H ? – “SNOH?” – nothing.
- S N O I ? – “SN O I?” – “SNIO?” – nothing.
- S N O L ? – “SNOL?” – nothing.
- S N O M ? – “SNOM?” – nothing.
- S N O U ? – “SNOU?” – nothing.
- S N O V ? – “SN OV?” – nothing.

However, one valid word remains: **SNOUT** (S-N-O-U-T).  
But T has already been excluded (from STONY feedback).  

Another valid word is **SNOOD** (S-N-O-O-D).  
- O repeats, but we have no feedback against it.  
- D has not been excluded.  

Let’s check **SNOOD**:
- Letters: S, N, O, O, D.  
- All letters are allowed (D not excluded).  
- It is a valid English word.

Therefore, the only reasonable remaining guess is **SNOOD**.
