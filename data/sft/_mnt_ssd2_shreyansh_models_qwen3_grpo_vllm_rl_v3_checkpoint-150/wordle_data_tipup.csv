For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word should contain several of these. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.

To maximize new information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters—especially common ones not yet tried.  
Good candidates are words like “UNTIL”, “CHILD”, “MUSIC”, “BLUNT”, etc.  
Among these, “UNTIL” uses the letters U, N, T, I, L, none of which were in AROSE, and covers several high-frequency consonants and a vowel.

Hence, “UNTIL” is a strong second guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, L
- Letters known TO be in the word (but wrong positions): U, T, I
- Letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know the word must contain U, T, and I.  
We also know U is not in position 1, T is not in position 3, and I is not in position 4.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses U, T, and I (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Adds new, high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., C, H, D, M, P, etc.).
3. Places U, T, and I in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.

A good candidate is “CHUIT” (though this isn’t a valid English word). Instead, let’s use “CHUMP”:
- Contains C, H, U, M, P (all new except U, which we know must be present).
- But we already know the word must contain T, so CHUMP is invalid.

Another candidate: “PICTURE” – too long.

Valid 5-letter word: “INPUT” – but N is already ruled out.

Next: “DITCH” – uses D, I, T, C, H. Contains I, T (both confirmed), and introduces D, C, H. Positions: I in 1, T in 3 (but T can’t be in 3), so invalid.

Try “MUSIC” – but S is ruled out.

Next: “HUMPT” – invalid word.

Valid word: “PITHY” – uses P, I, T, H, Y. Contains I and T. Positions: I in 2, T in 3 (invalid for T). 

Valid word: “PITTY” – T in 3 (invalid).

Valid word: “CITIZ” – invalid.

Valid word: “QUICK” – Q, U, I, C, K. Uses U, I, and introduces Q, C, K. Positions: U in 2 (new), I in 3 (new), T is missing – but we know T must be present. So invalid.

Valid word: “BUILT” – B, U, I, L, T. L is ruled out.

Valid word: “TWIXT” – T in 1 and 5, W, X. Uses T twice, but T must be present once. Also X is low frequency.

Valid word: “CUBIT” – C, U, B, I, T. Uses U, I, T. Positions: U in 2, I in 4, T in 5. All new positions for confirmed letters. Introduces C and B.

This seems optimal: C, U, B, I, T. No ruled-out letters, and T is in a new position (5).

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (×):
A, R, O, S, E, N, L, C, B

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (-):
U, I, T

So the secret word must contain U, I, and T exactly once each, and three other letters that have not been tested yet (and are not in the forbidden list).

Un-tested letters (alphabetically):
D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U, I, T
- Uses three new letters from the un-tested set
- Places U, I, T in positions we have not yet ruled out

Positions ruled out so far:
- U cannot be in position 1 (from UNTIL) or position 2 (from CUBIT)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIL) or position 4 (from CUBIT)
- T cannot be in position 3 (from UNTIL) or position 5 (from CUBIT)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces several new high-frequency letters. A good candidate is “DUKIT”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word should contain several of these. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.

To maximize new information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters—especially common ones not yet tried.  
Good candidates are words like “UNTIL”, “CHILD”, “MUSIC”, “BLUNT”, etc.  
Among these, “UNTIL” uses the letters U, N, T, I, L, none of which were in AROSE, and covers several high-frequency consonants and a vowel.

Hence, “UNTIL” is a strong second guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, L
- Letters known TO be in the word (but wrong positions): U, T, I
- Letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know the word must contain U, T, and I.  
We also know U is not in position 1, T is not in position 3, and I is not in position 4.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses U, T, and I (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Adds new, high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., C, H, D, M, P, etc.).
3. Places U, T, and I in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.

A good candidate is “CHUIT” (though this isn’t a valid English word). Instead, let’s use “CHUMP”:
- Contains C, H, U, M, P (all new except U, which we know must be present).
- But we already know the word must contain T, so CHUMP is invalid.

Another candidate: “PICTURE” – too long.

Valid 5-letter word: “INPUT” – but N is already ruled out.

Next: “DITCH” – uses D, I, T, C, H. Contains I, T (both confirmed), and introduces D, C, H. Positions: I in 1, T in 3 (but T can’t be in 3), so invalid.

Try “MUSIC” – but S is ruled out.

Next: “HUMPT” – invalid word.

Valid word: “PITHY” – uses P, I, T, H, Y. Contains I and T. Positions: I in 2, T in 3 (invalid for T). 

Valid word: “PITTY” – T in 3 (invalid).

Valid word: “CITIZ” – invalid.

Valid word: “QUICK” – Q, U, I, C, K. Uses U, I, and introduces Q, C, K. Positions: U in 2 (new), I in 3 (new), T is missing – but we know T must be present. So invalid.

Valid word: “BUILT” – B, U, I, L, T. L is ruled out.

Valid word: “TWIXT” – T in 1 and 5, W, X. Uses T twice, but T must be present once. Also X is low frequency.

Valid word: “CUBIT” – C, U, B, I, T. Uses U, I, T. Positions: U in 2, I in 4, T in 5. All new positions for confirmed letters. Introduces C and B.

This seems optimal: C, U, B, I, T. No ruled-out letters, and T is in a new position (5).

From every guess so far we have:

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, E, N, L, C, B, D, K  
Confirmed letters that must appear: U, I, T (each exactly once)  
Ruled-out positions:
- U: cannot be 1 or 2  
- I: cannot be 4 or 5 (because it was in 4 and 5 and both times got “-”)  
- T: cannot be 3 or 5  

So the word has the form _ _ _ _ _ with:
- U somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5  
- I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3  
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4  

We still need two more letters, both chosen from the un-tested set: {F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
We want a valid English word that uses U, I, T plus two of those letters while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try to place the letters systematically:

Try I in position 1, U in position 3, T in position 4:  
Pattern I _ U T _  
We need a 5-letter word fitting I _ U T _.  
Possible middle letter (position 2) from remaining set: F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Try “INPUT” – but N is forbidden.  
“IGUIT” – invalid.  
“IMPUT” – invalid.  
“IVULT” – invalid.  
“IFUT_” – nothing valid.

Try I in position 2, U in position 3, T in position 1:  
Pattern T I U _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining set.  
“TIU _ _” – no common words.

Try I in position 2, U in position 4, T in position 1:  
Pattern T I _ U _  
“TIU _ _” – again nothing.

Try I in position 1, U in position 4, T in position 2:  
Pattern I T _ U _  
“IT _ U _” – possible.  
Try “ITGNU” – invalid.  
“ITPU_” – nothing.

Try I in position 3, U in position 4, T in position 1:  
Pattern T _ I U _  
“T _ I U _” – possible.  
“TPIU_” – nothing.

Try I in position 3, U in position 5, T in position 1:  
Pattern T _ I _ U  
“T _ I _ U” – possible.  
“TPIRU” – invalid.  
“THIUM” – M is allowed, let’s check: T H I U M  
- Letters: T, H, I, U, M – all allowed  
- Positions:  
  – T in 1 (never ruled out)  
  – H new  
  – I in 3 (never ruled out)  
  – U in 5 (never ruled out)  
  – M new  
- Is “THIUM” a valid English word? Yes, it is the chemical element thulium (though uncommon). Wordle accepts it.

It seems the only valid word fitting the constraints is “THIUM”.  
Let’s double-check:
- Letters: T, H, I, U, M – none forbidden  
- Positions:  
  – T in 1 (allowed)  
  – H new  
  – I in 3 (allowed)  
  – U in 4 (allowed)  
  – M new  
- Word is valid (thulium, accepted by Wordle)

Therefore, the best next guess is “THIUM”.

<guess>THIUM</guess>",THIUM,"From every guess so far we have:

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, E, N, L, C, B, D, K  
Confirmed letters that must appear: U, I, T (each exactly once)  
Ruled-out positions:
- U: cannot be 1 or 2  
- I: cannot be 4 or 5 (because it was in 4 and 5 and both times got “-”)  
- T: cannot be 3 or 5  

So the word has the form _ _ _ _ _ with:
- U somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5  
- I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3  
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4  

We still need two more letters, both chosen from the un-tested set: {F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word should contain several of these. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.

To maximize new information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters—especially common ones not yet tried.  
Good candidates are words like “UNTIL”, “CHILD”, “MUSIC”, “BLUNT”, etc.  
Among these, “UNTIL” uses the letters U, N, T, I, L, none of which were in AROSE, and covers several high-frequency consonants and a vowel.

Hence, “UNTIL” is a strong second guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, L
- Letters known TO be in the word (but wrong positions): U, T, I
- Letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know the word must contain U, T, and I.  
We also know U is not in position 1, T is not in position 3, and I is not in position 4.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses U, T, and I (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Adds new, high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., C, H, D, M, P, etc.).
3. Places U, T, and I in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.

A good candidate is “CHUIT” (though this isn’t a valid English word). Instead, let’s use “CHUMP”:
- Contains C, H, U, M, P (all new except U, which we know must be present).
- But we already know the word must contain T, so CHUMP is invalid.

Another candidate: “PICTURE” – too long.

Valid 5-letter word: “INPUT” – but N is already ruled out.

Next: “DITCH” – uses D, I, T, C, H. Contains I, T (both confirmed), and introduces D, C, H. Positions: I in 1, T in 3 (but T can’t be in 3), so invalid.

Try “MUSIC” – but S is ruled out.

Next: “HUMPT” – invalid word.

Valid word: “PITHY” – uses P, I, T, H, Y. Contains I and T. Positions: I in 2, T in 3 (invalid for T). 

Valid word: “PITTY” – T in 3 (invalid).

Valid word: “CITIZ” – invalid.

Valid word: “QUICK” – Q, U, I, C, K. Uses U, I, and introduces Q, C, K. Positions: U in 2 (new), I in 3 (new), T is missing – but we know T must be present. So invalid.

Valid word: “BUILT” – B, U, I, L, T. L is ruled out.

Valid word: “TWIXT” – T in 1 and 5, W, X. Uses T twice, but T must be present once. Also X is low frequency.

Valid word: “CUBIT” – C, U, B, I, T. Uses U, I, T. Positions: U in 2, I in 4, T in 5. All new positions for confirmed letters. Introduces C and B.

This seems optimal: C, U, B, I, T. No ruled-out letters, and T is in a new position (5).

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (×):
A, R, O, S, E, N, L, C, B

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (-):
U, I, T

So the secret word must contain U, I, and T exactly once each, and three other letters that have not been tested yet (and are not in the forbidden list).

Un-tested letters (alphabetically):
D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U, I, T
- Uses three new letters from the un-tested set
- Places U, I, T in positions we have not yet ruled out

Positions ruled out so far:
- U cannot be in position 1 (from UNTIL) or position 2 (from CUBIT)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIL) or position 4 (from CUBIT)
- T cannot be in position 3 (from UNTIL) or position 5 (from CUBIT)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces several new high-frequency letters. A good candidate is “DUKIT”:
- D, K are new letters
- U, I, T are present
- Positions: D(1), U(2), K(3), I(4), T(5)
  - U is in position 2 (never tested before)
  - I is in position 4 (never tested before)
  - T is in position 5 (never tested before)

All constraints are satisfied.

Confirmed letters that must appear: U, I, T (each exactly once)

- U: cannot be 1 or 2  
- I: cannot be 4 or 5 (because it was in 4 and 5 and both times got “-”)  
- T: cannot be 3 or 5  

So the word has the form _ _ _ _ _ with:
- U somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5  
- I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3  
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4  

We still need two more letters, both chosen from the un-tested set: {F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

It seems the only valid word fitting the constraints is “THIUM”.  
Let’s double-check:
- Letters: T, H, I, U, M – none forbidden  
- Positions:  
  – T in 1 (allowed)  
  – H new  
  – I in 3 (allowed)  
  – U in 4 (allowed)  
  – M new  
- Word is valid (thulium, accepted by Wordle)

Therefore, the best next guess is “THIUM”.

2. Word has U in position 4.
3. Must contain I somewhere, but not in position 3.
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, L, C, B, D, K, H, M.
5. Still need two more letters, chosen from the remaining un-tested set: {F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

The pattern is: T _ _ U _

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting T _ _ U _ with I somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since position 3 is excluded for I).

Possible placements for I:
- Position 2: T I _ U _
- Position 5: T _ _ U I

Let's explore both:

1. T I _ U _:
   - Need two letters from remaining set for positions 3 and 5.
   - Possible combinations: TI F U G, TI G U F, etc., but must form a valid word.
   - ""TIGER"" – E and R forbidden.
   - ""TIFFY"" – F, F, Y allowed, but double F might be acceptable.
   - ""TIGGY"" – G, G allowed, but double G.
   - ""TIPSY"" – S forbidden.
   - ""TIZZY"" – Z, Z allowed, but double Z.

2. T _ _ U I:
   - Need two letters for positions 2 and 3.
   - Possible combinations: T F G U I, T G F U I, etc.
   - ""TFGUI"" – invalid.
   - ""TG FUI"" – invalid.
   - ""T J P U I"" – invalid.
   - ""T P J U I"" – invalid.

The only plausible valid word from the remaining possibilities is ""TIGER"", but E and R are forbidden. Next is ""TIFFY"", which uses allowed letters F and Y, and is a valid word.

Let's check:
- T I F F Y
- Letters: T, I, F, F, Y – none are forbidden.
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), F in 3 and 5 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
- Word is valid.

Another possible word is ""TIZZY"", but it uses Z twice, which is less likely. ""TIFFY"" seems better.

Therefore, the best next guess is ""TIFFY"".
