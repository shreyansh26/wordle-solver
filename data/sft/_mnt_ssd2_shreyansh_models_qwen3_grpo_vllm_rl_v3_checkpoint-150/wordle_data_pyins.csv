### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the two guesses we have:

   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – T, U, M are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M.  
- Letters in the word (but positions unknown): S, P.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- P cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and P.  
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, T, U, M.  
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.  
- Places P somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining common letters to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S and P while using other available letters.  
A good candidate is “SPILL” but it has an L and I which we haven’t tested yet, and P would be in position 5 (forbidden).  
Another candidate is “SHINS” but it has an H and N and repeats S twice; also P is missing.

A valid word that fits: “SPICY” – but it has an C and Y, and P is in position 5 (forbidden).

Next try: “SWISH” – but it has W, I, H and repeats S; also P is missing.

Let’s look for a word with S and P only, and other allowed letters.  
“SPIND” is not a valid English word.  
“SPUNK” has U and K; U is forbidden.  
“SPRAY” has R and Y; R is forbidden.  
“SPICE” has I and C, but E is forbidden.

A valid word: “SHIPS” – S is in position 4 (forbidden), P in position 3.

Another valid word: “SWIPS” – P in position 4, S in position 5.  
Positions: S cannot be 1 or 4, so position 5 is allowed.  
P cannot be 5, so position 4 is allowed.

From the three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)

   – P is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – T, U, M are not in the word.

3. SWIPS → S(-) W(x) I(✓) P(-) S(✓)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).  
   – W is not in the word.  
   – I is in the word and in the correct position 3.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – S is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, W.  
- Letters in the word and in correct positions: I (position 3), S (position 5).  
- Letters in the word but positions unknown: P.  
- P cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
- S is already fixed in position 5, so P must be in position 2 or 3, but position 3 is already I, so P must be in position 2.

Thus the word has the form: _ P I _ S.

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet used (not A, R, O, E, T, U, M, W). Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, Y.

Let’s try to find a valid 5-letter word that fits: _ P I _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BPIKS – not a word.
- CPIKS – not a word.
- DPIKS – not a word.
- FPIKS – not a word.
- GPIKS – not a word.
- HPIKS – not a word.
- KPIKS – not a word.
- LPIKS – not a word.
- NPIKS – not a word.
- VPIKS – not a word.
- YPIKS – not a word.

None of these are valid. Let me think of other words ending in IS but with P in position 2.

Wait, the pattern is _ P I _ S. Let me list possible words:

- BPIKS – no.
- CPIKS – no.
- D... maybe ""DPIKS"" – no.

Actually, let me think of words ending in IS with P in position 2. The only common word is ""SPIKE"" but E is forbidden. ""SPIKY"" – Y is allowed, but K is allowed.

Wait, let me check:
- S P I K Y – positions: S(1) but S cannot be in position 1 (from feedback). So no.

Another word: ""SPIRE"" – E is forbidden.  
""SPIKY"" – S in position 1 is forbidden.  
""SPIRE"" – E forbidden.  
""SPIKY"" – S in 1 forbidden.  
""SPICY"" – C and Y allowed, but P in 5 is forbidden (from feedback P(-) in SWIPS means P not in 5).

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SWIPS feedback:
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1.  
- P(-) means P is in word but not in position 4.  
- I(✓) position 3.  
- S(✓) position 5.  

So the word is: _ _ I _ S, with P somewhere not in 4 or 5, so P must be in position 2. Thus: _ P I _ S.

Now we need letters for positions 1 and 4 from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, Y.

Looking for valid words:  
- BPIKS – no.  
- CPIKS – no.  
- DPIKS – no.  
- FPIKS – no.  
- GPIKS – no.  
- HPIKS – no.  
- KPIKS – no.  
- LPIKS – no.  
- NPIKS – no.  
- VPIKS – no.  
- YPIKS – no.  

Hmm, none of these. Maybe position 4 is another letter. Let me think of actual words.

The word must be _ P I _ S. Possible valid English words:
- ""BPIKS"" – no.  
- ""CPIKS"" – no.  
- ""DPIKS"" – no.  
- ""FPIKS"" – no.  
- ""GPIKS"" – no.  
- ""HPIKS"" – no.  
- ""KPIKS"" – no.  
- ""LPIKS"" – no.  
- ""NPIKS"" – no.  
- ""VPIKS"" – no.  
- ""YPIKS"" – no.  

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""HIPS"" but it's only 4 letters. Need 5.

Actually, let me list 5-letter words ending in IS with P in position 2:
- ""SPIKE"" – E forbidden.  
- ""SPIKY"" – S in 1 forbidden.  
- ""SPIRE"" – E forbidden.  
- ""SPIKS"" – S in 1 and 5, but S in 1 is forbidden.  
- ""SPILL"" – L allowed, but P in 5 is forbidden.  

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word is ""FISTS"" but S in 1 and 5, S in 1 is forbidden.  
""PIKIS"" – P in 1, but P must be in 2.  
""KIPIS"" – K in 1, P in 2, I in 3, S in 5. ""KIPIS"" is a valid word (a type of plant), but let me check letters: K, I, P, I, S. But we have I in position 3, so it would be K P I S. But we need 5 letters: K P I _ S. The word would be K P I K S or K P I L S, etc.

Looking at valid words: ""KIPIS"" is valid but has I in position 4 which is fine. Let me check if K is allowed (yes, not forbidden). So ""KIPIS"" fits: K P I K S. But let me verify:

Positions:
1: K – allowed.  
2: P – allowed (P must be in 2).  
3: I – correct.  
4: K – allowed.  
5: S – correct.  

And no forbidden letters. ""KIPIS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me go with KIPIS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word: ""STUMP""
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- Uses T, U, M, P which are all new letters.
- U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – T, U, M are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M.  
- Letters in the word (but positions unknown): S, P.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- P cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and P.  
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, T, U, M.  
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.  
- Places P somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining common letters to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S and P while using other available letters.  
A good candidate is “SPILL” but it has an L and I which we haven’t tested yet, and P would be in position 5 (forbidden).  
Another candidate is “SHINS” but it has an H and N and repeats S twice; also P is missing.

A valid word that fits: “SPICY” – but it has an C and Y, and P is in position 5 (forbidden).

Next try: “SWISH” – but it has W, I, H and repeats S; also P is missing.

Let’s look for a word with S and P only, and other allowed letters.  
“SPIND” is not a valid English word.  
“SPUNK” has U and K; U is forbidden.  
“SPRAY” has R and Y; R is forbidden.  
“SPICE” has I and C, but E is forbidden.

A valid word: “SHIPS” – S is in position 4 (forbidden), P in position 3.

Another valid word: “SWIPS” – P in position 4, S in position 5.  
Positions: S cannot be 1 or 4, so position 5 is allowed.  
P cannot be 5, so position 4 is allowed.  
Letters used: S, W, I, P – none of the forbidden letters.  
“SWIPS” is a valid English word.

- P(-) means P is in word but not in position 4.  
- I(✓) position 3.  
- S(✓) position 5.  

So the word is: _ _ I _ S, with P somewhere not in 4 or 5, so P must be in position 2. Thus: _ P I _ S.

- ""SPIKE"" – E forbidden.  
- ""SPIKY"" – S in 1 forbidden.  
- ""SPIRE"" – E forbidden.  
- ""SPIKS"" – S in 1 and 5, but S in 1 is forbidden.  
- ""SPILL"" – L allowed, but P in 5 is forbidden.  

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word is ""FISTS"" but S in 1 and 5, S in 1 is forbidden.  
""PIKIS"" – P in 1, but P must be in 2.  
""KIPIS"" – K in 1, P in 2, I in 3, S in 5. ""KIPIS"" is a valid word (a type of plant), but let me check letters: K, I, P, I, S. But we have I in position 3, so it would be K P I S. But we need 5 letters: K P I _ S. The word would be K P I K S or K P I L S, etc.

Looking at valid words: ""KIPIS"" is valid but has I in position 4 which is fine. Let me check if K is allowed (yes, not forbidden). So ""KIPIS"" fits: K P I K S. But let me verify:

Positions:
1: K – allowed.  
2: P – allowed (P must be in 2).  
3: I – correct.  
4: K – allowed.  
5: S – correct.  

And no forbidden letters. ""KIPIS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me go with KIPIS.

Let’s update what we know after the fourth guess.

Previous deductions:
- Word form: _ _ I _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and S).  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, W, K.  
- Letters in the word but whose positions are still unknown: P (must be in position 2 or 4).  
- From SWIPS: P is not in position 4.  
  Therefore P must be in position 2.

So the word is now: _ P I _ S.

We still need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Remaining unused letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, N, V, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word: ""STUMP""
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- Uses T, U, M, P which are all new letters.
- U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – T, U, M are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M.  
- Letters in the word (but positions unknown): S, P.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- P cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and P.  
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, T, U, M.  
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.  
- Places P somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining common letters to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S and P while using other available letters.  
A good candidate is “SPILL” but it has an L and I which we haven’t tested yet, and P would be in position 5 (forbidden).  
Another candidate is “SHINS” but it has an H and N and repeats S twice; also P is missing.

A valid word that fits: “SPICY” – but it has an C and Y, and P is in position 5 (forbidden).

Next try: “SWISH” – but it has W, I, H and repeats S; also P is missing.

Let’s look for a word with S and P only, and other allowed letters.  
“SPIND” is not a valid English word.  
“SPUNK” has U and K; U is forbidden.  
“SPRAY” has R and Y; R is forbidden.  
“SPICE” has I and C, but E is forbidden.

A valid word: “SHIPS” – S is in position 4 (forbidden), P in position 3.

Another valid word: “SWIPS” – P in position 4, S in position 5.  
Positions: S cannot be 1 or 4, so position 5 is allowed.  
P cannot be 5, so position 4 is allowed.  
Letters used: S, W, I, P – none of the forbidden letters.  
“SWIPS” is a valid English word.

Let’s go with SWIPS.

From the three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – T, U, M are not in the word.

3. SWIPS → S(-) W(x) I(✓) P(-) S(✓)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).  
   – W is not in the word.  
   – I is in the word and in the correct position 3.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – S is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, W.  
- Letters in the word and in correct positions: I (position 3), S (position 5).  
- Letters in the word but positions unknown: P.  
- P cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
- S is already fixed in position 5, so P must be in position 2 or 3, but position 3 is already I, so P must be in position 2.

Thus the word has the form: _ P I _ S.

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet used (not A, R, O, E, T, U, M, W). Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, Y.

Let’s try to find a valid 5-letter word that fits: _ P I _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BPIKS – not a word.
- CPIKS – not a word.
- DPIKS – not a word.
- FPIKS – not a word.
- GPIKS – not a word.
- HPIKS – not a word.
- KPIKS – not a word.
- LPIKS – not a word.
- NPIKS – not a word.
- VPIKS – not a word.
- YPIKS – not a word.

None of these are valid. Let me think of other words ending in IS but with P in position 2.

Wait, the pattern is _ P I _ S. Let me list possible words:

- BPIKS – no.
- CPIKS – no.
- D... maybe ""DPIKS"" – no.

Actually, let me think of words ending in IS with P in position 2. The only common word is ""SPIKE"" but E is forbidden. ""SPIKY"" – Y is allowed, but K is allowed.

Wait, let me check:
- S P I K Y – positions: S(1) but S cannot be in position 1 (from feedback). So no.

Another word: ""SPIRE"" – E is forbidden.  
""SPIKY"" – S in position 1 is forbidden.  
""SPIRE"" – E forbidden.  
""SPIKY"" – S in 1 forbidden.  
""SPICY"" – C and Y allowed, but P in 5 is forbidden (from feedback P(-) in SWIPS means P not in 5).

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SWIPS feedback:
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1.  
- P(-) means P is in word but not in position 4.  
- I(✓) position 3.  
- S(✓) position 5.  

So the word is: _ _ I _ S, with P somewhere not in 4 or 5, so P must be in position 2. Thus: _ P I _ S.

Now we need letters for positions 1 and 4 from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, Y.

Looking for valid words:  
- BPIKS – no.  
- CPIKS – no.

Hmm, none of these. Maybe position 4 is another letter. Let me think of actual words.

The word must be _ P I _ S. Possible valid English words:
- ""BPIKS"" – no.  
- ""CPIKS"" – no.  
- ""DPIKS"" – no.  
- ""FPIKS"" – no.  
- ""GPIKS"" – no.  
- ""HPIKS"" – no.  
- ""KPIKS"" – no.  
- ""LPIKS"" – no.  
- ""NPIKS"" – no.  
- ""VPIKS"" – no.  
- ""YPIKS"" – no.  

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""HIPS"" but it's only 4 letters. Need 5.

Actually, let me list 5-letter words ending in IS with P in position 2:
- ""SPIKE"" – E forbidden.  
- ""SPIKY"" – S in 1 forbidden.  
- ""SPIRE"" – E forbidden.  
- ""SPIKS"" – S in 1 and 5, but S in 1 is forbidden.  
- ""SPILL"" – L allowed, but P in 5 is forbidden.  

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word is ""FISTS"" but S in 1 and 5, S in 1 is forbidden.  
""PIKIS"" – P in 1, but P must be in 2.  
""KIPIS"" – K in 1, P in 2, I in 3, S in 5. ""KIPIS"" is a valid word (a type of plant), but let me check letters: K, I, P, I, S. But we have I in position 3, so it would be K P I S. But we need 5 letters: K P I _ S. The word would be K P I K S or K P I L S, etc.

Looking at valid words: ""KIPIS"" is valid but has I in position 4 which is fine. Let me check if K is allowed (yes, not forbidden). So ""KIPIS"" fits: K P I K S. But let me verify:

Positions:
1: K – allowed.  
2: P – allowed (P must be in 2).  
3: I – correct.  
4: K – allowed.  
5: S – correct.  

And no forbidden letters. ""KIPIS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me go with KIPIS.

Let’s update what we know after the fourth guess.

Previous deductions:
- Word form: _ _ I _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed as I and S).  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, W, K.  
- Letters in the word but whose positions are still unknown: P (must be in position 2 or 4).  
- From SWIPS: P is not in position 4.  
  Therefore P must be in position 2.

So the word is now: _ P I _ S.

We still need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Remaining unused letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, N, V, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches: ? P I ? S.

Possible candidates:
- BPIKS – invalid  
- CPIKS – invalid  
- DPIKS – invalid  
- FPIKS – invalid  
- GPIKS – invalid  
- HPIKS – invalid  
- LPIKS – invalid  
- NPIKS – invalid  
- VPIKS – invalid  
- YPIKS – invalid  

None of these are real words.  
Let’s instead list actual English words that fit _ P I _ S:

- SPIKE – E is forbidden.  
- SPIKY – S in position 1 is forbidden.  
- SPICY – C and Y allowed, but P is already in position 2, so word would be S P I C Y.  
  Check letters: S (pos 5 ok), P (pos 2 ok), I (pos 3 ok), C and Y allowed.  
  No forbidden letters.  
  “SPICY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SPICY.

2. Letters that are **in** the word (but positions unknown):

3. Letters that are **not** in the word (from all guesses):

4. Remaining possible letters (unused, not forbidden):

5. From SPICY feedback:
   - S(-)  → S is in word but not in position 1 (already known)
   - P(-)  → P is in word but not in position 2
   - I(✓)  → already fixed
   - C(x)  → C is not in word (already known)
   - Y(-)  → Y is in word but not in position 5 (position 5 is S, so this is irrelevant)

   Therefore:
   - P must be in position 4 (only remaining spot)

   Let me re-examine possible letters for positions 1 and 2:
   Positions 1 and 2 must be from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, N, V, Y.

   - I (pos 3) – correct

   - L I P I S – not a word
   - N I P I S – not a word
   - V I P I S – not a word

   Real word: ""B I P P S"" – not valid.

   Wait, let me think of words with P in position 4 and I in position 3:
   - B I P P S – no
   - D I P P S – no
   - F I P P S – no
   - G I P P S – no
   - H I P P S – no
   - L I P P S – no
   - N I P P S – no
   - V I P P S – no

   Actually, the only valid word I can think of is ""B I P P S"" which is not a word.

   Let me re-examine possible letters for positions 1 and 2:
   Positions 1 and 2 must be from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, N, V, Y.

   Possible combinations:
   - B D I P S – ""BDIPS"" – not a word
   - B F I P S – ""BFIPS"" – not a word
   - B G I P S – ""BGIPS"" – not a word
   - B H I P S – ""BHIPS"" – not a word
   - B L I P S – ""BLIPS"" – this is a valid word!

   Let me check BLIPS:
   - B (pos 1) – allowed
   - L (pos 2) – allowed
   - I (pos 3) – correct
   - P (pos 4) – correct (must be here)
   - S (pos 5) – correct

   No forbidden letters used. This fits perfectly.

   Therefore, the correct word must be BLIPS.",Guess 6: BLIPS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) I(✓) P(-) S(✓),FAIL
