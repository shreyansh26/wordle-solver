### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and has no repeats.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x) → A, R, O are NOT in the secret word.
- S(-), E(-) → S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (positions 4 and 5 respectively).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S and E.
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible candidates: ""STEIN"", ""SHEET"", ""SEEPS"", ""STELE"", ""SENDS"". I'll pick ""STEIN"" as it uses common letters and fits all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but misplaced: S, E

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)
   - T is not in the word.
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - S is misplaced (not in position 1).
   - I and N are misplaced (not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ E _ _
- It contains S and E (E is fixed at position 3).
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, T.
- S is not in position 1, 4 (from AROSE), or 1 (from STEIN). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
- I and N are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively. So I could be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 4), and N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is E), so N could be 1, 2, 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, O, T).

Let's consider S in position 2 or 5.

Case 1: S in position 2 → _ S E _ _
   - Then I and N must be in positions 1, 4, 5 (but not 4 for I, not 5 for N).
   - Possible: I or N in 1, and the other in 5.
   - Examples: I S E N _ or N S E I _
   - But we need valid 5-letter words. ""ISEN_"" doesn't seem valid. ""NSEI_"" doesn't seem valid either.

Case 2: S in position 5 → _ _ E _ S
   - Then I and N must be in positions 1, 2, 4 (not 4 for I, not 5 for N).
   - Possible: I in 1 or 2, N in remaining (not 4), and a letter in the remaining spot.
   - Examples: I _ E N S or _ I E N S or I N E _ S (but S is 5, so last is invalid).
   - ""INENS"" is invalid. ""I V E N S"" is valid? ""IVENS"" is a surname but not common. ""L I E N S"" → ""LIENS"" is valid (plural of lien).
   - ""LIENS"" fits: L I E N S → positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:E, 4:N, 5:S.
     - Contains E at 3 (correct), S at 5 (was at 4 then 1, now 5 - possible), I at 2 (was at 4, now 2 - possible), N at 4 (was at 5, now 4 - possible), and L is new.
