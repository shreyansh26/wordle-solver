2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and provides useful information about the presence of these common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, O, S, E are all x, so they are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A word like ""TAINT"" would use A in position 2 and bring in T, I, N. But ""TAINT"" has two Ts which might not be optimal.
""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all good letters, A in position 2.
""FAINT"" is similar with F.
""MAINT"" is also possible.

I'll go with ""PAINT"" as it uses common letters and positions A in the second slot.

Remaining positions for N: 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 3 or 4).

- HANNY: H A N N Y - but N is in position 3 which is excluded.
- DANA: but needs 5 letters.
- MANNA: M A N N A - N is in position 3 which is excluded.

Wait, let's think again:

Possible words:
- N A _ A _ : N A V A L - but L is excluded.

""N A M A N"" seems valid, but let's check if it's a word - yes, ""naman"" is a word (though rare, it's a name).

But ""N A G A N"" is also possible - but ""nagan"" is a word (a type of rifle).

""N A K A N"" is not a standard word.

""N A M A N"" is more likely.

But let's check another angle: maybe N is in position 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and provides useful information about the presence of these common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, O, S, E are all x, so they are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A word like ""TAINT"" would use A in position 2 and bring in T, I, N. But ""TAINT"" has two Ts which might not be optimal.
""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all good letters, A in position 2.
""FAINT"" is similar with F.
""MAINT"" is also possible.

I'll go with ""PAINT"" as it uses common letters and positions A in the second slot.

- Letters in the word: A (position 2), N (somewhere except position 4)
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2, containing N but not in position 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ _ N
- _ A _ N _
- _ A N _ _
- _ A _ _ _ with N in position 3 or 5

Let's think of words:
- BANAL: uses B, N, L but A is in position 2, N in position 3. This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and provides useful information about the presence of these common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, O, S, E are all x, so they are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A word like ""TAINT"" would use A in position 2 and bring in T, I, N. But ""TAINT"" has two Ts which might not be optimal.
""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T - all good letters, A in position 2.
""FAINT"" is similar with F.
""MAINT"" is also possible.

I'll go with ""PAINT"" as it uses common letters and positions A in the second slot.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P, I, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, T
- Letters in the word: A (position 2), N (somewhere except position 4)
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2, containing N but not in position 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ _ N
- _ A _ N _
- _ A N _ _
- _ A _ _ _ with N in position 3 or 5

Let's think of words:
- BANAL: uses B, N, L but A is in position 2, N in position 3. This seems valid.
- CANAL: C, N, A, L - but A is in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.
- FANCY: F, N, C, Y - but A is in position 2, N in position 3. Valid.
- HANNY: H, N, Y - but A is in position 2, N in position 3. Valid.
- MANGY: M, N, G, Y - A in position 2, N in position 3. Valid.

Among these, ""BANAL"" seems like a good choice as it introduces new letters (B, L) and fits all constraints.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)
   - A is in position 2 (✓).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P, I, T are not in the word.

3. BANAL → B(x) A(✓) N(-) A(✓) L(x)
   - A is in position 2 (✓) and position 4 (✓). So the word has A in positions 2 and 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.
   - B and L are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ A _ A _
- Letters in the word: A (positions 2 and 4), N (somewhere except position 3 or 4).
- Letters not in the word: B, E, L, O, P, R, S, T, I.

Remaining positions for N: 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 3 or 4).

Possible patterns:
- N A _ A _
- _ A _ A N

Let's consider possible words:
- NADIR: N A D I R - but I and R are excluded.
- NAGAS: N A G A S - S is excluded.
- NAMAN: N A M A N - but M is allowed, and N is allowed in position 1.
- HANNY: H A N N Y - but N is in position 3 which is excluded.
- DANA: but needs 5 letters.
- MANNA: M A N N A - N is in position 3 which is excluded.

Wait, let's think again:
The word must be _ A _ A _ with A in positions 2 and 4, and N must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- N A _ A _ : N A V A L - but L is excluded.
- N A _ A _ : N A G A N - but N is in position 5 which is allowed.
- N A _ A _ : N A K A N - but K is allowed, N in position 5.
- N A _ A _ : N A M A N - M is allowed, N in position 5.

""N A M A N"" seems valid, but let's check if it's a word - yes, ""naman"" is a word (though rare, it's a name).

But ""N A G A N"" is also possible - but ""nagan"" is a word (a type of rifle).

""N A K A N"" is not a standard word.

""N A M A N"" is more likely.

But let's check another angle: maybe N is in position 1.
Then the word is N A _ A _ with remaining letters from allowed set (C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y).

Possible words:
- N A V A N - not a word.
- N A C A N - not a word.
- N A G A N - ""nagan"" is a word (rare).
- N A D A N - not a word.
- N A M A N - ""naman"" is a word (name).

Between these, ""N A G A N"" seems the most plausible.

But let's think of other possibilities where N is in position 5:
_ A _ A N with remaining letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
- C A V A N - not a word.
- D A M A N - not a word.
- F A U A N - not a word.
- H A U A N - not a word.
- M A U A N - not a word.
- V A M A N - ""vaman"" is a word (variant of vamana).

But ""N A G A N"" seems more likely.

After considering, ""N A G A N"" is the best next guess.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ A _ (A in positions 2 and 4).
- N must be present but cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- Letters not in the word: B, E, L, O, P, R, S, T, I.

The only remaining positions for N are 1 or 5. Trying N in position 1 gives ""N A G A N"" (a type of rifle), which fits all constraints.

   M is in position 3.  
   N is in the word, not in position 5.

Putting it all together:
- Pattern: N A M A _  
- Position 5 must be N (since N is in the word and not in position 5 per feedback 4, but feedback 5 shows N(-) for position 5, confirming N must be in position 1 and the word ends with a letter that is not N). Wait, let's re-examine:

From feedback 5: N A M A N → N(-) for position 5 means N is NOT in position 5. But earlier feedback 4 says N is not in position 5. So position 5 must be a letter that is not N, but we have no other constraints on it yet. However, the pattern from feedback 5 is N A M A _ and we know N must be in position 1 (from feedback 4), but position 5 must be a letter that is not N. But we have no info on position 5 yet.

Wait, let's re-express the confirmed pattern:
- Position 1: N (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: M (✓)
- Position 4: A (✓)
- Position 5: ?

From feedback 5, the last N got (-), meaning N is not in position 5. So position 5 must be a letter that is not N. From previous exclusions, allowed letters are from the remaining set: C, D, F, H, K, U, V, W, Y (since B, E, G, I, L, O, P, R, S, T are excluded).

The word must be N A M A ?. Looking for a valid 5-letter word starting with N A M A. The only common English word is NAMAN (but that was our guess 5), but it's a name. However, ""NAMAN"" was our guess and we got N(-) for position 5, so it's not valid.

Looking back, perhaps I missed a letter. Let's check if there's another letter that fits. The word must be N A M A ?. From the remaining letters, possible endings are C, D, F, H, K, U, V, W, Y.

Valid English words:
- NAMAN (name) - but we tried it.
- NAMAS (but S is excluded)
- NAMBI (I excluded)
- NAMBY (Y is allowed)

""NAMBY"" is a word (slang for a woman who is easily taken advantage of). Let's check if Y is allowed - yes, Y hasn't been excluded.

So the word must be NAMBY.
