For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, T, E.
- Does contain S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and A in different positions.
2. Avoids L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good letters to try next: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I’ll try a word that shifts S and A to new positions and introduces other common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H
- A is now in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad).
Another candidate: “SANDY”:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RASPY → R(✓) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is in position 1 and is correct.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: R A _ _ _
- Must contain S somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5 are still possible for S, but position 1 is already R, position 2 is A, so S can be 3,4, or 5).
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, P, Y.
- Already used letters: R, A, S.

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s try to find a word that:
- Starts with RA.
- Contains S in position 3,4, or 5.
- Uses other common letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- RASPY (already tried, P,Y excluded)
- RASPS (but P excluded)
- RASPY (already tried)
- RAZES (but Z and E: E excluded)
- RAVES (E excluded)
- RASER (E excluded)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, T, E.
- Does contain S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and A in different positions.
2. Avoids L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good letters to try next: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I’ll try a word that shifts S and A to new positions and introduces other common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H
- A is now in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad).
Another candidate: “SANDY”:
- S, A, N, D, Y
- S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1) – also bad.

Next candidate: “SHARD”:
- S, H, A, R, D
- S is in position 1 – still bad.

Next candidate: “CHASM”:
- C, H, A, S, M
- A is in position 3 – still bad.

Next candidate: “SACRED” – too long.

Next candidate: “RASPY”:
- R, A, S, P, Y
- A is in position 2, S in position 3 – both allowed.
- Uses R, P, Y which are common.

This seems good.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, T, E.
- Does contain S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and A in different positions.
2. Avoids L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good letters to try next: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I’ll try a word that shifts S and A to new positions and introduces other common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H
- A is now in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad).
Another candidate: “SANDY”:
- S, A, N, D, Y
- S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1) – also bad.

Next candidate: “SHARD”:
- S, H, A, R, D
- S is in position 1 – still bad.

Next candidate: “CHASM”:
- C, H, A, S, M
- A is in position 3 – still bad.

Next candidate: “SACRED” – too long.

Next candidate: “RASPY”:
- R, A, S, P, Y
- A is in position 2, S in position 3 – both allowed.
- Uses R, P, Y which are common.

This seems good.

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RASPY → R(✓) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is in position 1 and is correct.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: R A _ _ _
- Must contain S somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5 are still possible for S, but position 1 is already R, position 2 is A, so S can be 3,4, or 5).
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, P, Y.
- Already used letters: R, A, S.

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s try to find a word that:
- Starts with RA.
- Contains S in position 3,4, or 5.
- Uses other common letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- RASPY (already tried, P,Y excluded)
- RASPS (but P excluded)
- RASPY (already tried)
- RAZES (but Z and E: E excluded)
- RAVES (E excluded)
- RASER (E excluded)
- RAGUS (U is allowed, G allowed)
- RAINS (I,N allowed)
- RAINS (S in position 5)
- RAJIS (J,I,S: J allowed, I allowed, S allowed)
- RAMPS (P excluded)
- RAZES (E excluded)
- RAINS (I,N allowed, S in position 5)

RAIN(S) seems good: R A I N S
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- I and N not yet excluded
- Uses common letters

Let’s try RAINS.

Some popular choices include:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n- L is not in the word.\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).\n- T is not in the word.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Does NOT contain L, T, E.\n- Does contain S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.\n\nI want a new guess that:\n1.
