For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Between these, ""AROSE"" might slightly edge out due to the inclusion of O which is extremely common. But ""SLATE"" is also top-tier. 

I think ""AROSE"" is a solid first guess to start narrowing down possibilities.

- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): O, S
- Position constraints:
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 again (from STOIC), so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from STOIC), so S must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 4). However, position 4 is excluded for S, so S must be in 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test other common letters: N, D, L, U, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place O and S in new, still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce several fresh, high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Between NOSPY and DONUS, both are good. NOSPY has S in position 3 (allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). It introduces N, P, Y.

Let’s go with NOSPY.

5. We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1 and 3.

6. A good next guess should test fresh high-frequency letters in those two slots.

   - Position 3: same pool, must be different from position 1

7. Let’s pick B for position 1 and M for position 3 → B O M _ S  
   The missing letter in position 4 must also be from the allowed set.  
   Let’s test D: B O M D S → “BOMDS” is not a valid English word.

   Try L for position 4: B O M L S → “BOMLS” invalid.

   Swap: H for position 1 and L for position 3 → H O L _ S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Between these, ""AROSE"" might slightly edge out due to the inclusion of O which is extremely common. But ""SLATE"" is also top-tier. 

I think ""AROSE"" is a solid first guess to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S
2. Does not contain A, R, or E
3. Has O not in position 3 and S not in position 4

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want to test new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let me try ""STOIC"":
- S: position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position is OK)
- T: new letter
- O: position 2 (was in position 3 before, so new position is OK)
- I: new letter
- C: new letter

This tests S in position 1, O in position 2, and introduces T, I, C.

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)

What we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): O, S
- Position constraints:
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 again (from STOIC), so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from STOIC), so S must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 4). However, position 4 is excluded for S, so S must be in 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test other common letters: N, D, L, U, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place O and S in new, still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce several fresh, high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Candidate: SOUND
- S in position 1 → but S cannot be in position 1 (from STOIC feedback). So SOUND is invalid.

Candidate: SONIC → contains C (already ruled out).

Candidate: SPOON → contains P and N, but also P and N are new. However, O is repeated, and we don’t know if O can appear twice.

Candidate: SNOOD → S in 1 (invalid), plus D is new.

Candidate: NOSPY → S in 3, O in 2. Letters N, P, Y are new. No disallowed letters. This looks valid.

Another candidate: DONUS → S in 5, O in 2, introduces D, U, N. Also valid.

Between NOSPY and DONUS, both are good. NOSPY has S in position 3 (allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). It introduces N, P, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Between these, ""AROSE"" might slightly edge out due to the inclusion of O which is extremely common. But ""SLATE"" is also top-tier. 

I think ""AROSE"" is a solid first guess to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S
2. Does not contain A, R, or E
3. Has O not in position 3 and S not in position 4

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want to test new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let me try ""STOIC"":
- S: position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position is OK)
- T: new letter
- O: position 2 (was in position 3 before, so new position is OK)
- I: new letter
- C: new letter

This tests S in position 1, O in position 2, and introduces T, I, C.

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)

What we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): O, S
- Position constraints:
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 again (from STOIC), so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from STOIC), so S must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 4). However, position 4 is excluded for S, so S must be in 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test other common letters: N, D, L, U, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place O and S in new, still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce several fresh, high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Candidate: SOUND
- S in position 1 → but S cannot be in position 1 (from STOIC feedback). So SOUND is invalid.

Candidate: SONIC → contains C (already ruled out).

Candidate: SPOON → contains P and N, but also P and N are new. However, O is repeated, and we don’t know if O can appear twice.

Candidate: SNOOD → S in 1 (invalid), plus D is new.

Candidate: NOSPY → S in 3, O in 2. Letters N, P, Y are new. No disallowed letters. This looks valid.

Another candidate: DONUS → S in 5, O in 2, introduces D, U, N. Also valid.

Between NOSPY and DONUS, both are good. NOSPY has S in position 3 (allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). It introduces N, P, Y.

Let’s go with NOSPY.

Let’s update what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
   A, R, E, T, I, C, N, P, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   O (now fixed in position 2), S (still somewhere, but not in positions 1, 3, 4)  
   → S must be in position 5 (only remaining spot).

3. So far the word looks like: _ O _ _ S

4. Remaining unused common letters:  
   B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z

5. We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1 and 3.

6. A good next guess should test fresh high-frequency letters in those two slots.

   Candidate:  
   - Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M  
   - Position 3: same pool, must be different from position 1

7. Let’s pick B for position 1 and M for position 3 → B O M _ S  
   The missing letter in position 4 must also be from the allowed set.  
   Let’s test D: B O M D S → “BOMDS” is not a valid English word.

   Try L for position 4: B O M L S → “BOMLS” invalid.

   Swap: H for position 1 and L for position 3 → H O L _ S  
   Try D for position 4: H O L D S → “HOLDS” is a valid English word.

   Check constraints:  
   - Contains O in position 2 (✓)  
   - Contains S in position 5 (✓)  
   - No disallowed letters (A, R, E, T, I, C, N, P, Y)  
   - All letters are unique.

   Therefore “HOLDS” satisfies every known constraint.

From the feedback on BOGUS:
- G and U are in the word but in the wrong positions (they cannot be in positions 3 and 4 respectively).

So:
- G must be in position 1 or 4
- U must be in position 1 or 3

We need to place G and U in the remaining three slots (1, 3, 4) while respecting these constraints and using only the allowed letters.

Possible placements:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need a letter for position 4 from remaining allowed set (F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)
   - GOUFS, GOUKS, etc. – check if any are valid words
2. G in 1, U in 4 → G O _ U S → need a letter for position 3

Looking for valid English words fitting _ O _ _ S with letters from {F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z} and considering the constraints:

The only common word that fits is ""FOGUS"" but F is allowed and positions:
- F in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (locked)
- G in 3 (but G cannot be in 3 from BOGUS feedback where G was in 3 and marked -)
Wait, BOGUS had G in 3 and it was marked -, meaning G is in word but not in 3. So G can be in 1 or 4.

Similarly U was in 4 and marked -, so U can be in 1 or 3.

Let's try:
- G in 1, U in 3: G O U _ S → need position 4 from allowed letters (F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)
   - GOUFS – valid word
   - Check letters: G, O, U, F, S – all allowed and positions respect constraints

Therefore, GOUFS is a valid next guess.

Similarly U was in 4 and marked -, so U can be in 1 or 3.

Let's try:
- G in 1, U in 3: G O U _ S → need position 4 from allowed letters (F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)
   - GOUFS – valid word
   - Check letters: G, O, U, F, S – all allowed and positions respect constraints
   - G is in 1 (allowed), U is in 3 (allowed), no disallowed letters

Therefore, GOUFS is a valid next guess.",Guess 6: GOUFS -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) U(✓) F(x) S(✓),FAIL
