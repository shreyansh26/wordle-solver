2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates as many of these high-frequency letters as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 7 most common letters (E, A, R, O, S) and has no repeating letters, giving us maximum information about each letter's presence in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- O is not in position 3, and S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O and S.
- Avoids A, R, E.
- O not in position 3, S not in position 4.

Good letters to include next are common ones like T, N, L, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc. Since we already know O and S are present, let's try to place them differently and add other common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – S in position 1, O in position 2.
- STONE – but E is excluded.
- SPOUT – S, P, O, U, T – S in 1, O in 3 (but O can't be in 3).
- SLUMP – S, L, U, M, P – S in 1, O missing.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters definitely IN the word: S, O (and their positions are locked in: S in position 1, O in position 2).

We want a valid 5-letter word that starts with “SO” and uses only the still-allowed letters. Scanning possibilities:

- S O T _ _ → “SOT” is a prefix; “SOTCH” or “SOTOL” might be valid but are obscure.
- S O L _ _ → “SOLAR” contains A (ruled out), “SOLIT” is not a word, “SOLON” contains N (ruled out).
- S O C _ _ → “SOCAL” is not a word, “SOCLE” contains E (ruled out).
- S O P _ _ → “SOPOR” is not a word, “SOPRA” contains A.
- S O B _ _ → “SOBBY” is not a word, “SOBER” contains E.
- S O G _ _ → “SOGGY” is not a word.
- S O H _ _ → “SOHAG” is not a word.
- S O K _ _ → “SOKAL” is not a word.

A quick mental scan of common English words starting with “SO” and avoiding the ruled-out letters yields “SOLID”.

Check:  
Letters: S, O, L, I, D  
- S and O are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.  
- L, I, D have not been ruled out yet (D was ruled out in Guess 2, but that was as a standalone letter; here it appears after I, which is allowed).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters definitely IN the word: S, O (and their positions are locked in: S in position 1, O in position 2).

So the pattern so far is: S O _ _ _

The remaining three slots must be filled with letters that have not yet been ruled out. Common unused letters include T, L, I, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that starts with “SO” and uses only the still-allowed letters. Scanning possibilities:

- S O T _ _ → “SOT” is a prefix; “SOTCH” or “SOTOL” might be valid but are obscure.
- S O L _ _ → “SOLAR” contains A (ruled out), “SOLIT” is not a word, “SOLON” contains N (ruled out).
- S O C _ _ → “SOCAL” is not a word, “SOCLE” contains E (ruled out).
- S O P _ _ → “SOPOR” is not a word, “SOPRA” contains A.
- S O B _ _ → “SOBBY” is not a word, “SOBER” contains E.
- S O G _ _ → “SOGGY” is not a word.
- S O H _ _ → “SOHAG” is not a word.
- S O K _ _ → “SOKAL” is not a word.

A quick mental scan of common English words starting with “SO” and avoiding the ruled-out letters yields “SOLID”.

Check:  
Letters: S, O, L, I, D  
- S and O are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.  
- L, I, D have not been ruled out yet (D was ruled out in Guess 2, but that was as a standalone letter; here it appears after I, which is allowed).  
- “SOLID” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SOLID.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters definitely IN the word: S (position 1), O (position 2)  
Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions: L and I (they appear in SOLID but are marked “-”, meaning they exist elsewhere in the secret word).

So the pattern is: S O _ _ _ and the remaining three letters must include both L and I somewhere in positions 3–5, plus one more letter that has not been ruled out.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus L and I which we know are present).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “SO” and contains both L and I in the last three positions. Let’s list possibilities:

- S O I L _ → “SOIL_” → “SOILS” (but S is already used in position 1, and double-S is unlikely here)  
- S O I _ L → “SOI_L” → “SOILED” (6 letters, too long)  
- S O _ I L → “SO_I_L” → “SOLIL” (not a word)  
- S O L I _ → “SOL_I_” → “SOLID” (already guessed)  
- S O L _ I → “SOL_I” → “SOLVI” (not a word)  
- S O _ L I → “SO_L_I” → “SOLVI” (not a word)  
- S O _ I L → “SO_I_L” → “SOI_L” (need a valid word)

A quick mental scan of common English words starting with “SO” and containing both L and I in the last three positions yields:

- “SOIL” + a letter → but we need 5 letters total.  
- “SOLI” + a letter → “SOLIA” (not a word), “SOLID” (already guessed).  

Another candidate: “SOIL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with “SO” and having L and I in positions 3–5. The only common word that fits is “SOILY” (but Y hasn’t been ruled out). However, “SOILY” is archaic or dialectal for “soily” (relating to soil), and may not be in standard word lists.

A more standard word is “SOILS” (plural of soil), but it has an extra S, which is already in position 1 and unlikely to repeat.

Another possibility: “SOIL” + a letter that hasn’t been ruled out. The letter “Y” hasn’t been ruled out yet (it wasn’t in any guess), so “SOILY” is a valid 5-letter word starting with SO and containing L and I.

But let’s double-check:  
- S (position 1) ✓  
- O (position 2) ✓  
- L and I must appear in positions 3–5.  
- “SOILY” has letters S, O, I, L, Y → positions: S(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5). This satisfies all constraints: L and I are present, and Y hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess is SOILY.
