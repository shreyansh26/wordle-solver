- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.

So we know:

- It definitely does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

A good next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels while placing O in a different spot. The word “POINT” comes to mind because:
- It places O in position 2 (different from the previous position 3).
- It introduces P, I, N, T – all common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

From the new feedback on DONUT:
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = U
- The word contains N and T, but:
  – N ≠ position 3
  – T ≠ position 5
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, D

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- U in position 4
- N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 allowed, but not 4)
- T somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 allowed, but not 5)
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s list possible positions for N and T:
N can be in 1, 3, or 5 (but 2 is O, 4 is U)
T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 2 is O, 4 is U) → T can be in 1 or 3.

Case 1: T in position 1
Then N must be in 3 or 5.
Word structure: T O _ U _
If N is in 3: T O N U _
Last letter must be new and allowed (not forbidden). Let’s try B → TONUB (but not a word).
Try M → TONUM (not a word).
Try L → TONUL (not a word).
Try K → TONUK (not a word).
No valid words here.

Case 2: T in position 3
Then N can be in 1 or 5.
Word structure: _ O T U _
If N is in 1: N O T U _
Last letter must be new and allowed. Try B → NOTUB (invalid).
Try L → NOTUL (invalid).
Try K → NOTUK (invalid).
No valid words.

If N is in 5: _ O T U N
First letter must be new and allowed. Try B → BOTUN (invalid).
Try C → CO TUN (invalid).
Try F → FOTUN (invalid).
Try G → GOTUN (invalid).
Try H → H O T U N → HOTUN (invalid).
Try L → L O T U N → LOTUN (invalid).
Try M → M O T U N → MOTUN (invalid).
Try V → V O T U N → VOTUN (invalid).
None of these are valid English words.

Hmm, maybe we missed something. Let me re-examine possible letters and positions.

Alternative approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2 and U in position 4, containing N and T, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible structure: _ O _ U _
Letters allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding forbidden).

We need N and T in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 2 and 4 are fixed).

Possible combinations:
- N in 1, T in 3: N O T U _ → need last letter. Try N O T U B (invalid), N O T U M (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 1, T in 5: N O _ U T → need letter in 3. Try N O B U T (invalid), N O C U T (invalid), N O G U T (invalid), N O L U T (invalid), N O M U T (invalid), N O V U T (invalid). No valid word.
- N in 3, T in 1: T O N U _ → last letter. Try T O N U B (invalid), T O N U M (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 3, T in 5: _ O N U T → first letter. Try B O N U T (invalid), C O N U T (invalid), F O N U T (invalid), G O N U T (invalid), H O N U T (invalid), L O N U T (invalid), M O N U T (invalid), V O N U T (invalid). No valid word.
- N in 5, T in 1: T O _ U N → middle letter. Try T O B U N (invalid), T O C U N (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 5, T in 3: _ O T U N → first letter. Try B O T U N (invalid), C O T U N (invalid), F O T U N (invalid), G O T U N (invalid), H O T U N (invalid), L O T U N (invalid), M O T U N (invalid), V O T U N (invalid).

Wait, let me think of actual valid English words that fit:
- Words with O in 2 and U in 4: ""COBUX"" (invalid), ""COGUM"" (invalid), ""COYUN"" (invalid), ""CONUT"" (invalid), ""COTUN"" (invalid), ""FOGUM"" (invalid), ""GONUT"" (invalid), ""HONUT"" (invalid), ""MONUT"" (invalid), ""TONUT"" (invalid).

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a letter or position. Let me re-examine the constraints carefully.

Actually, looking back, the word must have:
- O in position 2
- U in position 4
- Contain N and T (but N not in 3, T not in 5)
- Avoid A, R, S, E, P, I, D

Valid word: ""CONUT"" – but this has N in 3 which is forbidden.
""TONIC"" – contains I which is forbidden.
""NOVUM"" – has M and U, but N in 1, T in 3 (but T must be in 1 or 3, N in 1 or 5). Wait, ""NOVUM"" has U in 4, O in 2, N in 1, T in 3, M in 5. But T is in 3 which is allowed (T not in 5), N in 1 is allowed (N not in 3). This seems valid.

Check letters:
- N in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (correct)
- T in 3 (allowed, since T not in 5)
- U in 4 (correct)
- M in 5 (new, allowed)
Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, D – none present.

""NOVUM"" is a valid English word (Latin for ""new""), but is it in standard English dictionaries? It might be considered obscure. However, it fits all constraints.

Alternative: ""CONUT"" – but N is in 3 which is forbidden.
""TONUT"" – invalid word.
""MONUT"" – invalid.
""FOGUM"" – invalid.

""NOVUM"" seems to be the only valid option fitting all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- It definitely does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

A good next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels while placing O in a different spot. The word “POINT” comes to mind because:
- It places O in position 2 (different from the previous position 3).
- It introduces P, I, N, T – all common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

Let’s go with POINT.

From the new feedback on POINT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is definitely O.
- The word contains N and T, but they are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- N somewhere other than position 4.
- T somewhere other than position 5.
- No A, R, S, E, P, I.

Let’s look for a word that fits these constraints. One candidate is “CONNO” but that repeats O unnecessarily and has no T. Another candidate is “TONIC” but it contains I which we know is not in the word. “DONUT” has U and D which are new letters to test, and fits:
- O in position 2.
- N not in position 4 (it’s in position 3).
- T not in position 5 (it’s in position 1).
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s try DONUT.

Guess 3: DONUT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(-) U(✓) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DONUT:
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = U
- The word contains N and T, but:
  – N ≠ position 3
  – T ≠ position 5
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, D

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- U in position 4
- N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 allowed, but not 4)
- T somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 allowed, but not 5)
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s list possible positions for N and T:
N can be in 1, 3, or 5 (but 2 is O, 4 is U)
T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 2 is O, 4 is U) → T can be in 1 or 3.

Case 1: T in position 1
Then N must be in 3 or 5.
Word structure: T O _ U _
If N is in 3: T O N U _
Last letter must be new and allowed (not forbidden). Let’s try B → TONUB (but not a word).
Try M → TONUM (not a word).
Try L → TONUL (not a word).
Try K → TONUK (not a word).
No valid words here.

Case 2: T in position 3
Then N can be in 1 or 5.
Word structure: _ O T U _
If N is in 1: N O T U _
Last letter must be new and allowed. Try B → NOTUB (invalid).
Try L → NOTUL (invalid).
Try K → NOTUK (invalid).
No valid words.

If N is in 5: _ O T U N
First letter must be new and allowed. Try B → BOTUN (invalid).
Try C → CO TUN (invalid).
Try F → FOTUN (invalid).
Try G → GOTUN (invalid).
Try H → H O T U N → HOTUN (invalid).
Try L → L O T U N → LOTUN (invalid).
Try M → M O T U N → MOTUN (invalid).
Try V → V O T U N → VOTUN (invalid).
None of these are valid English words.

Hmm, maybe we missed something. Let me re-examine possible letters and positions.

Alternative approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2 and U in position 4, containing N and T, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible structure: _ O _ U _
Letters allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding forbidden).

We need N and T in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 2 and 4 are fixed).

Possible combinations:
- N in 1, T in 3: N O T U _ → need last letter. Try N O T U B (invalid), N O T U M (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 1, T in 5: N O _ U T → need letter in 3. Try N O B U T (invalid), N O C U T (invalid), N O G U T (invalid), N O L U T (invalid), N O M U T (invalid), N O V U T (invalid). No valid word.
- N in 3, T in 1: T O N U _ → last letter. Try T O N U B (invalid), T O N U M (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 3, T in 5: _ O N U T → first letter. Try B O N U T (invalid), C O N U T (invalid), F O N U T (invalid), G O N U T (invalid), H O N U T (invalid), L O N U T (invalid), M O N U T (invalid), V O N U T (invalid). No valid word.
- N in 5, T in 1: T O _ U N → middle letter. Try T O B U N (invalid), T O C U N (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 5, T in 3: _ O T U N → first letter. Try B O T U N (invalid), C O T U N (invalid), F O T U N (invalid), G O T U N (invalid), H O T U N (invalid), L O T U N (invalid), M O T U N (invalid), V O T U N (invalid).

Wait, let me think of actual valid English words that fit:
- Words with O in 2 and U in 4: ""COBUX"" (invalid), ""COGUM"" (invalid), ""COYUN"" (invalid), ""CONUT"" (invalid), ""COTUN"" (invalid), ""FOGUM"" (invalid), ""GONUT"" (invalid), ""HONUT"" (invalid), ""MONUT"" (invalid), ""TONUT"" (invalid).

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a letter or position. Let me re-examine the constraints carefully.

Actually, looking back, the word must have:
- O in position 2
- U in position 4
- Contain N and T (but N not in 3, T not in 5)
- Avoid A, R, S, E, P, I, D

Valid word: ""CONUT"" – but this has N in 3 which is forbidden.
""TONIC"" – contains I which is forbidden.
""NOVUM"" – has M and U, but N in 1, T in 3 (but T must be in 1 or 3, N in 1 or 5). Wait, ""NOVUM"" has U in 4, O in 2, N in 1, T in 3, M in 5. But T is in 3 which is allowed (T not in 5), N in 1 is allowed (N not in 3). This seems valid.

Check letters:
- N in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (correct)
- T in 3 (allowed, since T not in 5)
- U in 4 (correct)
- M in 5 (new, allowed)
Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, D – none present.

""NOVUM"" is a valid English word (Latin for ""new""), but is it in standard English dictionaries? It might be considered obscure. However, it fits all constraints.

Alternative: ""CONUT"" – but N is in 3 which is forbidden.
""TONUT"" – invalid word.
""MONUT"" – invalid.
""FOGUM"" – invalid.

""NOVUM"" seems to be the only valid option fitting all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- It definitely does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

A good next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels while placing O in a different spot. The word “POINT” comes to mind because:
- It places O in position 2 (different from the previous position 3).
- It introduces P, I, N, T – all common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

Let’s go with POINT.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is definitely O.
- The word contains N and T, but they are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- N somewhere other than position 4.
- T somewhere other than position 5.
- No A, R, S, E, P, I.

Let’s look for a word that fits these constraints. One candidate is “CONNO” but that repeats O unnecessarily and has no T. Another candidate is “TONIC” but it contains I which we know is not in the word. “DONUT” has U and D which are new letters to test, and fits:
- O in position 2.
- N not in position 4 (it’s in position 3).
- T not in position 5 (it’s in position 1).
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s try DONUT.

Guess 3: DONUT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(-) U(✓) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DONUT:
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = U
- The word contains N and T, but:
  – N ≠ position 3
  – T ≠ position 5
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, D

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- U in position 4
- N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 allowed, but not 4)
- T somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 allowed, but not 5)
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s list possible positions for N and T:
N can be in 1, 3, or 5 (but 2 is O, 4 is U)
T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 2 is O, 4 is U) → T can be in 1 or 3.

Case 1: T in position 1
Then N must be in 3 or 5.
Word structure: T O _ U _
If N is in 3: T O N U _
Last letter must be new and allowed (not forbidden). Let’s try B → TONUB (but not a word).
Try M → TONUM (not a word).
Try L → TONUL (not a word).
Try K → TONUK (not a word).
No valid words here.

Case 2: T in position 3
Then N can be in 1 or 5.
Word structure: _ O T U _
If N is in 1: N O T U _
Last letter must be new and allowed. Try B → NOTUB (invalid).
Try L → NOTUL (invalid).
Try K → NOTUK (invalid).
No valid words.

If N is in 5: _ O T U N
First letter must be new and allowed. Try B → BOTUN (invalid).
Try C → CO TUN (invalid).
Try F → FOTUN (invalid).
Try G → GOTUN (invalid).
Try H → H O T U N → HOTUN (invalid).
Try L → L O T U N → LOTUN (invalid).
Try M → M O T U N → MOTUN (invalid).
Try V → V O T U N → VOTUN (invalid).
None of these are valid English words.

Hmm, maybe we missed something. Let me re-examine possible letters and positions.

Alternative approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2 and U in position 4, containing N and T, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible structure: _ O _ U _
Letters allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding forbidden).

We need N and T in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 2 and 4 are fixed).

Possible combinations:
- N in 1, T in 3: N O T U _ → need last letter. Try N O T U B (invalid), N O T U M (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 1, T in 5: N O _ U T → need letter in 3. Try N O B U T (invalid), N O C U T (invalid), N O G U T (invalid), N O L U T (invalid), N O M U T (invalid), N O V U T (invalid). No valid word.
- N in 3, T in 1: T O N U _ → last letter. Try T O N U B (invalid), T O N U M (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 3, T in 5: _ O N U T → first letter. Try B O N U T (invalid), C O N U T (invalid), F O N U T (invalid), G O N U T (invalid), H O N U T (invalid), L O N U T (invalid), M O N U T (invalid), V O N U T (invalid). No valid word.
- N in 5, T in 1: T O _ U N → middle letter. Try T O B U N (invalid), T O C U N (invalid), etc. No valid word.
- N in 5, T in 3: _ O T U N → first letter. Try B O T U N (invalid), C O T U N (invalid), F O T U N (invalid), G O T U N (invalid), H O T U N (invalid), L O T U N (invalid), M O T U N (invalid), V O T U N (invalid).

Wait, let me think of actual valid English words that fit:
- Words with O in 2 and U in 4: ""COBUX"" (invalid), ""COGUM"" (invalid), ""COYUN"" (invalid), ""CONUT"" (invalid), ""COTUN"" (invalid), ""FOGUM"" (invalid), ""GONUT"" (invalid), ""HONUT"" (invalid), ""MONUT"" (invalid), ""TONUT"" (invalid).

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a letter or position. Let me re-examine the constraints carefully.

Actually, looking back, the word must have:
- O in position 2
- U in position 4
- Contain N and T (but N not in 3, T not in 5)
- Avoid A, R, S, E, P, I, D

Valid word: ""CONUT"" – but this has N in 3 which is forbidden.
""TONIC"" – contains I which is forbidden.
""NOVUM"" – has M and U, but N in 1, T in 3 (but T must be in 1 or 3, N in 1 or 5). Wait, ""NOVUM"" has U in 4, O in 2, N in 1, T in 3, M in 5. But T is in 3 which is allowed (T not in 5), N in 1 is allowed (N not in 3). This seems valid.

Check letters:
- N in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (correct)
- T in 3 (allowed, since T not in 5)
- U in 4 (correct)
- M in 5 (new, allowed)
Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, D – none present.

""NOVUM"" is a valid English word (Latin for ""new""), but is it in standard English dictionaries? It might be considered obscure. However, it fits all constraints.

Alternative: ""CONUT"" – but N is in 3 which is forbidden.
""TONUT"" – invalid word.
""MONUT"" – invalid.
""FOGUM"" – invalid.

""NOVUM"" seems to be the only valid option fitting all constraints.

From the feedback on NOXUM:
- N(✓) – position 1 correct
- O(✓) – position 2 correct
- X(x) – X is not in the word
- U(✓) – position 4 correct
- M(✓) – position 5 correct

So the word is N O _ U M and the only remaining letter is position 3.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, D, V, X  
Valid letters for position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, W, Y, Z  

Looking at English 5-letter words matching N O _ U M, the only common one is:
- NOBUM (not a standard word)
- NOGUM (not a standard word)
- NOCUM (not a standard word)
- NOFUM (not a standard word)
- NOLYM (not a standard word)

However, ""NOGUM"" is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic term, but it's not standard. The only fully valid standard word fitting N O _ U M is **NOBUM** (but it's not recognized). 

Rechecking, the actual valid English word that fits N O _ U M is **NOGUM** (which is obsolete for ""nog"" + ""um""), but since we need a valid guess, we must have missed something. 

Upon closer inspection, the correct and only valid standard word fitting this pattern is **NOGUM** (though it's rare). However, in standard Wordle dictionaries, the word is **NOGUM** (as in ""nogum"" from ""nog""), but it's not common.

Given the constraints, the only possible word is **NOGUM**.

But wait—let's double-check: are there any other valid English words?  
- **NOBLY** – doesn't fit (Y is at end, but we need M at 5)  
- **NOVUM** – already tried (V is forbidden)  
- **NOMUL** – doesn't fit (U is at 4, but NOMUL has U at 3)  

Actually, the correct and only valid English word fitting N O _ U M is **NOGUM**.

However, in standard Wordle word lists, the word is **NOGUM** (from ""nog""), but it's quite obscure. 

Given the feedback, the word must be N O _ U M with the third letter not being any of the forbidden ones. The only valid guess left is **NOGUM**.

But to be absolutely certain, let's check if there's another valid word: **NOBLY** (no), **NOVUM** (V forbidden), **NOCUM** (no), **NOLYM** (no). 

Thus, the correct word must be **NOGUM**.
