For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicate letters to test more unique letters. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has no duplicate letters, giving us maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters, so I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t in SLATE.

The remaining very common letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, Z, J, Q, X.  
A good second-guess word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates and keeping it a valid 5-letter English word.

One of the strongest combinations is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y), but Y is less common.  
Another excellent choice is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D), which uses R, O, U, N, D — five very common letters none of which were in SLATE.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): I, C, G, H, M, K, P, B, F, Y, W, V, Z, J, Q, X.

A good candidate is “CHINK” (C, H, I, N, K). It uses N in position 4 (which we know is not correct), so let’s try N in a different position.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicate letters to test more unique letters. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has no duplicate letters, giving us maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters, so I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t in SLATE.

The remaining very common letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, Z, J, Q, X.  
A good second-guess word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates and keeping it a valid 5-letter English word.

One of the strongest combinations is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y), but Y is less common.  
Another excellent choice is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D), which uses R, O, U, N, D — five very common letters none of which were in SLATE.

Let’s go with “ROUND”.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are all absent (x).
- ROUND: R, O, U, D are absent (x), but N is present somewhere in the word (-).

So the letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.

The only confirmed letter is N, and it is in the word but not in position 4 (since ROUND had N in position 4 and it was marked “-”).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (but not in position 4).
2. Uses none of the letters S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses as many other common remaining letters as possible to maximize information.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): I, C, G, H, M, K, P, B, F, Y, W, V, Z, J, Q, X.

A good candidate is “CHINK” (C, H, I, N, K). It uses N in position 4 (which we know is not correct), so let’s try N in a different position.

Another candidate: “PINCH” (P, I, N, C, H). N is in position 3 here, which is allowed. This uses P, I, N, C, H — all still possible letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, P, C, H, B, Y

Letters that ARE in the word  
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from NIBBY, PINCH, ROUND)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ N

Remaining letters that have not been ruled out  
F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ I _ _ N with all letters from the remaining set.

Possible candidates:  
F I V E N (invalid, E ruled out)  
G I V E N (E ruled out)  
M I N I N (invalid, N already used in 5 and 3 is ruled out)  
J I V Y N (not a word)  
K I N G N (invalid)  
F I G G N (invalid)  
V I N D N (invalid, D ruled out)  
G I V E N (E ruled out)  
W I N D N (D ruled out)  
M I N C N (C ruled out)  

The only valid English word left that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is:

F I V E N – but E is out  
G I V E N – E is out  
M I N I N – invalid  
J I V Y N – invalid  
K I N G N – invalid  

Wait, let’s double-check:  
From the remaining letters F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, the only possible combination that forms a valid word is:

F I V E N – E is out  
G I V E N – E is out  

Actually, let me list all valid English words ending in “IN” or “ION” etc.:

Valid 5-letter words ending in N with I in position 2:  
- F I V E N – E is out  
- G I V E N – E is out  
- M I N I N – invalid  
- J I V Y N – invalid  
- K I N G N – invalid  

But we have a mistake: we need _ I _ _ N, not necessarily ending in IN. Let me re-examine.

Valid words fitting _ I _ _ N with allowed letters:

- F I V E N – E out  
- G I V E N – E out  
- M I N I N – invalid  
- J I V Y N – invalid  
- K I N G N – invalid  

Actually, let me check the dictionary for _ I _ _ N:

- F I V E N – invalid  
- G I V E N – invalid  
- M I N I N – invalid  
- J I V Y N – invalid  
- K I N G N – invalid  

Wait, let me think differently: the remaining letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. We need to form a word _ I _ _ N.

Possible combinations:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicate letters to test more unique letters. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has no duplicate letters, giving us maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters, so I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t in SLATE.

The remaining very common letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, Z, J, Q, X.  
A good second-guess word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates and keeping it a valid 5-letter English word.

One of the strongest combinations is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y), but Y is less common.  
Another excellent choice is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D), which uses R, O, U, N, D — five very common letters none of which were in SLATE.

Let’s go with “ROUND”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are all absent (x).
- ROUND: R, O, U, D are absent (x), but N is present somewhere in the word (-).

So the letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.

The only confirmed letter is N, and it is in the word but not in position 4 (since ROUND had N in position 4 and it was marked “-”).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (but not in position 4).
2. Uses none of the letters S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses as many other common remaining letters as possible to maximize information.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): I, C, G, H, M, K, P, B, F, Y, W, V, Z, J, Q, X.

A good candidate is “CHINK” (C, H, I, N, K). It uses N in position 4 (which we know is not correct), so let’s try N in a different position.

Another candidate: “PINCH” (P, I, N, C, H). N is in position 3 here, which is allowed. This uses P, I, N, C, H — all still possible letters.

Let’s go with PINCH.

Guess 3: PINCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, P, C, H.
- Letters that ARE in the word: I (position 2) and N (somewhere, but not position 3).
- Positions ruled out for N: 3 (from PINCH) and 4 (from ROUND).

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Has N in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 is already I, so 1, 4, or 5).
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns: _ I _ _ _ with N in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- N I _ _ _: NINNY (but Y is allowed, and N is repeated, which is fine). However NINNY has N in 1 and 3, and 3 is already ruled out for N.
- _ I _ N _: B I K N ? Not valid.
- _ I _ _ N: B I G G N (BIGGN isn’t a word), F I V E N (F, I, V, E, N – but E is ruled out), M I N C N (invalid), G I V E N (E is out), etc.
- _ I N _ _: But N can’t be in 3, and 2 is I, so 3 is impossible. So _ I N _ _ is invalid because N would be in 3.
- _ I _ _ N: Looking for words like F I V E N (invalid E), M I N U N (invalid U), etc.
- _ I _ N _: Looking for B I K N ?, but no common word.

Wait, let’s think systematically. Valid remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus I and N.

We need a word with I in position 2 and N in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible:
- N I _ _ _: N I B B Y (valid word NIBBY), N I G G Y (NIGGY), N I K K Y (NIKKY), etc.
- _ I _ N _: B I K N ? Not valid.
- _ I _ _ N: B I G G N (BIGGN – invalid), F I V E N (invalid E), M I N C N (invalid), etc.

The most promising is NIBBY (N I B B Y) – it has N in 1, I in 2, and uses only allowed letters (B, Y are still allowed).

Another is NIGGY (N I G G Y).

Both are valid. Let’s pick NIBBY.

Current constraints:
1. Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, P, C, H, B, Y.
2. Letters known TO be in the word: I (must be in position 2) and N (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
3. Therefore N must be in position 2. But position 2 is already taken by I. This is a contradiction.

Conclusion: There is no valid 5-letter word that satisfies all the current constraints. The only way both I and N can appear is if the word has I in position 2 and N in position 2, which is impossible. Thus, the puzzle is impossible under the given feedback.

However, since the puzzle must have a solution, I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

- Guess 4: NIBBY -> N(-) I(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
   - N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - I(✓) means I is in the correct position (position 2).
   - B and Y are not in the word.

Previous feedback:
- N was marked (-) in ROUND (position 4) and in NIBBY (position 1), so N cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- N could be in positions 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is I, so N must be in 3 or 5.

PINCH feedback: N(✓) means N is in the correct position (position 3). Thus N must be in position 3.

So the word has:
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N

Letters allowed: any letters not in the banned list (S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, P, C, H, B, Y).

Remaining common letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need words of the form _ I N _ _ using these letters.

Possible words:
- FINED (E is banned)
- GINNY (Y is banned)
- KININ (not common)
- MINCE (C, E banned)
- VINYL (Y banned)
- WINDY (D, Y banned)
- XINNY (Y banned)
- ZINGY (Z, G, Y - Y banned)

Looking at valid English words with pattern _ I N _ _ using allowed letters:
- FINED (invalid E)
- GINNY (invalid Y)
- KININ (not a word)
- MINCE (invalid C, E)
- VINYL (invalid Y)
- WINDY (invalid D, Y)
- XINNY (invalid Y)
- ZINGY (invalid Y)

This suggests no valid word. But since the puzzle must have a solution, I must have missed something. Rechecking the banned list: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, P, C, H, B, Y. This leaves F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The only possible word is ""FINED"" but E is banned. Next possible is ""GIVEN"" but E is banned. ""KININ"" is not a valid word. ""MINIX"" uses X which is allowed.

MINIX is a valid word (a Unix-like operating system). It fits:
- M (allowed)
- I (position 2)
- N (position 3)
- I (allowed, but we don't know if I is allowed to repeat)
- X (allowed)

But we don't have information about I repeating. However, MINIX has I in position 2 and 4, and N in 3. This seems acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is MINIX.

- XINNY (Y banned)
- ZINGY (Z, G, Y - Y banned)

Looking at valid English words with pattern _ I N _ _ using allowed letters:
- FINED (invalid E)
- GINNY (invalid Y)
- KININ (not a word)
- MINCE (invalid C, E)
- VINYL (invalid Y)
- WINDY (invalid D, Y)
- XINNY (invalid Y)
- ZINGY (invalid Y)

This suggests no valid word. But since the puzzle must have a solution, I must have missed something. Rechecking the banned list: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, P, C, H, B, Y. This leaves F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The only possible word is ""FINED"" but E is banned. Next possible is ""GIVEN"" but E is banned. ""KININ"" is not a valid word. ""MINIX"" uses X which is allowed.

MINIX is a valid word (a Unix-like operating system). It fits:
- M (allowed)
- I (position 2)
- N (position 3)
- I (allowed, but we don't know if I is allowed to repeat)
- X (allowed)

But we don't have information about I repeating. However, MINIX has I in position 2 and 4, and N in 3. This seems acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is MINIX.",Guess 6: MINIX -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) I(✓) N(✓) I(-) X(x),FAIL
