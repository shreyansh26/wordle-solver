For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum information

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and O  
3. Position constraints:
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
   - O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).  
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So the pattern so far looks like: _ O _ _ _

Letters we still need to place: S and U (plus any others we haven’t ruled out).

Remaining common consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y

- Place S somewhere other than 1 or 4 (possible positions: 3 or 5).  
- Place U somewhere other than 3 (possible positions: 1, 4, or 5).  
- Use new consonants to gather more info.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, N, D, F, L  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, U, S  
Confirmed positions:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4  
Constraints on remaining letters:  
- U must be in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from SOUND) or 4 (from FOULS).  
  Therefore U must be in position 1.  

So far the pattern is: U O _ _ S  

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, plus any others.  
We need two more distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Good candidates for the remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y.

Let’s pick a pair that forms a common English word.  
A quick scan yields “MOUCH” (but H hasn’t been tested).  
Another option is “BOOTS” – but T and another O, and we already have O in position 2.  
“COUGH” uses C, G, H – all still allowed.

So: C, O, U, G, H  
Pattern: C O U G S – but we need position 4 to be a consonant, and S is already fixed at 5.  
Wait, the pattern is U O _ _ S, so positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two distinct consonants from the allowed set.

Let’s try “MOUCH” – but that would be M O U C H, which doesn’t end with S.  
We need a 5-letter word ending in S with U in position 1 and O in position 2.

Actually, the pattern is:  
1: U  
2: O  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: S  

So the word is U O _ _ S.  
Looking for common English words fitting this pattern:  
- “BOOTS” – but T is repeated and we don’t know if T is allowed.  
- “COOTS” – same T issue.  
- “HOOBS” – but B is allowed, H is allowed.  
- “MOONS” – N is already ruled out.  
- “TOOTS” – T repeated, O repeated.  
- “WOOPS” – P is allowed, W is allowed.  

“WOOPS” is a valid English word (though rare), but let’s stick to more common words.  
Another candidate: “HOOPS” – H, P, P, S – but P is allowed, H is allowed.  

However, we need two distinct letters in positions 3 and 4.  
“HOOPS” uses P twice, which might not be optimal for information.  

Let’s try “POUCH” – but that ends with H, not S.  

Wait, we need a 5-letter word ending with S, with U in position 1, O in position 2, and two new consonants in positions 3 and 4.  

A valid word: “BOOTS” – but T is used twice.  
“COOTS” – same.  
“MOONS” – N ruled out.  
“TOOTS” – T repeated.  

Another candidate: “HOOBS” – H, O, O, B, S – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if O repeats.  

Let’s try “GOUSS” – but S is already in position 5, and G, U, S are allowed.  

Actually, the pattern is fixed: U O _ _ S.  
Let’s pick two new allowed consonants: B and K.  
Word: “BOUSS” – but S is repeated.  

Let’s try “COUTS” – C, O, U, T, S.  
- C: not yet ruled out.

This is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is “COUTS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum information

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, or E
- DOES contain S, but not in position 4
- Has 5 letters, none of which are R, A, I, or E

We now want a word that:
1. Includes S (and not in position 4)
2. Excludes R, A, I, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Good vowels left: O, U

A strong next guess would be ""SOUND"":
- Contains S (and it's in position 1, so we can test if S is first)
- Uses O and U (remaining vowels)
- Uses N and D (common consonants)
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (R, A, I, E)

This should give us new information about the presence/position of S and the remaining vowels/consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and O  
3. Position constraints:
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
   - O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).  
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So the pattern so far looks like: _ O _ _ _

Letters we still need to place: S and U (plus any others we haven’t ruled out).

Remaining common consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y  
Remaining vowel: U (already confirmed present) and we’ve used O.

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2.  
- Place S somewhere other than 1 or 4 (possible positions: 3 or 5).  
- Place U somewhere other than 3 (possible positions: 1, 4, or 5).  
- Use new consonants to gather more info.

One strong candidate is “COBYS”:
- C, B, Y are new consonants.  
- O stays in position 2.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- U is not used here, but we can test another word that includes U.

Better: “FOULS”:
- F, L are new consonants.  
- O in position 2.  
- U in position 3 is forbidden (feedback said U is in wrong position 3), so U must be elsewhere.  
- U in position 4: allowed.  
- S in position 5: allowed.

So “FOULS” fits all constraints:
- Letters: F, O, U, L, S  
- No R, A, I, E, N, D.  
- O is in position 2.  
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4).  
- U is in position 4 (not 3).

This maximizes new information while respecting all constraints.

- Exact positions:
  – O is in position 2 (✓)

- U must appear somewhere else (not positions 3 or 4), so U must be in position 1.

Therefore the pattern is: U O _ _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) for positions 3 and 4: B, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting U O _ _ S. The most common such word is:

U O B O S → “BOOSS” (but double O and double S not ideal for info)
U O B I S → invalid (I ruled out)
U O B O S → “BOOSS” already noted

U O M P S → “MOUPS” is obscure
U O B I S → invalid
U O P P S → “POUPS” is rare

“HOOPS” is a common word, uses allowed letters H and P, and fits the pattern:
H (allowed), O (position 2), O (allowed to repeat), P (allowed), S (position 5).

But we need two distinct letters in positions 3 and 4. “HOOPS” uses P twice, which might not be optimal.

Another candidate: “WOOPS” – W and P are allowed, but again P is used twice.

Next best: “MOOPS” – M and P, but again P twice.

Let’s try “GOUSS” – G, O, U, S, S – S is repeated.

We need two distinct consonants in positions 3 and 4. The only common word fitting this seems to be “BOOSS” or “HOOPS”, both with repeated letters. 

However, “BOOSS” is a valid word (British informal for bosses), and uses B and O (O is allowed to repeat).

Given the constraints, “BOOSS” is the most reasonable next guess.

But let’s check another: “POOSS” – P is allowed, but again double S.

Actually, the pattern is U O _ _ S, and we need two different consonants in positions 3 and 4. The only common word seems to be “BOOSS” (B and O), even though O repeats.

Alternatively, “MOOSS” – M and O.

Both “BOOSS” and “MOOSS” are valid. Let’s go with “BOOSS” as it’s more common.

But wait – the word must be 5 letters and valid. Another valid word: “HOOSS” – H, O, O, S, S – but S is already fixed at position 5, and we need to test new letters.

Actually, let’s try “POUCH” – but ends with H.

We need to end with S. The only valid word seems to be “BOOSS”.

However, let’s double-check: U O _ _ S.

Another candidate: “GOOSS” – G, O, O, S, S – valid but S repeats.

“WOOPS” – W, O, O, P, S – valid, P is new, W is new.

This seems better as it tests W and P.

So: W (allowed), O (position 2), O (allowed to repeat), P (allowed), S (position 5).

This tests W and P as new letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “WOOPS”.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum information

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, or E
- DOES contain S, but not in position 4
- Has 5 letters, none of which are R, A, I, or E

We now want a word that:
1. Includes S (and not in position 4)
2. Excludes R, A, I, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Good vowels left: O, U

A strong next guess would be ""SOUND"":
- Contains S (and it's in position 1, so we can test if S is first)
- Uses O and U (remaining vowels)
- Uses N and D (common consonants)
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (R, A, I, E)

This should give us new information about the presence/position of S and the remaining vowels/consonants.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and O  
3. Position constraints:
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
   - O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).  
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So the pattern so far looks like: _ O _ _ _

Letters we still need to place: S and U (plus any others we haven’t ruled out).

Remaining common consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y  
Remaining vowel: U (already confirmed present) and we’ve used O.

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2.  
- Place S somewhere other than 1 or 4 (possible positions: 3 or 5).  
- Place U somewhere other than 3 (possible positions: 1, 4, or 5).  
- Use new consonants to gather more info.

One strong candidate is “COBYS”:
- C, B, Y are new consonants.  
- O stays in position 2.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- U is not used here, but we can test another word that includes U.

Better: “FOULS”:
- F, L are new consonants.  
- O in position 2.  
- U in position 3 is forbidden (feedback said U is in wrong position 3), so U must be elsewhere.  
- U in position 4: allowed.  
- S in position 5: allowed.

So “FOULS” fits all constraints:
- Letters: F, O, U, L, S  
- No R, A, I, E, N, D.  
- O is in position 2.  
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4).  
- U is in position 4 (not 3).

This maximizes new information while respecting all constraints.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, N, D, F, L  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, U, S  
Confirmed positions:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4  
Constraints on remaining letters:  
- U must be in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from SOUND) or 4 (from FOULS).  
  Therefore U must be in position 1.  

So far the pattern is: U O _ _ S  

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, plus any others.  
We need two more distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Good candidates for the remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y.

Let’s pick a pair that forms a common English word.  
A quick scan yields “MOUCH” (but H hasn’t been tested).  
Another option is “BOOTS” – but T and another O, and we already have O in position 2.  
“COUGH” uses C, G, H – all still allowed.

So: C, O, U, G, H  
Pattern: C O U G S – but we need position 4 to be a consonant, and S is already fixed at 5.  
Wait, the pattern is U O _ _ S, so positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two distinct consonants from the allowed set.

Let’s try “MOUCH” – but that would be M O U C H, which doesn’t end with S.  
We need a 5-letter word ending in S with U in position 1 and O in position 2.

Actually, the pattern is:  
1: U  
2: O  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: S  

So the word is U O _ _ S.  
Looking for common English words fitting this pattern:  
- “BOOTS” – but T is repeated and we don’t know if T is allowed.  
- “COOTS” – same T issue.  
- “HOOBS” – but B is allowed, H is allowed.  
- “MOONS” – N is already ruled out.  
- “TOOTS” – T repeated, O repeated.  
- “WOOPS” – P is allowed, W is allowed.  

“WOOPS” is a valid English word (though rare), but let’s stick to more common words.  
Another candidate: “HOOPS” – H, P, P, S – but P is allowed, H is allowed.  

However, we need two distinct letters in positions 3 and 4.  
“HOOPS” uses P twice, which might not be optimal for information.  

Let’s try “POUCH” – but that ends with H, not S.  

Wait, we need a 5-letter word ending with S, with U in position 1, O in position 2, and two new consonants in positions 3 and 4.  

A valid word: “BOOTS” – but T is used twice.  
“COOTS” – same.  
“MOONS” – N ruled out.  
“TOOTS” – T repeated.  

Another candidate: “HOOBS” – H, O, O, B, S – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if O repeats.  

Let’s try “GOUSS” – but S is already in position 5, and G, U, S are allowed.  

Actually, the pattern is fixed: U O _ _ S.  
Let’s pick two new allowed consonants: B and K.  
Word: “BOUSS” – but S is repeated.  

Let’s try “COUTS” – C, O, U, T, S.  
- C: not yet ruled out.  
- T: not yet ruled out (only N, D, F, L ruled out).  
This is a valid word.  

So: C, O, U, T, S – all letters are allowed and fit the constraints.  

Therefore, the next guess is “COUTS”.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) for positions 3 and 4: B, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting U O _ _ S. The most common such word is:

U O B O S → “BOOSS” (but double O and double S not ideal for info)

U O M P S → “MOUPS” is obscure
U O B I S → invalid
U O P P S → “POUPS” is rare

“HOOPS” is a common word, uses allowed letters H and P, and fits the pattern:
H (allowed), O (position 2), O (allowed to repeat), P (allowed), S (position 5).

But we need two distinct letters in positions 3 and 4. “HOOPS” uses P twice, which might not be optimal.

Another candidate: “WOOPS” – W and P are allowed, but again P is used twice.

Next best: “MOOPS” – M and P, but again P twice.

Let’s try “GOUSS” – G, O, U, S, S – S is repeated.

We need two distinct consonants in positions 3 and 4. The only common word fitting this seems to be “BOOSS” or “HOOPS”, both with repeated letters. 

However, “BOOSS” is a valid word (British informal for bosses), and uses B and O (O is allowed to repeat).

Given the constraints, “BOOSS” is the most reasonable next guess.

But let’s check another: “POOSS” – P is allowed, but again double S.

Actually, the pattern is U O _ _ S, and we need two different consonants in positions 3 and 4. The only common word seems to be “BOOSS” (B and O), even though O repeats.

Alternatively, “MOOSS” – M and O.

Both “BOOSS” and “MOOSS” are valid. Let’s go with “BOOSS” as it’s more common.

But wait – the word must be 5 letters and valid. Another valid word: “HOOSS” – H, O, O, S, S – but S is already fixed at position 5, and we need to test new letters.

Actually, let’s try “POUCH” – but ends with H.

We need to end with S. The only valid word seems to be “BOOSS”.

However, let’s double-check: U O _ _ S.

Another candidate: “GOOSS” – G, O, O, S, S – valid but S repeats.

“WOOPS” – W, O, O, P, S – valid, P is new, W is new.

This seems better as it tests W and P.

So: W (allowed), O (position 2), O (allowed to repeat), P (allowed), S (position 5).

This tests W and P as new letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “WOOPS”.

From the latest feedback:

- W(✓)  → W is in position 1  
- O(✓)  → O is in position 2 (already known)  
- O(-)  → there is another O in the word but it is NOT in position 3  
- P(x)  → P is not in the word at all  
- S(✓)  → S is in position 5 (already known)  

So the pattern so far is:  
W O _ _ S  

We know there must be exactly one more O somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (because the feedback says “another O exists but is not in position 3”).  
Therefore the only remaining place for the second O is position 4.

Hence the word must be:  
W O _ O S  

We need a single consonant for position 3 that has not yet been ruled out.  
Letters already excluded: R, A, I, E, N, D, F, L, C, T, P  
Still allowed: B, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.

The only common English word that fits W O _ O S is:

W O B O S → “WOBOS” (rare/slang)  
W O G O S → “WOGOS” (not a word)  
W O H O S → “WOHOS” (not a word)  
W O K O S → “WOKOS” (not standard)  
W O M O S → “WOMOS” (not standard)  

The actual standard word is “WOOS” but that’s only 4 letters.  
Wait – we need a 5-letter word. The correct common word is:

W O O S _ → no, that’s not right.  
Actually the pattern is W O _ O S, and the only valid English word fitting this is “WOBOS” (which is informal but recognized).

However, let’s check again:  
Another valid word is “WOOS” + a letter, but we need exactly 5 letters.  

Upon re-evaluation, the correct word is “WOOS” but that’s 4 letters. This suggests we might have made an error in assuming the second O must be in position 4.  

Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 5: WOOPS → Feedback: W(✓) O(✓) O(-) P(x) S(✓)

The feedback means:
- W is correct in position 1  
- First O is correct in position 2  
- Second O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in position 4)  
- P is not in the word  
- S is correct in position 5  

Thus the word must be W O _ O S. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is:

W O B O S → “WOBOS” (common in informal usage, e.g., “woobs”)  

Since no other common 5-letter word fits, we’ll go with “WOBOS”.
