### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, I, P.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R and S.
   - R is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 again (from TRIPS).
   - S is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 5 (from TRIPS).

So R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2), and S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need a word that:
- Contains both R and S.
- Places R somewhere other than position 2.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, E, T, I, P).

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E, I are out).

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and R in position 1, and fill the remaining spots with common unused letters.

Candidate word: S R _ _ _

We need three more letters, none of which are forbidden. Let’s pick N, U, and D (all unused and common).

Word formed: SRUND – but that’s not a valid English word.

Alternative: S _ R _ _ with remaining letters. Let’s try S U R N _ – but we need a 5-letter word.

How about S U R N D? Not valid.

Another approach: S _ _ R _ with S in 1 and R in 4. Then we need three letters in positions 2,3,5.

Let’s try S U N R L – not a word.

Let’s try S C R U N – valid word? SCRUM? No.

How about S N U R K – not valid.

Let’s try R _ _ _ _ with R in 1. Then S must be in 2-3.

R U S E D – but E is out.

R U S H Y – valid word, uses R and S, no forbidden letters.

Check letters: R (position 1), U, S (position 3), H, Y – none are forbidden.

This looks like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):
A, O, E, T, I, P, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):
- R (in word, but NOT in positions 1, 2)  
- S (in word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5)  
- U (in word, and in position 2)  
- Y (in word, and in position 5)

So the pattern so far is:
_ U _ _ Y

We still need to place R and S in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 3, 4), with the constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (already ruled out).  
- S cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5.  

That leaves only one possible spot for S: position 1.  
And R must then go in either position 3 or 4.

Remaining unused letters (all consonants, since vowels A, O, E, I, U are accounted for):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need one more consonant to fill the remaining slot.  
Let’s pick the most common remaining consonant, N.

Possible words:
S U R N Y  – but N is in position 4, R in 3.  
Check if SURN… forms a valid 5-letter word: “SURNY” is not valid.  
Next: S U N R Y – “SUNRY” is also invalid.  
Try S U C R Y – “SUCRY” is invalid.  
Try S U B R Y – “SUBRY” is invalid.  
Try S U L R Y – “SULRY” is invalid.  
Try S U D R Y – “SUDRY” is invalid.  
Try S U G R Y – “SUGRY” is invalid.  
Try S U F R Y – “SUFRY” is invalid.  
Try S U M R Y – “SUMRY” is invalid.  
Try S U V R Y – “SUVR Y” is invalid.  
Try S U W R Y – “SUWR Y” is invalid.  
Try S U Z R Y – “SUZRY” is invalid.  
Try S U K R Y – “SU KRY” is invalid.  

Hmm, none of these are valid English words.  
Let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully.

We have:
- S must be in position 1 (only spot left).  
- R must be in position 3 or 4.  
- U is fixed in position 2.  
- Y is fixed in position 5.  

The remaining letter (position 3 or 4) must be a consonant not yet used.  
We need a valid English word of the form:
S U _ _ Y
with R in position 3 or 4, and one other consonant.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- S U C C Y – invalid (C repeated, and C is allowed but word is not).  
- S U B B Y – invalid.  
- S U N N Y – valid word!  
  Letters: S, U, N, N, Y  
  R is not used here, but we know R must be in the word.  
  So “SUNNY” is invalid because it omits R.  

Wait, we must include both R and S.  
Thus the word must contain S, U, R, and Y, plus one more consonant.  

Let’s list all 5-letter words containing S, U, R, Y, and one more consonant, fitting _ U _ _ Y with S in 1 and R in 3 or 4.

Possible combinations:
- S U R _ Y → need one consonant in position 4.  
  Valid word: S U R G Y – “SURGY” is invalid.  
  S U R F Y – “SURFY” is valid!  
  Check letters: S, U, R, F, Y – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  

“SURFY” fits perfectly:
- S in position 1 (allowed).  
- U in position 2 (matches ✓).  
- R in position 3 (allowed).  
- F in position 4 (new, unused).  
- Y in position 5 (matches ✓).  

No conflicts with any previous feedback.
