### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or A.
- Contains R, N, E, but each in a different position than before.

Known letters: R, N, E (all must appear once).
Known positions:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be (originally) in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, N, E plus two other letters (not C or A), with the positional constraints above.

Possible candidates:
- R, N, E must be placed in new positions.
- Let’s try to place R in positions 1,3,4,5; N in positions 1,2,3,5; E in positions 1,2,3,4.

A word that satisfies these: ""RENTS"" (R,E,N,T,S).
Check:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- N in position 3 (allowed).
- T and S are new letters (not C or A).

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: C, A
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, N, E

2. RENTS → R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T, S
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, E, N

So far we know the secret word must contain exactly the letters {R, N, E} plus two more letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not C, A, T, S).

Positions ruled out:
- R: cannot be 2 (from CRANE) or 1 (from RENTS)
- E: cannot be 5 (from CRANE) or 2 (from RENTS)
- N: cannot be 4 (from CRANE) or 3 (from RENTS)

Remaining possible positions:
- R: 3, 4, 5
- E: 1, 3, 4
- N: 1, 2, 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, N, E once each and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding C, A, T, S). Let’s pick two common unused letters: D and I.

Possible word: ""DINER""
Check:
- Letters: D, I, N, E, R – uses N, E, R and two new letters.
- Positions:
  - D (new, no restriction)
  - I (new, no restriction)
  - N in position 3 – allowed (only 3 was ruled out for N, but 3 is allowed here)
  - E in position 4 – allowed
  - R in position 5 – allowed

This satisfies all constraints.

N:

So remaining legal positions:

We still need two more letters (not C, A, T, S, D, and distinct from R, N, E).  
Common unused letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Pick two: let’s try B and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, N, E exactly once each.
- Contains B and I exactly once each.
- Meets the positional restrictions above.

Candidate word: “BRINE”
Check positions:
B – new, no restriction  
R – position 2 → but R is forbidden at 2 (from CRANE) ❌  
So BRINE is invalid.

Next candidate: “BIRNR” – invalid (repeats R and not a word).

Try “NERVE” – repeats E and has 5 letters but E already appears once.  
Try “PERKY” – lacks R, N, E.

Let’s systematically build:

We have letters: R, N, E, plus two new ones (say B and I).

Permutations that satisfy the positional constraints:

One valid arrangement:
- Position 1: N (allowed)
- Position 2: I (new, allowed)
- Position 3: E (allowed)
- Position 4: B (new, allowed)
- Position 5: R (allowed)

Word: N I E B R → “NIEBR” – not a valid English word.

Another arrangement:
- 1: B
- 2: N
- 3: E
- 4: R
- 5: I

Word: B N E R I → “BNERI” – invalid.

Another:
- 1: E
- 2: N
- 3: I
- 4: B
- 5: R

Word: E N I B R → “ENIBR” – invalid.

Try with different new letters: G and L.

Valid arrangement:
- 1: N
- 2: G
- 3: E
- 4: R
- 5: L

Word: N G E R L → “NGERL” – invalid.

Try “LARGE” – has A (forbidden).

Try “FLIER” – has I and R, but F is new, L is new.

Check positions:
F – new  
L – new  
I – position 3 (allowed)  
E – position 4 (allowed)  
R – position 5 (allowed)

Word: F L I E R – “FLIER” – valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: R, N, E (each exactly once).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, T, S, D, F, L.

Positions ruled out for each of R, N, E:

R:
- 2 (CRANE)
- 1 (RENTS)
- 5 (DINER)
- 5 (FLIER)

N:
- 4 (CRANE)
- 3 (RENTS)
- 3 (DINER)

E:
- 5 (CRANE)
- 2 (RENTS)
- 4 (DINER)
- 4 (FLIER)

Thus, the remaining legal positions are:

R: 3, 4
N: 1, 2, 5
E: 1, 3

We still need two more distinct letters, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding C, A, T, S, D, F, L, and excluding R, N, E.  
Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word that contains R, N, E once each plus two distinct new letters from the available set, and respects the positional restrictions.

Let’s pick two new letters: B and G.

We must place R, N, E, B, G so that:
- R is in 3 or 4
- N is in 1, 2, or 5
- E is in 1 or 3

Try positions:

Option 1:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or A.
- Contains R, N, E, but each in a different position than before.

Known letters: R, N, E (all must appear once).
Known positions:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be (originally) in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, N, E plus two other letters (not C or A), with the positional constraints above.

Possible candidates:
- R, N, E must be placed in new positions.
- Let’s try to place R in positions 1,3,4,5; N in positions 1,2,3,5; E in positions 1,2,3,4.

A word that satisfies these: ""RENTS"" (R,E,N,T,S).
Check:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- N in position 3 (allowed).
- T and S are new letters (not C or A).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: C, A
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, N, E

2. RENTS → R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T, S
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, E, N

So far we know the secret word must contain exactly the letters {R, N, E} plus two more letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not C, A, T, S).

Positions ruled out:
- R: cannot be 2 (from CRANE) or 1 (from RENTS)
- E: cannot be 5 (from CRANE) or 2 (from RENTS)
- N: cannot be 4 (from CRANE) or 3 (from RENTS)

Remaining possible positions:
- R: 3, 4, 5
- E: 1, 3, 4
- N: 1, 2, 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, N, E once each and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding C, A, T, S). Let’s pick two common unused letters: D and I.

Possible word: ""DINER""
Check:
- Letters: D, I, N, E, R – uses N, E, R and two new letters.
- Positions:
  - D (new, no restriction)
  - I (new, no restriction)
  - N in position 3 – allowed (only 3 was ruled out for N, but 3 is allowed here)
  - E in position 4 – allowed
  - R in position 5 – allowed

This satisfies all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
Guess 3: DINER -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(-) N(-) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: R, N, E (each appears once).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, T, S, D.

Positions ruled out for each of R, N, E:

R:
- 2 (CRANE)
- 1 (RENTS)
- 5 (DINER)

N:
- 4 (CRANE)
- 3 (RENTS)
- 3 (DINER)

E:
- 5 (CRANE)
- 2 (RENTS)
- 4 (DINER)

So remaining legal positions:

R: 3, 4
N: 1, 2, 5
E: 1, 3

We still need two more letters (not C, A, T, S, D, and distinct from R, N, E).  
Common unused letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Pick two: let’s try B and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, N, E exactly once each.
- Contains B and I exactly once each.
- Meets the positional restrictions above.

Candidate word: “BRINE”
Check positions:
B – new, no restriction  
R – position 2 → but R is forbidden at 2 (from CRANE) ❌  
So BRINE is invalid.

Next candidate: “BIRNR” – invalid (repeats R and not a word).

Try “NERVE” – repeats E and has 5 letters but E already appears once.  
Try “PERKY” – lacks R, N, E.

Let’s systematically build:

We have letters: R, N, E, plus two new ones (say B and I).

Permutations that satisfy the positional constraints:

One valid arrangement:
- Position 1: N (allowed)
- Position 2: I (new, allowed)
- Position 3: E (allowed)
- Position 4: B (new, allowed)
- Position 5: R (allowed)

Word: N I E B R → “NIEBR” – not a valid English word.

Another arrangement:
- 1: B
- 2: N
- 3: E
- 4: R
- 5: I

Word: B N E R I → “BNERI” – invalid.

Another:
- 1: E
- 2: N
- 3: I
- 4: B
- 5: R

Word: E N I B R → “ENIBR” – invalid.

Try with different new letters: G and L.

Valid arrangement:
- 1: N
- 2: G
- 3: E
- 4: R
- 5: L

Word: N G E R L → “NGERL” – invalid.

Try “LARGE” – has A (forbidden).

Try “FLIER” – has I and R, but F is new, L is new.

Check positions:
F – new  
L – new  
I – position 3 (allowed)  
E – position 4 (allowed)  
R – position 5 (allowed)

Word: F L I E R – “FLIER” – valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: F L I E R.

From the four guesses we have:

Letters that are definitely in the word: R, N, E (each appears once).

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: C, A, T, S, D, F, L.

Positions that have been ruled out for each of R, N, E:

R:
- 2 (CRANE)
- 1 (RENTS)
- 5 (DINER)
- 5 (FLIER)

N:
- 4 (CRANE)
- 3 (RENTS)
- 3 (DINER)
- 3 (FLIER)

E:
- 5 (CRANE)
- 2 (RENTS)
- 4 (DINER)
- 4 (FLIER)

So the only remaining legal positions are:

R: 3 or 4  
N: 1, 2, or 5  
E: 1 or 3  

We still need two more letters, chosen from the unused set {B, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y} (excluding C, A, T, S, D, F, L and R, N, E).

To maximize information, pick two common letters that haven’t been used yet: B and G.

We now look for a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, N, E, B, G exactly once each.
- Respects the positional restrictions above.

One valid arrangement satisfying all constraints:

Position 1: N  
Position 2: B  
Position 3: E  
Position 4: R  
Position 5: G  

Word formed: N B E R G → “NB ERG” – not valid.

Another arrangement:

Position 1: E  
Position 2: N  
Position 3: B  
Position 4: R  
Position 5: G  

Word: E N B R G → “ENBRG” – invalid.

Try:

Position 1: N  
Position 2: G  
Position 3: E  
Position 4: B  
Position 5: R  

Word: N G E B R → “NGEBR” – invalid.

Try swapping B and G:

Position 1: N  
Position 2: B  
Position 3: E  
Position 4: G  
Position 5: R  

Word: N B E G R → “NBEGR” – invalid.

Let’s try a different set of new letters: H and I.

Valid arrangement:

Position 1: N  
Position 2: H  
Position 3: E  
Position 4: R  
Position 5: I  

Word: N H E R I → “NHERI” – invalid.

Another arrangement:

Position 1: E  
Position 2: N  
Position 3: H  
Position 4: R  
Position 5: I  

Word: E N H R I → “ENHRI” – invalid.

Try:

Position 1: N  
Position 2: I  
Position 3: E  
Position 4: H  
Position 5: R  

Word: N I E H R → “NIEHR” – invalid.

Try with letters B and I:

Position 1: N  
Position 2: I  
Position 3: B  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: R  

Word: N I B E R → “NIBER” – invalid.

Try:

Position 1: B  
Position 2: N  
Position 3: I  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: R  

Word: B N I E R → “BNIER” – invalid.

Try:

Position 1: B  
Position 2: I  
Position 3: N  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: R  

Word: B I N E R → “B I N E R” – valid English word “B I N E R”.

Check constraints:
- Contains R, N, E, plus B and I (both new).  
- Positions:
  – B (pos 1) – allowed  
  – I (pos 2) – allowed  
  – N (pos 3) – allowed (only 3 was ruled out for N in previous guesses, but 3 is allowed here)  
  – E (pos 4) – allowed (only 4 was ruled out for E in previous guesses, but 4 is allowed here)  
  – R (pos 5) – allowed (only 5 was ruled out for R in previous guesses, but 5 is allowed here)

Wait – no, the positional restrictions are strict:

From earlier:
- N cannot be 3 (from RENTS and DINER/FLIER)  
- E cannot be 4 (from DINER and FLIER)  
- R cannot be 5 (from DINER and FLIER)

So:

N must be 1, 2, or 5  
E must be 1 or 3  
R must be 3 or 4  

Let’s list all valid placements:

Case 1: R in 3  
   Then E must be 1 (since 3 is taken by R)  
   N must be 1, 2, or 5 – but 1 is taken by E, so 2 or 5  
   Word pattern: E _ R _ N or E _ R N _  
   Fill remaining two positions with new letters (must be different and not forbidden).  
   Example: E B R N I – but that’s 5 letters: E B R N I → “EBRNI” – invalid.  
   Try: E N R _ _ – but N cannot be 2 here.  

Case 2: R in 4  
   Then E can be 1 or 3  
   If E=1:  
      Pattern: E _ _ R N (N must be 5)  
      Fill middle two positions with new letters.  
      Example: E B I R N → “EBIRN” – invalid.  
   If E=3:  
      Pattern: _ _ E R N (N must be 5)  
      Fill first two positions with new letters.  
      Example: B I E R N → “BIERN” – invalid.  
      Try: H I E R N → “HIERN” – invalid.  
      Try: G I E R N → “GIERN” – invalid.

Try with letters B and G again, but rearrange:

Pattern: _ _ E R N

After exhaustive checking, the only valid English word that fits all constraints is:

N E B R I – but invalid.  
Wait, let’s try “B E N R I” – invalid.

Actually, the correct valid word fitting all constraints is:

“B R E N I” – invalid.

After careful reconsideration, the valid English word that satisfies every positional restriction is:

“B E N R I” – invalid.

Upon deeper reflection, the only valid word is:

“B I N E R” – which is a real word.

Check constraints:
- Letters: B, I, N, E, R – all new except N, E, R.  
- Positions:
  – B (1) – allowed  
  – I (2) – allowed  
  – N (3) – allowed (only 3 was ruled out for N in previous guesses, but 3 is allowed here)  
  – E (4) – allowed (only 4 was ruled out for E in previous guesses, but 4 is allowed here)  
  – R (5) – allowed (only 5 was ruled out for R in previous guesses, but 5 is allowed here)

However, from earlier feedback:
- N was ruled out for position 3 (from RENTS and DINER/FLIER).  
- E was ruled out for position 4 (from DINER and FLIER).  
- R was ruled out for position 5 (from DINER and FLIER).

Therefore, “B I N E R” is invalid because it places N in 3, E in 4, and R in 5 – all disallowed.

Next possible valid word: “G I N E R” – same issue.

“H I N E R” – same.

“M I N E R” – same.

“P I N E R” – same.

“V I N E R” – same.
