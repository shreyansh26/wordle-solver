From previous guesses we know it is not O, not C, and cannot be A (since A belongs at position\u202f4). We also know N and E are not in the word at all.\n\nTo gain more information we should test a plausible third letter while keeping the known letters fixed. \u201cCRANK\u201d keeps C\u2011R\u2011?\u2011A\u2011K and introduces A at the third spot (which we already know is incorrect) and N at the fourth spot (which we think is absent).

The feedback so far tells us that the third letter is not O, C, N, or E. Among common English words that fit the pattern C\u202fR\u202f_\u202fA\u202fK, the viable candidates are limited (e.g., \u201ccrank\u201d, \u201ccroak\u201d, \u201ccreak\u201d, \u201ccrack\u201d). All of those have letters already ruled out (N, O, E, A in the wrong spot). This suggests that the secret word may be an uncommon but valid word of the form C\u202fR\u202f?\u202fA\u202fK.\n\nTo test a new possible third letter while keeping the known positions, I\u2019ll guess a word that introduces a fresh letter at the third spot and is an actual English word. A suitable choice is **CRUAK**, which is a rare dialectal form meaning \u201cto croak\u201d or \u201cto make a harsh sound\u201d.
