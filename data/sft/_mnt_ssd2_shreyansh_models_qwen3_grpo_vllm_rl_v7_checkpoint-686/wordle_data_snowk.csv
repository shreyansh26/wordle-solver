For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are all absent from the word.

So the pattern is: S _ _ _ _

We now need 4 more letters that are NOT L, A, T, E. Good remaining common consonants include R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc. Good remaining vowels include I, O, U.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses none of L, A, T, E
- Uses common letters to maximize information

Candidate words:
- SINUS (but has two S’s; might waste a letter)
- SPURN (S, P, U, R, N – all distinct and common)
- SCOUR (S, C, O, U, R – all distinct and common)
- SHOCK (S, H, O, C, K – all distinct and common)

I’ll choose SCOUR because it uses very common letters (S, C, O, U, R) and gives good coverage of remaining vowels and consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are all absent from the word.

So the pattern is: S _ _ _ _

We now need 4 more letters that are NOT L, A, T, E. Good remaining common consonants include R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc. Good remaining vowels include I, O, U.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses none of L, A, T, E
- Uses common letters to maximize information

Candidate words:
- SINUS (but has two S’s; might waste a letter)
- SPURN (S, P, U, R, N – all distinct and common)
- SCOUR (S, C, O, U, R – all distinct and common)
- SHOCK (S, H, O, C, K – all distinct and common)

I’ll choose SCOUR because it uses very common letters (S, C, O, U, R) and gives good coverage of remaining vowels and consonants.

Current information:

2. Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, U, R.
3. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - S at position 1
   - O somewhere (but not at position 3, since SCOUR gave O(✓) but position 3 in SCOUR is U, not O)
   - Actually, in SCOUR, O was at position 3, and feedback was O(✓), meaning O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). So the pattern is now: S _ O _ _

Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, C, U, R.

Remaining common letters to try: N, I, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, H, Y, W, V, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters not in the excluded set. Good candidates:
- Position 2: N, I, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, H, Y, W, V
- Position 4: same set
- Position 5: same set

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting S _ O _ _:
- SINOS (but has S twice, and we don't know if S repeats)
- SONIC (C is excluded)
- SOPPY (P is allowed, but Y is less common)
- SHOWN (H, W, N are allowed)
- SPIKY (K, Y are allowed)
- STONY (T is excluded)
- SNOWY (N, W, Y are allowed)
- SHOCK (C, R excluded)
- SMOKE (K, E is excluded)
- SPOON (P, N are allowed, but double P and double O issues)

Best options seem:
1. SHOWN (S, H, O, W, N) - all letters allowed
2. SNOWY (S, N, O, W, Y) - all letters allowed
3. SPOON (but has double P and double O issues)
4. SHOCK (C, R excluded)

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCOUR -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) O(✓) U(x) R(x)

Current information:
1. Word starts with S (position 1 is fixed).
2. Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, U, R.
3. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - S at position 1
   - O somewhere (but not at position 3, since SCOUR gave O(✓) but position 3 in SCOUR is U, not O)
   - Actually, in SCOUR, O was at position 3, and feedback was O(✓), meaning O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). So the pattern is now: S _ O _ _

Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, C, U, R.

Remaining common letters to try: N, I, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, H, Y, W, V, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters not in the excluded set. Good candidates:
- Position 2: N, I, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, H, Y, W, V
- Position 4: same set
- Position 5: same set

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting S _ O _ _:
- SINOS (but has S twice, and we don't know if S repeats)
- SONIC (C is excluded)
- SOPPY (P is allowed, but Y is less common)
- SHOWN (H, W, N are allowed)
- SPIKY (K, Y are allowed)
- STONY (T is excluded)
- SNOWY (N, W, Y are allowed)
- SHOCK (C, R excluded)
- SMOKE (K, E is excluded)
- SPOON (P, N are allowed, but double P and double O issues)

Best options seem:
1. SHOWN (S, H, O, W, N) - all letters allowed
2. SNOWY (S, N, O, W, Y) - all letters allowed
3. SPOON (but has double P and double O issues)
4. SHOCK (C, R excluded)

I'll go with SHOWN as it uses common letters and gives good coverage.

Current confirmed information:
1. Pattern: S _ O W _  (S at 1, O at 3, W at 4)
2. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, C, U, R, H, N (N is in the word but NOT at position 5)
3. Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, V, Y, etc. (excluding the ruled-out ones)

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. Also, N must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it's in the word but not at 5, it must be at 2).

So the pattern becomes: S N O W _

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word starting with SNOW. The most common ending letters for SNOW are:
- SNOWY
- SNOWS (but S is already used at position 1 and we don't know if S repeats)
- SNOWB (not a word)
- SNOWP (not a word)

The only valid word here is SNOWY.

Let's check:
- S: allowed at position 1
- N: allowed and must be at position 2
- O: allowed at position 3
- W: allowed at position 4
- Y: not ruled out yet

This fits all constraints.

Current confirmed pattern: S N O W _  
Letters ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, U, R, H, Y  
Letters still allowed for position 5: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SNOW and ends with one of the allowed letters.  
The only common English word that fits is SNOWB (a type of snowball), but ""SNOWB"" is not in most standard word lists.  
Another possibility is SNOWS, but it repeats the letter S, which is already at position 1 and we have no evidence of duplicates yet.

Checking standard word lists, the valid 5-letter word starting with SNOW is **SNOWY**, but we've already tried that and Y is ruled out.  
Therefore, there are no remaining standard 5-letter words that fit the pattern S N O W _ with the letters allowed.

This suggests the word must be **SNOWB** (if ""SNOWB"" is accepted), or we may have made an error in assuming no repeats of S. However, given the constraints, **SNOWB** is the only logical choice.

But since SNOWB is not universally recognized, let's reconsider: perhaps S is allowed to repeat. In that case, **SNOWS** is the only other option. Although S has not been explicitly confirmed to repeat, it's possible.

Given the constraints, **SNOWS** is the most plausible remaining guess.
