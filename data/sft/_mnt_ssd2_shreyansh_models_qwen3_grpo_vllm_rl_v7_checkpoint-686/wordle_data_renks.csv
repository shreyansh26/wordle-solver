For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters and can give good information about vowels and consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that must appear: R, S, E  
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already S), so R is in 3 or 4.  
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5), so E is in 1, 2, or 4.

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, I, T, L, U.

So the word looks like:  
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  
?   ?   ?   ?   S  

Possible placements:
- If R is in 3: _ _ R _ S

  - E in 1: E _ R _ S  
  - E in 2: _ E R _ S  
  - E in 4: _ _ R E S  

- If R is in 4: _ _ _ R S  
  Then E must be in 1 or 2 (cannot be 3,4,5).  
  - E in 1: E _ _ R S  
  - E in 2: _ E _ R S  

We need two more letters for the remaining blanks, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the forbidden letters (A, O, I, T, L, U). Remaining common letters: N, D, C, B, G, M, F, H, K, Y, etc.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters and can give good information about vowels and consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: A, O.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, S, E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, S, E.
- Does not contain A or O.
- Places R, S, E in different positions than before.

Possible candidates:
- ""REINS"" – has R, E, S, but E is in position 2 (was 5), S in 4 (was 4 – conflict), so no.
- ""TRIES"" – has R, E, S, but S in 5 (ok), E in 2 (ok), R in 1 (ok). This seems valid.
- ""SERFS"" – has S, E, R, but S in 1 (ok), E in 2 (ok), R in 3 (ok). Also valid.
- ""STEER"" – has S, E, R, but E in 3 (ok), R in 5 (ok), S in 1 (ok). Valid too.

I'll choose ""TRIES"" as it's common and covers the letters well.

Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(x)  → A not in word  
R(-) → R is in word, not in position 2  
O(x) → O not in word  
S(-) → S is in word, not in position 4  
E(-) → E is in word, not in position 5  

Round 2: TRIES  
T(x) → T not in word  
R(-) → R is in word, not in position 1  
I(x) → I not in word  
E(-) → E is in word, not in position 3  
S(✓) → S is in word and in position 5  

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, S, E  
- S is locked in position 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, O, I, T.  

We still need two more letters (positions 1–4) that are not any of A, O, I, T. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, C, B, G, M, etc.  
Vowels left: U, Y (only 5-letter English words usually use U in this context).

Let’s try to place R and E in allowable spots while introducing new common letters.  
A promising pattern: _ _ _ E S (but E can’t be in 3 or 5, so this fails).  
Instead: _ _ R E S would put E in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).  
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, avoiding forbidden ones.  
Good candidates: N, L, D, C, B, G, M, U, Y.

Possible words:  
- N U R E S → “Nures” (not a valid English word).  
- L U R E S → “Lures” (valid).  
- C U R E S → “Cures” (valid).  
- B U R E S → “Bures” (rare).  
- D U R E S → “Dures” (rare).  
- M U R E S → “Mures” (rare).  

The best common word is “LURES”.

  - Contains R, S (fixed at 5)  
  - E is in position 2 (allowed)  
  - R is in position 3 (allowed)  
  - D is a new letter, not forbidden  
  - N is a new letter, not forbidden  
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, I, T, L, U)  
  - Valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be NERDS.

Let’s update what we now know after the four guesses.

Letters that must appear: R, S, E  
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- E is fixed in position 2.  
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, I, T, L, U, D.

So the word pattern is:
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
?   E   ?   ?   S

R must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Possible placements:

1. R _ E _ S
   - R in 1: R E _ _ S (but E is already in 2, so this would duplicate E)
   - Actually, positions are fixed: E is in 2, S in 5, so R must go in 1, 3, or 4.

Correct patterns:
- If R is in 1: R E _ _ S
- If R is in 3: _ E R _ S
- If R is in 4: _ E _ R S

We need two more distinct letters for the remaining blanks, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the forbidden letters (A, O, I, T, L, U, D). Remaining common letters: N, C, B, G, M, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns:

1. R E _ _ S
   - R E N C S → “RENCS” (invalid)
   - R E N G S → “RENGS” (invalid)
   - R E N B S → “RENBS” (invalid)

   - R E H N S → “REHNS” (invalid)
   - R E K N S → “REKNS” (invalid)
   - R E Y N S → “REYNS” (invalid)
   Closest valid: “RENCS” etc. are all invalid.  
   Actually, “RENCS” is not a word.  
   Real word: “RENS” is 4 letters.  
   So no valid 5-letter words starting with R E _ _ S.

   - K E N R S → invalid
   - Y E N R S → invalid
   Real word: “NEGRS” etc. are invalid.  
   Closest valid: “NERKS” already considered.

From above, the valid candidates are: NERBS, NERKS, BERNS.

Check each:
- NERBS: N E R B S  
  - Letters: N, E, R, B, S  
  - All allowed (no forbidden letters)  
  - E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies all constraints  

- NERKS: N E R K S  
  - Letters: N, E, R, K, S  
  - All allowed  
  - E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies all constraints  

- BERNS: B E R N S  
  - Letters: B, E, R, N, S  
  - All allowed  
  - E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies all constraints  

Among these, “NERBS” is the most common word.

Therefore, the next guess should be NERBS.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters and can give good information about vowels and consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: A, O.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, S, E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, S, E.
- Does not contain A or O.
- Places R, S, E in different positions than before.

Possible candidates:
- ""REINS"" – has R, E, S, but E is in position 2 (was 5), S in 4 (was 4 – conflict), so no.
- ""TRIES"" – has R, E, S, but S in 5 (ok), E in 2 (ok), R in 1 (ok). This seems valid.
- ""SERFS"" – has S, E, R, but S in 1 (ok), E in 2 (ok), R in 3 (ok). Also valid.
- ""STEER"" – has S, E, R, but E in 3 (ok), R in 5 (ok), S in 1 (ok). Valid too.

I'll choose ""TRIES"" as it's common and covers the letters well.

Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(x)  → A not in word  
R(-) → R is in word, not in position 2  
O(x) → O not in word  
S(-) → S is in word, not in position 4  
E(-) → E is in word, not in position 5  

Round 2: TRIES  
T(x) → T not in word  
R(-) → R is in word, not in position 1  
I(x) → I not in word  
E(-) → E is in word, not in position 3  
S(✓) → S is in word and in position 5  

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, S, E  
- S is locked in position 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, O, I, T.  

We still need two more letters (positions 1–4) that are not any of A, O, I, T. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, C, B, G, M, etc.  
Vowels left: U, Y (only 5-letter English words usually use U in this context).

Let’s try to place R and E in allowable spots while introducing new common letters.  
A promising pattern: _ _ _ E S (but E can’t be in 3 or 5, so this fails).  
Instead: _ _ R E S would put E in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).  
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, avoiding forbidden ones.  
Good candidates: N, L, D, C, B, G, M, U, Y.

Possible words:  
- N U R E S → “Nures” (not a valid English word).  
- L U R E S → “Lures” (valid).  
- C U R E S → “Cures” (valid).  
- B U R E S → “Bures” (rare).  
- D U R E S → “Dures” (rare).  
- M U R E S → “Mures” (rare).  

The best common word is “LURES”.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that must appear: R, S, E  
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already S), so R is in 3 or 4.  
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5), so E is in 1, 2, or 4.

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, I, T, L, U.

So the word looks like:  
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  
?   ?   ?   ?   S  

Possible placements:
- If R is in 3: _ _ R _ S  
  Then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
  - E in 1: E _ R _ S  
  - E in 2: _ E R _ S  
  - E in 4: _ _ R E S  

- If R is in 4: _ _ _ R S  
  Then E must be in 1 or 2 (cannot be 3,4,5).  
  - E in 1: E _ _ R S  
  - E in 2: _ E _ R S  

We need two more letters for the remaining blanks, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the forbidden letters (A, O, I, T, L, U). Remaining common letters: N, D, C, B, G, M, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Let’s list valid English words that fit these patterns:

1. E _ R _ S  
   - E N R E S → “ENRES” (invalid)  
   - E N R O S → O is forbidden  
   - E N R I S → I is forbidden  
   - E N R U S → U is forbidden  
   - E N R Y S → “ENRYS” (invalid)  
   - E B R A S → A is forbidden

   Closest valid: “ECRES” (but rare).

2. _ E R _ S  
   - N E R V S → invalid  
   - N E R D S → “NERDS” (valid)  
   - D E R N S → invalid

   - H U R E S → U forbidden  
   - M U R E S → U forbidden  
   - G U R E S → U forbidden  
   - Y U R E S → U forbidden  

4. E _ _ R S  
   - E N D R S → invalid  
   - E N C R S → invalid  
   - E N B R S → invalid  
   - E N G R S → invalid  
   - E N M R S → invalid  
   - E N F R S → invalid  
   - E N H R S → invalid  
   - E N K R S → invalid  
   - E N Y R S → invalid  
   - E D N R S → invalid  
   - E C N R S → invalid  
   - E B N R S → invalid  
   - E G N R S → invalid  
   - E M N R S → invalid  
   - E F N R S → invalid  
   - E H N R S → invalid  
   - E K N R S → invalid  
   - E Y N R S → invalid  

5. _ E _ R S  
   - N E D R S → invalid  
   - N E C R S → invalid  
   - N E B R S → invalid  
   - N E G R S → invalid  
   - N E M R S → invalid

   - F E N R S → invalid  
   - H E N R S → invalid  
   - K E N R S → invalid  
   - Y E N R S → invalid  

The most common valid word fitting these constraints is “NERDS”.

Let me verify:  
- N E R D S  
  - Contains R, S (fixed at 5)  
  - E is in position 2 (allowed)  
  - R is in position 3 (allowed)  
  - D is a new letter, not forbidden  
  - N is a new letter, not forbidden  
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, I, T, L, U)  
  - Valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be NERDS.

Let’s update what we now know after the four guesses.

Letters that must appear: R, S, E  
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- E is fixed in position 2.  
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, I, T, L, U, D.

So the word pattern is:
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
?   E   ?   ?   S

R must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Possible placements:

1. R _ E _ S
   - R in 1: R E _ _ S (but E is already in 2, so this would duplicate E)
   - Actually, positions are fixed: E is in 2, S in 5, so R must go in 1, 3, or 4.

Correct patterns:
- If R is in 1: R E _ _ S
- If R is in 3: _ E R _ S
- If R is in 4: _ E _ R S

We need two more distinct letters for the remaining blanks, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the forbidden letters (A, O, I, T, L, U, D). Remaining common letters: N, C, B, G, M, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns:

1. R E _ _ S
   - R E N C S → “RENCS” (invalid)
   - R E N G S → “RENGS” (invalid)
   - R E N B S → “RENBS” (invalid)
   - R E N M S → “RENMS” (invalid)
   - R E N F S → “RENFS” (invalid)
   - R E N H S → “RENHS” (invalid)
   - R E N K S → “RENKS” (invalid)
   - R E N Y S → “RENYS” (invalid)
   - R E C N S → “RECNS” (invalid)
   - R E B N S → “REBNS” (invalid)
   - R E G N S → “REGNS” (invalid)
   - R E M N S → “REMNS” (invalid)
   - R E F N S → “REFNS” (invalid)
   - R E H N S → “REHNS” (invalid)
   - R E K N S → “REKNS” (invalid)
   - R E Y N S → “REYNS” (invalid)
   Closest valid: “RENCS” etc. are all invalid.  
   Actually, “RENCS” is not a word.  
   Real word: “RENS” is 4 letters.  
   So no valid 5-letter words starting with R E _ _ S.

2. _ E R _ S
   - N E R V S → invalid
   - N E R C S → “NERCS” (invalid)
   - N E R B S → “NERBS” (valid)
   - N E R M S → “NERMS” (invalid)
   - N E R F S → “NERFS” (invalid)
   - N E R H S → “NERHS” (invalid)
   - N E R K S → “NERKS” (valid)
   - N E R Y S → “NERYS” (invalid)
   - C E R N S → invalid
   - B E R N S → “BERNS” (valid)
   - G E R N S → invalid
   - M E R N S → invalid
   - F E R N S → invalid
   - H E R N S → invalid
   - K E R N S → invalid
   - Y E R N S → invalid

Valid options: NERBS, NERKS, BERNS.

3. _ E _ R S
   - N E B R S → “NEBRS” (invalid)
   - N E C R S → “NECRS” (invalid)
   - N E G R S → “NEGRS” (invalid)
   - N E M R S → “NEMRS” (invalid)
   - N E F R S → “NEFRS” (invalid)
   - N E H R S → “NEHRS” (invalid)
   - N E K R S → “NEKRS” (invalid)
   - N E Y R S → “NEYRS” (invalid)
   - C E N R S → invalid
   - B E N R S → invalid
   - G E N R S → invalid
   - M E N R S → invalid
   - F E N R S → invalid
   - H E N R S → invalid
   - K E N R S → invalid
   - Y E N R S → invalid
   Real word: “NEGRS” etc. are invalid.  
   Closest valid: “NERKS” already considered.

From above, the valid candidates are: NERBS, NERKS, BERNS.

Check each:
- NERBS: N E R B S  
  - Letters: N, E, R, B, S  
  - All allowed (no forbidden letters)  
  - E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies all constraints  

- NERKS: N E R K S  
  - Letters: N, E, R, K, S  
  - All allowed  
  - E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies all constraints  

- BERNS: B E R N S  
  - Letters: B, E, R, N, S  
  - All allowed  
  - E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies all constraints  

Among these, “NERBS” is the most common word.

Therefore, the next guess should be NERBS.

After five guesses we now know:

- The word has the fixed pattern _ E _ _ S.
- R must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, I, T, L, U, D, B.
- Letters that are still allowed (besides R, E, S): C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have tried N in positions 1 and 2 and received “-”, so N is in the word but not in those positions.  
Therefore N must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: R in 1 → R E N _ S (but N would be in 3, allowed)  
   Pattern: R E N _ S  
   Need one more letter for position 4, chosen from allowed set.  
   Valid English word: R E N C S → “RENCS” (invalid), R E N G S → “RENGS” (invalid), R E N K S → “RENKS” (invalid), R E N M S → “RENMS” (invalid), R E N F S → “RENFS” (invalid), R E N H S → “RENHS” (invalid), R E N Y S → “RENYS” (invalid).  
   No valid 5-letter word starts R E N _ S.

Case 2: R in 3 → _ E R _ S  
   Pattern: _ E R _ S  
   N must be in 4: _ E R N S  
   Need a letter for position 1.  
   Valid word: F E R N S → “FERNS” (valid).

Case 3: R in 4 → _ E _ R S  
   Pattern: _ E _ R S  
   N must be in 3: _ E N R S  
   Need a letter for position 1.  
   Valid word: F E N R S → “FENRS” (invalid), C E N R S → “CENRS” (invalid), B E N R S → “BENRS” (invalid), G E N R S → “GENRS” (invalid), M E N R S → “MENRS” (invalid), H E N R S → “HENRS” (invalid), K E N R S → “KENRS” (invalid), Y E N R S → “YENRS” (invalid).  
   No valid 5-letter word fits _ E N R S.

Therefore the only valid candidate left is FERNS.

Check constraints:
- F, E, R, N, S – all allowed letters.  
- E in 2, S in 5, R in 3 – satisfies feedback.  
- N is in 4 (not 1 or 2) – satisfies feedback.  
- No forbidden letters present.

So the next guess must be FERNS.
