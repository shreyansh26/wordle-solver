### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants. However, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: G R I _ _
2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, N, D, F
3. Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because feedback for T was “-”).

Therefore T must occupy position 4.

So the word is: G R I T _

Letters still allowed for position 5: any except A, O, S, E, N, D, F.

Common remaining letters: B, C, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching G R I T _. The most common candidate is:

- G R I T _ → “GRIT” is only 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with “GRIT”.
- “GRITZ” (but Z is uncommon and not ruled out).
- “GRITY” (Y is allowed).

“GRITY” is a valid English word (meaning “relating to grit” or “showing grit”).

Let me double-check: no forbidden letters, T is in position 4, and Y is allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is GRIT Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants. However, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).

So the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

Now I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Does not contain A, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"" but that has U and might be less common. ""BRICK"" is another option but has C and K. ""FRUIT"" uses I and U. ""DRIP"" is too short. ""GRIND"" uses I, N, D. 

""GRIND"" seems good: G, R, I, N, D. No A, O, S, E. R in correct position. Uses common letters.

Guess 2: GRIND -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 2.

2. GRIND → G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) D(x)
   - G is correct in position 1.
   - R is confirmed again in position 2.
   - I is correct in position 3.
   - N and D are not in the word.

So far we know the word looks like: G R I _ _

Letters still allowed: any except A, O, S, E, N, D.

Remaining common letters: T, L, C, P, M, H, B, F, Y, W, K, U.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The most common endings after “GRI” are “FT” (as in “GRIFT”), “VE” (but E is out), “LL” (GRI LL), “PE” (P is ok, but E is out), etc.

Possible candidates:
- GRIFT (uses F, T)
- GRIPE (E is out)
- GRIAL (but A is out)
- GRIKY (Y is uncommon)
- GRIOT (O is out)
- GRIPE (E out)
- GRIFT seems the best: F and T are common and not yet ruled out.

From the feedback so far:

- Pattern: G R I T _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, N, D, F, Y
- Letters already placed correctly: G, R, I, T in positions 1-4.

The only remaining position is the 5th letter.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with “GRIT” and ends with one of these letters.  
The only common English word fitting this is “GRITB” (invalid), “GRITC” (invalid), … until we reach:

- **GRIT** + **H**  → **GRITH**  (archaic but valid; Scots spelling of “grith” = a narrow lane)
- **GRIT** + **L**  → **GRITL**  (invalid)
- **GRIT** + **M**  → **GRITM**  (invalid)
