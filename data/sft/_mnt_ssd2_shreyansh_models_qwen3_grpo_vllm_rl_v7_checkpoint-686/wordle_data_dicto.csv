For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ Additional letters ruled out: P, N  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ Letters I and T are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Must contain: O, I, T  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N  
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.

Available letters (besides O, I, T):  
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: U (since A, E are out and O, I are in)

We need a 5-letter word using O, I, T and one or two other allowed consonants, with the positional constraints above.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not 2,3)  
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3)  
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A promising pattern: T _ O I _  or  I T O _ _  etc.

Testing T I O _ _: needs two more letters, but we only have 5 total.  
Let’s try T I O _ with one more letter: T I O _ → TIOL_? Not valid.  
Try T O I _ _ : T O I _ _ → TOIL_? Need a valid 5-letter word.

“TOILY” is a valid word (a small chamber or closet).  
Check constraints:
- Letters: T, O, I, L, Y  
- All letters are allowed (no A,R,S,E,P,N)  
- O is in position 2 → but feedback says O is NOT in position 2.  
  (From POINT feedback: O(-) means O not in position 2.)  
So “TOILY” is invalid because of O in position 2.

Next try: O in position 1.  
O _ _ _ _ with I and T somewhere.  
Need consonants from allowed set.  
Let’s try O T I _ _ → OTI__?  
“OTICH” isn’t a word.  
“OTILU” isn’t valid.  

Try O _ T _ _ : O _ T _ _  
“OUTLY” is valid.  
Check letters: O, U, T, L, Y  
- Contains O, T, I? No I. Must include I.  
So invalid.

We must include I, T, O.  
Let’s try I T _ _ O (O in position 5)  
Need two consonants.  
“ITCOM” – invalid letters.  
“ITBAG” – invalid.  

Try I _ T _ O  
“IMBOT” – invalid.  
“ILTRO” – invalid.  

Try _ I T O _  
“MITHO” – invalid.  
“BITOU” – invalid.  

Try _ _ I T O  
“COITO” – valid word (though rare, it’s a medical term for coitus).  
Check letters: C, O, I, T, O  
- Letters: C (allowed), O, I, T (all allowed)  
- O in position 4 (allowed)  
- I in position 3 → but feedback says I is not in position 3.  
So invalid.

Try I in position 2:  
_ I _ _ _ with O and T.  
“CITOL” – invalid.  
“MITOL” – invalid.  

Try O in position 4:  
_ _ _ O _ with I and T.  
“TITOU” – invalid.  
“CITOU” – invalid.  

Try O in position 5:  
_ _ _ _ O with I and T.  
“TITIO” – invalid.  
“CITIO” – invalid.  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words containing O, I, T without A,R,S,E,P,N and respecting positions.

Possible word: “TIOLO” – invalid.  
“TOILY” – O in position 2 (invalid).  
“COBIT” – invalid letters.  

Another approach: use only O, I, T plus two allowed consonants.  
Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try “CITOL” – not valid.  
“GUILT” – invalid.  

Wait, we must use O, I, T and two other allowed consonants.

Let’s try “TIGOL” – invalid.  
“TIBOL” – invalid.  

Try “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Let’s try “TULIO” – valid word (a name, also used in some contexts).  
Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- All allowed.  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- I in position 4 (allowed)  
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- U in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  

This seems valid.  
But “TULIO” is a proper noun (name) and may not be accepted in Wordle.  

Next try: “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Try “CITHO” – invalid.  

Another valid word: “TILAK” – but K is allowed, letters: T, I, L, A, K – A is out.  

Try “TILTH” – valid word (a small hill or ridge).  
Letters: T, I, L, T, H  
- Contains T twice, but must have O. So invalid.  

Try “TITIO” – invalid.  

Try “TULIO” again – it’s the only valid one I can find that fits.  
Let’s check constraints again:  
- Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- No A, R, S, E, P, N – correct.  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- U and L are allowed.  

Thus, “TULIO” is a valid guess.  
Wordle accepts proper nouns as answers, so it’s worth trying.

But to be safer, let’s try another: “GUILT” – but it has U and L, but missing O.  

Wait, we must include O.  

Another word: “TULIO” seems the only valid 5-letter word with O, I, T and allowed consonants.  

Thus, I’ll go with “TULIO”.

Letters: T, I, L, T, H  
- Contains T twice, but must have O. So invalid.  

Try “TITIO” – invalid.  

Try “TULIO” again – it’s the only valid one I can find that fits.  
Let’s check constraints again:  
- Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- No A, R, S, E, P, N – correct.  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- U and L are allowed.  

Thus, “TULIO” is a valid guess.  
Wordle accepts proper nouns as answers, so it’s worth trying.

But to be safer, let’s try another: “GUILT” – but it has U and L, but missing O.  

Wait, we must include O.  

Another word: “TULIO” seems the only valid 5-letter word with O, I, T and allowed consonants.  

Thus, I’ll go with “TULIO”.",Guess 3: TULIO -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(x) L(x) I(-) O(✓),FAIL

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but O is not in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Good vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present)

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all still possible
- O is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed)
- Does not contain A, R, S, E

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ Additional letters ruled out: P, N  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ Letters I and T are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Must contain: O, I, T  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N  
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.

Available letters (besides O, I, T):  
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: U (since A, E are out and O, I are in)

We need a 5-letter word using O, I, T and one or two other allowed consonants, with the positional constraints above.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not 2,3)  
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3)  
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A promising pattern: T _ O I _  or  I T O _ _  etc.

Testing T I O _ _: needs two more letters, but we only have 5 total.  
Let’s try T I O _ with one more letter: T I O _ → TIOL_? Not valid.  
Try T O I _ _ : T O I _ _ → TOIL_? Need a valid 5-letter word.

“TOILY” is a valid word (a small chamber or closet).  
Check constraints:
- Letters: T, O, I, L, Y  
- All letters are allowed (no A,R,S,E,P,N)  
- O is in position 2 → but feedback says O is NOT in position 2.  
  (From POINT feedback: O(-) means O not in position 2.)  
So “TOILY” is invalid because of O in position 2.

Next try: O in position 1.  
O _ _ _ _ with I and T somewhere.  
Need consonants from allowed set.  
Let’s try O T I _ _ → OTI__?  
“OTICH” isn’t a word.  
“OTILU” isn’t valid.  

Try O _ T _ _ : O _ T _ _  
“OUTLY” is valid.  
Check letters: O, U, T, L, Y  
- Contains O, T, I? No I. Must include I.  
So invalid.

We must include I, T, O.  
Let’s try I T _ _ O (O in position 5)  
Need two consonants.  
“ITCOM” – invalid letters.  
“ITBAG” – invalid.  

Try I _ T _ O  
“IMBOT” – invalid.  
“ILTRO” – invalid.  

Try _ I T O _  
“MITHO” – invalid.  
“BITOU” – invalid.  

Try _ _ I T O  
“COITO” – valid word (though rare, it’s a medical term for coitus).  
Check letters: C, O, I, T, O  
- Letters: C (allowed), O, I, T (all allowed)  
- O in position 4 (allowed)  
- I in position 3 → but feedback says I is not in position 3.  
So invalid.

Try I in position 2:  
_ I _ _ _ with O and T.  
“CITOL” – invalid.  
“MITOL” – invalid.  

Try O in position 4:  
_ _ _ O _ with I and T.  
“TITOU” – invalid.  
“CITOU” – invalid.  

Try O in position 5:  
_ _ _ _ O with I and T.  
“TITIO” – invalid.  
“CITIO” – invalid.  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words containing O, I, T without A,R,S,E,P,N and respecting positions.

Possible word: “TIOLO” – invalid.  
“TOILY” – O in position 2 (invalid).  
“COBIT” – invalid letters.  

Another approach: use only O, I, T plus two allowed consonants.  
Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try “CITOL” – not valid.  
“GUILT” – invalid.  

Wait, we must use O, I, T and two other allowed consonants.

Let’s try “TIGOL” – invalid.  
“TIBOL” – invalid.  

Try “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Let’s try “TULIO” – valid word (a name, also used in some contexts).  
Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- All allowed.  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- I in position 4 (allowed)  
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- U in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  

This seems valid.  
But “TULIO” is a proper noun (name) and may not be accepted in Wordle.  

Next try: “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Try “CITHO” – invalid.  

Another valid word: “TILAK” – but K is allowed, letters: T, I, L, A, K – A is out.  

Try “TILTH” – valid word (a small hill or ridge).  
Letters: T, I, L, T, H  
- Contains T twice, but must have O. So invalid.  

Try “TITIO” – invalid.  

Try “TULIO” again – it’s the only valid one I can find that fits.  
Let’s check constraints again:  
- Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- No A, R, S, E, P, N – correct.  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- U and L are allowed.  

Thus, “TULIO” is a valid guess.

But to be safer, let’s try another: “GUILT” – but it has U and L, but missing O.

So far the word must contain O, I, T and two other letters from the still-allowed set:

   - O in position 5 (allowed).  
   - I in position 2 (allowed).  
   - T in position 3 (allowed).  
   - C and G are allowed.  
   This is a valid 5-letter word (a petroleum company).  

2. “GOTIT” – invalid.  

“CITGO” seems to fit all constraints.

Check letters: C, I, T, G, O  
- All letters are from allowed set.  
- Contains O, I, T.  
- O in position 5 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (allowed).

   - O in position 5 (allowed).  
   - I in position 2 (allowed).  
   - T in position 3 (allowed).  
   - C and G are allowed.  
   This is a valid 5-letter word (a petroleum company).  

2. “GOTIT” – invalid.  

“CITGO” seems to fit all constraints.

Check letters: C, I, T, G, O  
- All letters are from allowed set.  
- Contains O, I, T.  
- O in position 5 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (allowed).

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but O is not in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Good vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present)

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all still possible
- O is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed)
- Does not contain A, R, S, E

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ Additional letters ruled out: P, N  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ Letters I and T are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Must contain: O, I, T  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N  
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.

Available letters (besides O, I, T):  
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: U (since A, E are out and O, I are in)

We need a 5-letter word using O, I, T and one or two other allowed consonants, with the positional constraints above.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not 2,3)  
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3)  
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A promising pattern: T _ O I _  or  I T O _ _  etc.

Testing T I O _ _: needs two more letters, but we only have 5 total.  
Let’s try T I O _ with one more letter: T I O _ → TIOL_? Not valid.  
Try T O I _ _ : T O I _ _ → TOIL_? Need a valid 5-letter word.

“TOILY” is a valid word (a small chamber or closet).  
Check constraints:
- Letters: T, O, I, L, Y  
- All letters are allowed (no A,R,S,E,P,N)  
- O is in position 2 → but feedback says O is NOT in position 2.  
  (From POINT feedback: O(-) means O not in position 2.)  
So “TOILY” is invalid because of O in position 2.

Next try: O in position 1.  
O _ _ _ _ with I and T somewhere.  
Need consonants from allowed set.  
Let’s try O T I _ _ → OTI__?  
“OTICH” isn’t a word.  
“OTILU” isn’t valid.  

Try O _ T _ _ : O _ T _ _  
“OUTLY” is valid.  
Check letters: O, U, T, L, Y  
- Contains O, T, I? No I. Must include I.  
So invalid.

We must include I, T, O.  
Let’s try I T _ _ O (O in position 5)  
Need two consonants.  
“ITCOM” – invalid letters.  
“ITBAG” – invalid.  

Try I _ T _ O  
“IMBOT” – invalid.  
“ILTRO” – invalid.  

Try _ I T O _  
“MITHO” – invalid.  
“BITOU” – invalid.  

Try _ _ I T O  
“COITO” – valid word (though rare, it’s a medical term for coitus).  
Check letters: C, O, I, T, O  
- Letters: C (allowed), O, I, T (all allowed)  
- O in position 4 (allowed)  
- I in position 3 → but feedback says I is not in position 3.  
So invalid.

Try I in position 2:  
_ I _ _ _ with O and T.  
“CITOL” – invalid.  
“MITOL” – invalid.  

Try O in position 4:  
_ _ _ O _ with I and T.  
“TITOU” – invalid.  
“CITOU” – invalid.  

Try O in position 5:  
_ _ _ _ O with I and T.  
“TITIO” – invalid.  
“CITIO” – invalid.  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words containing O, I, T without A,R,S,E,P,N and respecting positions.

Possible word: “TIOLO” – invalid.  
“TOILY” – O in position 2 (invalid).  
“COBIT” – invalid letters.  

Another approach: use only O, I, T plus two allowed consonants.  
Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try “CITOL” – not valid.  
“GUILT” – invalid.  

Wait, we must use O, I, T and two other allowed consonants.

Let’s try “TIGOL” – invalid.  
“TIBOL” – invalid.  

Try “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Let’s try “TULIO” – valid word (a name, also used in some contexts).  
Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- All allowed.  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- I in position 4 (allowed)  
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- U in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  

This seems valid.  
But “TULIO” is a proper noun (name) and may not be accepted in Wordle.  

Next try: “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Try “CITHO” – invalid.  

Another valid word: “TILAK” – but K is allowed, letters: T, I, L, A, K – A is out.  

Try “TILTH” – valid word (a small hill or ridge).  
Letters: T, I, L, T, H  
- Contains T twice, but must have O. So invalid.  

Try “TITIO” – invalid.  

Try “TULIO” again – it’s the only valid one I can find that fits.  
Let’s check constraints again:  
- Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- No A, R, S, E, P, N – correct.  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- U and L are allowed.  

Thus, “TULIO” is a valid guess.  
Wordle accepts proper nouns as answers, so it’s worth trying.

But to be safer, let’s try another: “GUILT” – but it has U and L, but missing O.  

Wait, we must include O.  

Another word: “TULIO” seems the only valid 5-letter word with O, I, T and allowed consonants.  

Thus, I’ll go with “TULIO”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, N, U, L  
Letters known to be in the word: O, I, T  
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from POINT and AROSE feedback).  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from POINT feedback).  
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TULIO feedback).  

So far the word must contain O, I, T and two other letters from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have five slots and must place O, I, T plus two consonants while respecting the positional bans.

Possible positions for each:
- O: 1, 4, 5  
- I: 1, 2, 4, 5  
- T: 2, 3, 4  

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word with O, I, T and two allowed consonants.

Try O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _  
Need I and T in positions 2,3,4.  
Possible pattern: O I T _ _ → OIT__  
Need two consonants.  
“OITCH” – invalid.  
“OITKY” – invalid.  

Try O in position 4:
_ _ _ O _  
Need I and T in positions 1,2,5 (but T cannot be in 5).  
So T in 2, I in 1 or 5.  
Pattern: I T _ O _ → IT _ O _  
Need one consonant.  
“ITCOM” – invalid letters.  
“ITBAG” – invalid.  

Try O in position 5:
_ _ _ _ O  
Need I and T in positions 1,2,3,4.  
T cannot be in 1 (from TULIO).  
Possible patterns:
- I T _ _ O → IT__O  
  “ITBIO” – invalid.  
  “ITCOO” – invalid.  
- T I _ _ O → T I _ _ O  
  “TIBIO” – invalid.  
  “TICIO” – invalid.  

Try T in position 2:
_ T _ _ _  
Need O and I in positions 1,4,5.  
Possible patterns:
- O T I _ _ → OTI__  
  “OTIBO” – invalid.  
- I T O _ _ → IT O _ _  
  “ITOGG” – invalid.  

Try T in position 3:
_ _ T _ _  
Need O and I in positions 1,2,4,5.  
Possible patterns:
- O _ T I _ → O _ T I _  
  “OVITI” – invalid.  
- I _ T O _ → I _ T O _  
  “IBTOT” – invalid.  

Let’s try concrete valid English words:

1. “CITGO” – but C, I, T, G, O are allowed.  
   - O in position 5 (allowed).  
   - I in position 2 (allowed).  
   - T in position 3 (allowed).  
   - C and G are allowed.  
   This is a valid 5-letter word (a petroleum company).  

2. “GOTIT” – invalid.  

“CITGO” seems to fit all constraints.

Check letters: C, I, T, G, O  
- All letters are from allowed set.  
- Contains O, I, T.  
- O in position 5 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (allowed).  
- T in position 3 (allowed).  

Thus, “CITGO” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, S, E, P, N, U, L, G, C  (from the x’s and the “-” on C in CITGO)

Letters that are definitely in the word:  
I (✓ in position 2), O (✓ in position 5), T (must be present, but not in positions 1, 3, or 5)

So the word has the form:  
_ I _ _ O  
and it must contain T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
But position 2 is already I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.

Allowed consonants left (besides T):  
B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters (since we already have I, T, O).

Case 1: T in position 3  
Word looks like: _ I T _ O

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but O is not in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Good vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present)

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all still possible
- O is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed)
- Does not contain A, R, S, E

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ Additional letters ruled out: P, N  
   ⇒ Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ Letters I and T are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Must contain: O, I, T  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, N  
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.

Available letters (besides O, I, T):  
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: U (since A, E are out and O, I are in)

We need a 5-letter word using O, I, T and one or two other allowed consonants, with the positional constraints above.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not 2,3)  
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3)  
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A promising pattern: T _ O I _  or  I T O _ _  etc.

Testing T I O _ _: needs two more letters, but we only have 5 total.  
Let’s try T I O _ with one more letter: T I O _ → TIOL_? Not valid.  
Try T O I _ _ : T O I _ _ → TOIL_? Need a valid 5-letter word.

“TOILY” is a valid word (a small chamber or closet).  
Check constraints:
- Letters: T, O, I, L, Y  
- All letters are allowed (no A,R,S,E,P,N)  
- O is in position 2 → but feedback says O is NOT in position 2.  
  (From POINT feedback: O(-) means O not in position 2.)  
So “TOILY” is invalid because of O in position 2.

Next try: O in position 1.  
O _ _ _ _ with I and T somewhere.  
Need consonants from allowed set.  
Let’s try O T I _ _ → OTI__?  
“OTICH” isn’t a word.  
“OTILU” isn’t valid.  

Try O _ T _ _ : O _ T _ _  
“OUTLY” is valid.  
Check letters: O, U, T, L, Y  
- Contains O, T, I? No I. Must include I.  
So invalid.

We must include I, T, O.  
Let’s try I T _ _ O (O in position 5)  
Need two consonants.  
“ITCOM” – invalid letters.  
“ITBAG” – invalid.  

Try I _ T _ O  
“IMBOT” – invalid.  
“ILTRO” – invalid.  

Try _ I T O _  
“MITHO” – invalid.  
“BITOU” – invalid.  

Try _ _ I T O  
“COITO” – valid word (though rare, it’s a medical term for coitus).  
Check letters: C, O, I, T, O  
- Letters: C (allowed), O, I, T (all allowed)  
- O in position 4 (allowed)  
- I in position 3 → but feedback says I is not in position 3.  
So invalid.

Try I in position 2:  
_ I _ _ _ with O and T.  
“CITOL” – invalid.  
“MITOL” – invalid.  

Try O in position 4:  
_ _ _ O _ with I and T.  
“TITOU” – invalid.  
“CITOU” – invalid.  

Try O in position 5:  
_ _ _ _ O with I and T.  
“TITIO” – invalid.  
“CITIO” – invalid.  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words containing O, I, T without A,R,S,E,P,N and respecting positions.

Possible word: “TIOLO” – invalid.  
“TOILY” – O in position 2 (invalid).  
“COBIT” – invalid letters.  

Another approach: use only O, I, T plus two allowed consonants.  
Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try “CITOL” – not valid.  
“GUILT” – invalid.  

Wait, we must use O, I, T and two other allowed consonants.

Let’s try “TIGOL” – invalid.  
“TIBOL” – invalid.  

Try “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Let’s try “TULIO” – valid word (a name, also used in some contexts).  
Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- All allowed.  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- I in position 4 (allowed)  
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- U in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  

This seems valid.  
But “TULIO” is a proper noun (name) and may not be accepted in Wordle.  

Next try: “TULIP” – invalid letters.  

Try “CITHO” – invalid.  

Another valid word: “TILAK” – but K is allowed, letters: T, I, L, A, K – A is out.  

Try “TILTH” – valid word (a small hill or ridge).  
Letters: T, I, L, T, H  
- Contains T twice, but must have O. So invalid.  

Try “TITIO” – invalid.  

Try “TULIO” again – it’s the only valid one I can find that fits.  
Let’s check constraints again:  
- Letters: T, U, L, I, O  
- No A, R, S, E, P, N – correct.  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- U and L are allowed.  

Thus, “TULIO” is a valid guess.  
Wordle accepts proper nouns as answers, so it’s worth trying.

But to be safer, let’s try another: “GUILT” – but it has U and L, but missing O.  

Wait, we must include O.  

Another word: “TULIO” seems the only valid 5-letter word with O, I, T and allowed consonants.  

Thus, I’ll go with “TULIO”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, N, U, L

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from POINT and AROSE feedback).  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from POINT feedback).  
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TULIO feedback).  

So far the word must contain O, I, T and two other letters from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have five slots and must place O, I, T plus two consonants while respecting the positional bans.

Possible positions for each:
- O: 1, 4, 5  
- I: 1, 2, 4, 5  
- T: 2, 3, 4  

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word with O, I, T and two allowed consonants.

Try O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _  
Need I and T in positions 2,3,4.  
Possible pattern: O I T _ _ → OIT__  
Need two consonants.  
“OITCH” – invalid.  
“OITKY” – invalid.  

Try O in position 4:
_ _ _ O _  
Need I and T in positions 1,2,5 (but T cannot be in 5).  
So T in 2, I in 1 or 5.  
Pattern: I T _ O _ → IT _ O _  
Need one consonant.  
“ITCOM” – invalid letters.  
“ITBAG” – invalid.  

Try O in position 5:
_ _ _ _ O  
Need I and T in positions 1,2,3,4.  
T cannot be in 1 (from TULIO).  
Possible patterns:
- I T _ _ O → IT__O  
  “ITBIO” – invalid.  
  “ITCOO” – invalid.  
- T I _ _ O → T I _ _ O  
  “TIBIO” – invalid.  
  “TICIO” – invalid.  

Try T in position 2:
_ T _ _ _  
Need O and I in positions 1,4,5.  
Possible patterns:
- O T I _ _ → OTI__  
  “OTIBO” – invalid.  
- I T O _ _ → IT O _ _  
  “ITOGG” – invalid.  

Try T in position 3:
_ _ T _ _  
Need O and I in positions 1,2,4,5.  
Possible patterns:
- O _ T I _ → O _ T I _  
  “OVITI” – invalid.  
- I _ T O _ → I _ T O _  
  “IBTOT” – invalid.  

Let’s try concrete valid English words:

1. “CITGO” – but C, I, T, G, O are allowed.  
   - O in position 5 (allowed).  
   - I in position 2 (allowed).  
   - T in position 3 (allowed).  
   - C and G are allowed.  
   This is a valid 5-letter word (a petroleum company).  

2. “GOTIT” – invalid.  

“CITGO” seems to fit all constraints.

Check letters: C, I, T, G, O  
- All letters are from allowed set.  
- Contains O, I, T.  
- O in position 5 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (allowed).  
- T in position 3 (allowed).

So the word has the form:  
_ I _ _ O  
and it must contain T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
But position 2 is already I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.

Allowed consonants left (besides T):  
B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters (since we already have I, T, O).

Case 1: T in position 3  
Word looks like: _ I T _ O  
Need two consonants for positions 1 and 4.  
Valid 5-letter words with this pattern using allowed letters:  
- BITFO – invalid  
- FITBO – invalid  
- HITDO – invalid  
- MITJO – invalid  
- VITKO – invalid  
- DITMO – invalid  
- KITBO – invalid  
- MITHO – invalid (U is out, H is allowed, but O is already used)  
- DITVO – invalid  
- JITO_ – nothing valid  
- KITTO – valid word (“KITTO” is a name, but “KITTY” has Y)  
- FITZ_ – FITZO? invalid  
- BITTO – invalid  

Case 2: T in position 4  
Word looks like: _ I _ T O  
Need two consonants for positions 1 and 3.  
Valid 5-letter words with this pattern using allowed letters:  
- BITOT – invalid (no such word)  
- FITOT – invalid  
- HITOT – invalid  
- MITOT – invalid  
- DITOT – invalid  
- VITOT – invalid  
- KITTO – same as above  
- DITTO – valid word (“DITTO” means exactly)  
  Letters: D, I, T, T, O  
  - D is allowed  
  - I in position 2 ✓  
  - T in position 4 ✓ (allowed)  
  - O in position 5 ✓  
  - Second T is allowed (repetition not forbidden)  
  - No banned letters  

“DITTO” is a perfectly valid English word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be DITTO.

From the latest feedback on DITTO:

D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)

This tells us:
- D is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- T is NOT in position 3 (the ""-"" on the first T).
- The second T is correct in position 4.
- O is correct in position 5.

So the word must be exactly: D I _ T O, with the blank in position 3.

Letters already used and confirmed: D, I, T, O  
Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, N, U, L, G, C (plus any others that appeared and were marked x)

Allowed letters for position 3: any consonant not yet ruled out and not already used (D, I, T, O are already placed).

Looking at the remaining allowed consonants: B, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form D I _ T O.

Possible candidates:
- D I B T O – ""DIBTO"" – invalid
- D I F T O – ""DIFT O"" – invalid
- D I H T O – ""DIHTO"" – invalid
- D I K T O – ""DIKTO"" – invalid
- D I M T O – ""DIMTO"" – invalid
- D I V T O – ""DIVTO"" – invalid
- D I W T O – ""DIWTO"" – invalid
- D I Y T O – ""DIYTO"" – invalid
- D I Z T O – ""DIZTO"" – invalid

Wait, let's think of actual words. The only common word that fits D I _ T O is ""DITTO"", but we've already tried that. However, since the second T is confirmed in position 4, and we have D I _ T O, the only letter left is position 3.

Looking at the pattern D I _ T O, the only valid English word is ""DITTO"", but we've already used that. This suggests that the word must be ""DITTO"" itself, as it's the only possible word fitting the pattern. However, we've already tried DITTO and the feedback was D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓), which confirms the pattern D I _ T O with the understanding that the first T is not in position 3 (so position 3 must be a different letter). But no other letter forms a valid word.

This indicates that the word must be ""DITTO"", as the feedback shows that positions 1,2,4,5 are exactly D I _ T O, and the only possible letter for position 3 that forms a valid word is T (but T is already in position 4). This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for DITTO:
- D(✓) – position 1 correct
- I(✓) – position 2 correct
- T(-) – first T is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – second T is correct in position 4
- O(✓) – position 5 correct

So the word is D I [not T] T O. The only letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out and not already used (D, I, T, O are used). The valid English word fitting this is ""D I V T O"" – but ""DIVTO"" is not a word.

Looking carefully, the only valid English word that fits D I _ T O is ""DITTO"", but since the first T is not allowed in position 3, and we have no other valid word, this suggests the word must be ""DITTO"" with the understanding that the first T is not in position 3 (which is already satisfied as position 3 is the second letter, which is I, but this seems conflicting).

This indicates that the word must be ""DITTO"" as it's the only possible word, despite the T(-) on the first T. The feedback implies that the word is D I _ T O, and the only valid word is ""DITTO"", so we must guess it again to confirm.

However, since we have the exact pattern D I _ T O with the second T confirmed in position 4, and no other valid word exists, the correct word must be ""DITTO"". Therefore, we should guess it again.

But since we have only 6 guesses and this is the 6th, we must realize that the word is indeed ""DITTO"". The feedback confirms positions 1,2,4,5 and the only possible letter for position 3 is T, but since T is already in position 4, this suggests the word is ""DITTO"".

Thus, the correct word is ""DITTO"".

But no other letter forms a valid word.

This indicates that the word must be ""DITTO"", as the feedback shows that positions 1,2,4,5 are exactly D I _ T O, and the only possible letter for position 3 that forms a valid word is T (but T is already in position 4). This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for DITTO:
- D(✓) – position 1 correct
- I(✓) – position 2 correct
- T(-) – first T is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) – second T is correct in position 4
- O(✓) – position 5 correct

So the word is D I [not T] T O. The only letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out and not already used (D, I, T, O are used). The valid English word fitting this is ""D I V T O"" – but ""DIVTO"" is not a word.

Looking carefully, the only valid English word that fits D I _ T O is ""DITTO"", but since the first T is not allowed in position 3, and we have no other valid word, this suggests the word must be ""DITTO"" with the understanding that the first T is not in position 3 (which is already satisfied as position 3 is the second letter, which is I, but this seems conflicting).

This indicates that the word must be ""DITTO"" as it's the only possible word, despite the T(-) on the first T. The feedback implies that the word is D I _ T O, and the only valid word is ""DITTO"", so we must guess it again to confirm.

However, since we have the exact pattern D I _ T O with the second T confirmed in position 4, and no other valid word exists, the correct word must be ""DITTO"". Therefore, we should guess it again.

But since we have only 6 guesses and this is the 6th, we must realize that the word is indeed ""DITTO"". The feedback confirms positions 1,2,4,5 and the only possible letter for position 3 is T, but since T is already in position 4, this suggests the word is ""DITTO"".

Thus, the correct word is ""DITTO"".",Guess 6: DITTO -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓),FAIL
