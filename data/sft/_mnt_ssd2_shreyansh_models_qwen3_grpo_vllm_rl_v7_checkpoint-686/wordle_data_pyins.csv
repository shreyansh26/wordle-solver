### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This will give me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 and marked “-”).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, U).

A strong candidate is “STING”:
- S is moved to position 1 (✓).
- T, I, N, G are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It avoids all the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
→ S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: STING  
Feedback: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)  
→ S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
→ I is in position 3 and is correct.  
→ N is in position 4 and is correct.  
→ T and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I N _  (positions 3 and 4 locked)
- Must contain S somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, G.

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 5.
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S.

We need S to appear in either position 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s brainstorm possible words matching _ _ I N _ with S in position 2 or 5:

- S _ I N _ → SINUS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know if double-S is allowed)
- _ S I N _ → possible endings: “USIN?” (no 5-letter word), “HSING” (not common), “LSING” (not a word), etc.
- _ _ I N S → possible starts: “BINS?” (BINS is 4 letters), “C”… “C”… “CHINS” (valid 5-letter word)

“CHINS” fits perfectly:
- C _ I N S
- Uses S in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters C and H (both untested).
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

We need two distinct letters from this pool to fill positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “INS”.

Common English words ending in “INS”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This will give me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 and marked “-”).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, U).

A strong candidate is “STING”:
- S is moved to position 1 (✓).
- T, I, N, G are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It avoids all the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

Let’s go with STING.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
→ S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: STING  
Feedback: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)  
→ S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
→ I is in position 3 and is correct.  
→ N is in position 4 and is correct.  
→ T and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I N _  (positions 3 and 4 locked)
- Must contain S somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, G.

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 5.
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S.

We need S to appear in either position 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s brainstorm possible words matching _ _ I N _ with S in position 2 or 5:

- S _ I N _ → SINUS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know if double-S is allowed)
- _ S I N _ → possible endings: “USIN?” (no 5-letter word), “HSING” (not common), “LSING” (not a word), etc.
- _ _ I N S → possible starts: “BINS?” (BINS is 4 letters), “C”… “C”… “CHINS” (valid 5-letter word)

“CHINS” fits perfectly:
- C _ I N S
- Uses S in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters C and H (both untested).
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

Let’s update everything we know after the four guesses.

Ruled-out letters (from any “x” feedback):
A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H, M, U

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- Position 5 = S (✓ from CHINS and MINUS)
- Position 3 = I (✓ from STING and CHINS)
- Position 4 = N (✓ from STING and CHINS)

Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are NOT yet fixed:
- I is NOT in position 3 (from MINUS feedback: I(-))
- N is NOT in position 4 (from MINUS feedback: N(-))

Wait, that seems contradictory to earlier feedback. Let me re-read carefully:

STING feedback: I(✓) N(✓) – so I is correct in position 3, N is correct in position 4.
CHINS feedback: I(✓) N(✓) S(✓) – same.
MINUS feedback: S(✓) – so S is correct in position 5.
But MINUS also shows I(-) and N(-), which means:
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4

This is impossible because earlier feedback said I and N are in positions 3 and 4. The only consistent reading is that the “-” indicates those letters are NOT in the positions shown (i.e., I is NOT in position 3, N is NOT in position 4), which would override the earlier “✓”. But that contradicts the rules: once a letter is marked ✓ for a position, it should remain fixed.

The only consistent way to read this is that the feedback for MINUS is:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so must be elsewhere)
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so must be elsewhere)
- M(x) – M is not in the word
- U(x) – U is not in the word

This creates a contradiction with earlier feedback. The correct interpretation must be that the “✓” in CHINS for I, N, S means those positions are locked, and the “-” in MINUS for I, N means something else. But according to the feedback rules, once a letter is ✓, it stays ✓. The “-” in MINUS must therefore be indicating that I and N are present but in different positions than guessed, which cannot be because positions 3 and 4 were already locked by ✓.

This suggests the feedback for MINUS is being interpreted incorrectly. Re-reading the feedback rules: the symbols are per-letter, not per-position. So for MINUS:

M(x) – M is not in the word
I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2 (since I was in position 2 in MINUS)
N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3 (since N was in position 3 in MINUS)
U(x) – U is not in the word
S(✓) – S is correct in position 5

But positions 3 and 4 were already locked by CHINS, so N cannot be in position 3. This implies the earlier ✓ for N in position 4 from STING and CHINS must be correct, and the “-” for N in MINUS is simply confirming N is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent).

So current locked positions:
- Position 5 = S
- Position 4 = N
- Position 3 = I

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “I N S”.

The only common English word matching _ _ I N S is “FINES” (but ends in ES), “WINES” (ends in ES), etc. Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N S.

Valid 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:
- “B” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “BUINS” (not a word)
- “D” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “DUINS” (not a word)
- “F” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “F” + “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “FLINS” (not a word)
- “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “LIINS” (not a word)
- “P” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “PIINS” (not a word)
- “V” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “VIINS” (not a word)

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:
- “BUNIS” (not a word)
- “FUNIS” (not a word)
- “LUNIS” (not a word)
- “MINUS” (already used, ruled out M and U)
- “PUNIS” (not a word)
- “RUNIS” (not a word)

Actually, there are no standard 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”. This suggests the word must be “FINES” or similar, but we have locked I in position 3 and N in position 4. The only possible word is “FINES” (F I N E S), but E is ruled out.

Rechecking ruled-out letters: E was ruled out by AROSE feedback (E(x)).

So positions 1 and 2 must be filled with allowed letters, and the word must be _ _ I N S. The only possible valid word is “FINES” but E is out, and “WINES” also has E out.

This indicates the word must be “LINES” (L I N E S), but E is out.

“MINUS” is the only remaining candidate, but M and U are ruled out.

“PINUS” is 5 letters but has U (ruled out) and is a proper noun.

“DINOS” has O (ruled out).

“FINIS” has I in position 4, but N is locked in position 4.

“VIRIN” is not a word.

“FILIN” is not a word.

“KININ” is not a word.

“LUNIS” is not a word.

“PILIN” is not a word.

“ZINIS” is not a word.

“FILIN” is not a word.

“GILIN” – G is ruled out.

“HILIN” – H is ruled out.

“JILIN” – J is allowed, but “JILIN” is not a standard English word.

“KILIN” – K is allowed, but “KILIN” is not standard.

“LILIN” – L is allowed, but “LILIN” is not standard.

“NILIN” – N is locked in position 4.

“QILIN” – Q is allowed, but “QILIN” is not standard.

“RILIN” – R is ruled out.

“SILIN” – S is locked in position 5.

“TILIN” – T is ruled out.

“VILIN” – V is allowed, but “VILIN” is not standard.

“WILIN” – W is allowed, but “WILIN” is not standard.

“XILIN” – X is allowed, but “XILIN” is not standard.

“YILIN” – Y is allowed, but “YILIN” is not standard.

“ZILIN” – Z is allowed, but “ZILIN” is not standard.

This suggests the only possible remaining word is “FINIS”, but it has I in position 4 which conflicts with N being locked in position 4.

Rechecking: positions are 1 2 3 4 5.

We have:
- Position 3 = I
- Position 4 = N
- Position 5 = S

So the word must be _ _ I N S.

The only valid English word matching this is “FINES” (but E is out), “WINES” (E out), “LINER” (E out), etc.

This indicates the word must be “FINIS” (F I N I S), but position 4 is N, so this would be F I N I S, which has I in position 3 and N in position 4, and S in position 5. “FINIS” is a valid English word meaning “ended” or “concluded”.

Let’s check if F and I are allowed:
- F is not yet ruled out.
- I is allowed (only positions 3 and 2 are open).

Thus, the only remaining candidate is “FINIS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This will give me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 and marked “-”).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, U).

A strong candidate is “STING”:
- S is moved to position 1 (✓).
- T, I, N, G are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It avoids all the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

Let’s go with STING.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
→ S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: STING  
Feedback: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)  
→ S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
→ I is in position 3 and is correct.  
→ N is in position 4 and is correct.  
→ T and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I N _  (positions 3 and 4 locked)
- Must contain S somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, G.

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 5.
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S.

We need S to appear in either position 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s brainstorm possible words matching _ _ I N _ with S in position 2 or 5:

- S _ I N _ → SINUS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know if double-S is allowed)
- _ S I N _ → possible endings: “USIN?” (no 5-letter word), “HSING” (not common), “LSING” (not a word), etc.
- _ _ I N S → possible starts: “BINS?” (BINS is 4 letters), “C”… “C”… “CHINS” (valid 5-letter word)

“CHINS” fits perfectly:
- C _ I N S
- Uses S in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters C and H (both untested).
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)
Guess 3: CHINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHINS:
- C and H are NOT in the word (x).
- I, N, S are all in their correct positions (✓).

So the secret word is now fully determined:
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)
- Positions 1 and 2: must be filled with letters that have NOT yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out (from all previous x-feedback):
A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H.

Letters still allowed (and not yet placed):
B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters from this pool to fill positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “INS”.

Common English words ending in “INS”:
- BINS? (only 4 letters)
- D?INS → “D” + “INS” → needs a 5th letter; “D” + “U” + “INS” → “D” “U” “I” “N” “S” → DUISN (not a word)
- F?INS → “F” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “F” + “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → FLINS (not a word)
- L?INS → “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “L” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → LUINS (not a word)
- M?INS → “M” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “M” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → MUINS (not a word)
- P?INS → “P” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “P” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → PUINS (not a word)
- U?INS → “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “U” + “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → ULINS (not a word)
- V?INS → “V” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “V” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → VUINS (not a word)
- W?INS → “W” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “W” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → WUINS (not a word)

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter English words ending in “INS”:
- “BINS” is only 4 letters.
- “DIN” is 3 letters.
- “FIN” is 3 letters.
- “LIN” is 3 letters.
- “MIN” is 3 letters.
- “PIN” is 3 letters.
- “VIN” is 3 letters.

But we need 5-letter words ending in “INS”. Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N S.

Valid 5-letter English words matching _ _ I N S:
- “B” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “BUINS” (not a word)
- “D” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “DUINS” (not a word)
- “F” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “FUINS” (not a word)
- “L” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “LUINS” (not a word)
- “M” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “MUINS” (not a word)
- “P” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “PUINS” (not a word)
- “V” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “VUINS” (not a word)
- “W” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “WUINS” (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the only common 5-letter word ending in “INS” is “CHINS”, which we already used. But we ruled out C and H.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words ending in “INS”:
- “BUNIS” (not a word)
- “FUNIS” (not a word)
- “LUNIS” (not a word)
- “MINUS” (yes! “MINUS” is a valid word)
- “PUNIS” (not a word)
- “RUNIS” (not a word)

“MINUS” fits:
- M _ I N S
- M and U are both still allowed (not ruled out).
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, the secret word must be “MINUS”.

Let’s update everything we know after the four guesses.

Ruled-out letters (from any “x” feedback):
A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H, M, U

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- Position 5 = S (✓ from CHINS and MINUS)
- Position 3 = I (✓ from STING and CHINS)
- Position 4 = N (✓ from STING and CHINS)

Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are NOT yet fixed:
- I is NOT in position 3 (from MINUS feedback: I(-))
- N is NOT in position 4 (from MINUS feedback: N(-))

Wait, that seems contradictory to earlier feedback. Let me re-read carefully:

STING feedback: I(✓) N(✓) – so I is correct in position 3, N is correct in position 4.
CHINS feedback: I(✓) N(✓) S(✓) – same.
MINUS feedback: S(✓) – so S is correct in position 5.
But MINUS also shows I(-) and N(-), which means:
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4

This is impossible because earlier feedback said I and N are in positions 3 and 4. The only consistent reading is that the “-” indicates those letters are NOT in the positions shown (i.e., I is NOT in position 3, N is NOT in position 4), which would override the earlier “✓”. But that contradicts the rules: once a letter is marked ✓ for a position, it should remain fixed.

The only consistent way to read this is that the feedback for MINUS is:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so must be elsewhere)
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so must be elsewhere)
- M(x) – M is not in the word
- U(x) – U is not in the word

This creates a contradiction with earlier feedback. The correct interpretation must be that the “✓” in CHINS for I, N, S means those positions are locked, and the “-” in MINUS for I, N means something else. But according to the feedback rules, once a letter is ✓, it stays ✓. The “-” in MINUS must therefore be indicating that I and N are present but in different positions than guessed, which cannot be because positions 3 and 4 were already locked by ✓.

This suggests the feedback for MINUS is being interpreted incorrectly. Re-reading the feedback rules: the symbols are per-letter, not per-position. So for MINUS:

M(x) – M is not in the word
I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2 (since I was in position 2 in MINUS)
N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3 (since N was in position 3 in MINUS)
U(x) – U is not in the word
S(✓) – S is correct in position 5

But positions 3 and 4 were already locked by CHINS, so N cannot be in position 3. This implies the earlier ✓ for N in position 4 from STING and CHINS must be correct, and the “-” for N in MINUS is simply confirming N is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent).

So current locked positions:
- Position 5 = S
- Position 4 = N
- Position 3 = I

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “I N S”.

The only common English word matching _ _ I N S is “FINES” (but ends in ES), “WINES” (ends in ES), etc. Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N S.

Valid 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:
- “B” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “BUINS” (not a word)
- “D” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “DUINS” (not a word)
- “F” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “F” + “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “FLINS” (not a word)
- “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “LIINS” (not a word)
- “P” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “PIINS” (not a word)
- “V” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “VIINS” (not a word)

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:
- “BUNIS” (not a word)
- “FUNIS” (not a word)
- “LUNIS” (not a word)
- “MINUS” (already used, ruled out M and U)
- “PUNIS” (not a word)
- “RUNIS” (not a word)

Actually, there are no standard 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”. This suggests the word must be “FINES” or similar, but we have locked I in position 3 and N in position 4. The only possible word is “FINES” (F I N E S), but E is ruled out.

Rechecking ruled-out letters: E was ruled out by AROSE feedback (E(x)).

So positions 1 and 2 must be filled with allowed letters, and the word must be _ _ I N S. The only possible valid word is “FINES” but E is out, and “WINES” also has E out.

This indicates the word must be “LINES” (L I N E S), but E is out.

“MINUS” is the only remaining candidate, but M and U are ruled out.

“PINUS” is 5 letters but has U (ruled out) and is a proper noun.

“DINOS” has O (ruled out).

“FINIS” has I in position 4, but N is locked in position 4.

“VIRIN” is not a word.

“FILIN” is not a word.

“KININ” is not a word.

“LUNIS” is not a word.

“PILIN” is not a word.

“ZINIS” is not a word.

“BILIN” is not a word.

“DILIN” is not a word.

“FILIN” is not a word.

“GILIN” – G is ruled out.

“HILIN” – H is ruled out.

“JILIN” – J is allowed, but “JILIN” is not a standard English word.

“KILIN” – K is allowed, but “KILIN” is not standard.

“LILIN” – L is allowed, but “LILIN” is not standard.

“NILIN” – N is locked in position 4.

“QILIN” – Q is allowed, but “QILIN” is not standard.

“RILIN” – R is ruled out.

“SILIN” – S is locked in position 5.

“TILIN” – T is ruled out.

“VILIN” – V is allowed, but “VILIN” is not standard.

“WILIN” – W is allowed, but “WILIN” is not standard.

“XILIN” – X is allowed, but “XILIN” is not standard.

“YILIN” – Y is allowed, but “YILIN” is not standard.

“ZILIN” – Z is allowed, but “ZILIN” is not standard.

This suggests the only possible remaining word is “FINIS”, but it has I in position 4 which conflicts with N being locked in position 4.

Rechecking: positions are 1 2 3 4 5.

We have:
- Position 3 = I
- Position 4 = N
- Position 5 = S

So the word must be _ _ I N S.

The only valid English word matching this is “FINES” (but E is out), “WINES” (E out), “LINER” (E out), etc.

This indicates the word must be “FINIS” (F I N I S), but position 4 is N, so this would be F I N I S, which has I in position 3 and N in position 4, and S in position 5. “FINIS” is a valid English word meaning “ended” or “concluded”.

Let’s check if F and I are allowed:
- F is not yet ruled out.
- I is allowed (only positions 3 and 2 are open).

Thus, the only remaining candidate is “FINIS”.

This implies the earlier ✓ for N in position 4 from STING and CHINS must be correct, and the “-” for N in MINUS is simply confirming N is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent).\n\nSo current locked positions:\n- Position 5 = S\n- Position 4 = N\n- Position 3 = I\n\nLetters still allowed (not yet ruled out):\nB, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need two letters for positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “I N S”.\n\nThe only common English word matching _ _ I N S is “FINES” (but ends in ES), “WINES” (ends in ES), etc. Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N S.\n\nValid 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:\n- “B” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “BUINS” (not a word)\n- “D” + “U” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “DUINS” (not a word)\n- “F” + “I” + “N” + “S” → needs a 5th letter; “F” + “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “FLINS” (not a word)\n- “L” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “LIINS” (not a word)\n- “P” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “PIINS” (not a word)\n- “V” + “I” + “N” + “S” → “VIINS” (not a word)\n\nWait, let’s list actual 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:\n- “BUNIS” (not a word)\n- “FUNIS” (not a word)\n- “LUNIS” (not a word)\n- “MINUS” (already used, ruled out M and U)\n- “PUNIS” (not a word)\n- “RUNIS” (not a word)\n\nActually, there are no standard 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

1. Ruled-out letters (from any “x” feedback):
   A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H, M, U, F

2. Locked positions (from “✓” feedback):
   - Position 5 = S
   - Position 3 = I  (from STING, CHINS)
   - Position 4 = N  (from STING, CHINS)

3. Additional positional info from “-” feedback:
   - I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from MINUS and FINIS).
   - N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from MINUS and FINIS).

   However, positions 3 and 4 are already locked as I and N respectively, so these “-” marks are consistent and do not change the locked assignments.

4. Therefore the word pattern is:
   _ _ I N S

5. Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
   B, D, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. We need two distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “I N S”.

7. Valid 5-letter English words ending in “I N S”:
   - “BUNIS” – invalid
   - “DUNIS” – invalid
   - “FUNIS” – F is ruled out
   - “LUNIS” – invalid
   - “PUNIS” – invalid
   - “RUNIS” – invalid
   - “SUNIS” – invalid
   - “TUNIS” – T is ruled out
   - “VUNIS” – invalid
   - “WUNIS” – invalid
   - “ZUNIS” – invalid
   - “JUNIS” – invalid
   - “KUNIS” – invalid
   - “LINUS” – proper noun, usually not accepted
   - “QUINIS” – invalid
   - “VINIS” – invalid
   - “WUNIS” – invalid
   - “XUNIS” – invalid
   - “YUNIS” – invalid
   - “ZUNIS” – invalid

   The only remaining valid English word is “LINUS”, but it is generally considered a proper noun (a person’s name). In standard Wordle/Word-guessing rules, proper nouns are usually not accepted.

   Re-examining, the only other possible valid word is “DINIS” (D I N I S), but position 3 must be I, and position 4 must be N, making it D I N I S. However, this has I in position 3 and N in position 4, and S in position 5, which matches the pattern _ _ I N S. “DINIS” is a valid English word (plural of “dina” in some contexts, though rare).

   Checking if D is allowed: D has not been ruled out.

   Therefore, “DINIS” is the only remaining valid candidate.

   However, let me double-check if there are any other valid words:
   - “BINIS” – invalid
   - “PINIS” – invalid
   - “VINIS” – invalid
   - “KINIS” – invalid
   - “JINIS” – invalid
   - “LINIS” – invalid
   - “ZINIS” – invalid
   - “QINIS” – invalid
   - “XINIS” – invalid
   - “YINIS” – invalid

   Thus, “DINIS” appears to be the only valid remaining word.

   But wait: “DINIS” has I in position 3 and N in position 4, which matches our locked pattern, and D is allowed.

   Therefore, the correct guess is “DINIS”.
