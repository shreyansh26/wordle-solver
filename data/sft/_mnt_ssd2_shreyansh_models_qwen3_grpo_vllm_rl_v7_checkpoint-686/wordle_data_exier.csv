For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and no repeats, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in the word and already in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has an I in position 3.
- It contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps I in position 3.
- Uses R and E in different positions.
- Avoids A and S.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidate letters left: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word like “TREND” would test R in position 2 (but we know R isn’t in position 2), so that’s bad.  
“CRIME” would put E in position 5 (forbidden), so that’s bad.  
“DRIER” has R twice and repeats letters unnecessarily.  
“PRIME” puts E in position 5 (forbidden).  
“TRIBE” puts E in position 5 (forbidden).  
“URINE” puts E in position 5 (forbidden).  
“ELDER” has E in position 5 (forbidden).  

Instead, let’s try “TRICE”:
- I stays in position 3 (✓).
- R moves to position 2 (allowed, since we only know R is not in position 2 from ARISE? Wait, no: in ARISE, R was in position 2 and got “-”, so R is NOT in position 2. So TRICE would put R in position 2 again, which is invalid.  

Oops, so R cannot be in position 2. Let’s try “CRUEL”:

- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- C, U, L are new letters.

“ELDER” has E in position 5 (forbidden).  

Instead, let’s try “TRICE”:
- I stays in position 3 (✓).
- R moves to position 2 (allowed, since we only know R is not in position 2 from ARISE? Wait, no: in ARISE, R was in position 2 and got “-”, so R is NOT in position 2. So TRICE would put R in position 2 again, which is invalid.  

Oops, so R cannot be in position 2. Let’s try “CRUEL”:
- I is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- C, U, L are new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

2. The word contains R, E, and I.
3. R is NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from ARISE and CRUEL).
4. E is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from ARISE and CRUEL).
5. Letters definitely absent: A, S, C, U, L.

So the remaining positions for the known letters are:
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, but position 3 is already I, so R must be in 4 or 5.
- E must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need two new letters (from the remaining common set: T, N, O, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.).

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5.

Candidate words:
- E _ I R _  (E1, I3, R4)
- E _ I _ R  (E1, I3, R5)

For the blanks, we want common consonants that haven’t been tested yet. Let’s try “T” and “N”.

“ENIRT” is not a valid word.  
“EPRINT” is 6 letters.  
“ENTRY” has E1, N2, T3, R4, Y5 – but Y hasn’t been tested and is common.  
However, we need to check if all letters are allowed: E, N, T, R, Y – none of these are in the forbidden list (A, S, C, U, L).  
Also, positions:
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R only excluded from 1 and 2).
- I in position 3 (correct).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and no repeats, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in the word and already in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has an I in position 3.
- It contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps I in position 3.
- Uses R and E in different positions.
- Avoids A and S.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidate letters left: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word like “TREND” would test R in position 2 (but we know R isn’t in position 2), so that’s bad.  
“CRIME” would put E in position 5 (forbidden), so that’s bad.  
“DRIER” has R twice and repeats letters unnecessarily.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Known facts:
- Position 3 is I (✓ in every guess).
- The word must contain E, R, and I.
- E is NOT in positions 4, 5 (from CRUEL & ENTRY) and NOT in position 2 (from WEIRD).  
  ⇒ E must be in position 1.
- R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from CRUEL, ENTRY, WEIRD).  
  ⇒ R must be in position 3, but position 3 is already I.  
  This is impossible.  Therefore, our assumption that all three letters E, R, I are simultaneously present must be re-examined.

Re-examining the feedback:
- WEIRD gave I(✓) in position 3, but E(-) and R(-) only indicate those letters are in the word and NOT in the positions tried so far.  
  That means:
  – E is in the word, just not in positions 2, 4, 5.  The only remaining spot is position 1.
  – R is in the word, just not in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  The only remaining spot is position 3, but position 3 is I.  
  This contradiction implies that R cannot be in the word, yet WEIRD showed R(-) which says R is in the word but not in position 4.  The only way this works is if the feedback was mis-read: the “-” means R is in the word but not in that specific position.  So R could still be in position 3, but position 3 is I.  Therefore, no valid placement remains for R.

This suggests an inconsistency in our interpretation.  Let me re-state the feedback rules:

Each letter gets one of three symbols:
1. ✓ – correct letter in correct position.
2. - – correct letter in wrong position.
3. x – letter not in word at all.

From WEIRD:
- W(x) – W not in word.
- E(-) – E is in word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in word and in position 3.
- R(-) – R is in word but not in position 4.
- D(x) – D not in word.

So:
- I is fixed in position 3.
- E is in word, positions allowed: 1, 3 (but 3 is I), 5.  So E must be in 1 or 5.
- R is in word, positions tried: 2 (ARISE), 4 (ENTRY), 4 (WEIRD).  So R cannot be in 2 or 4.  Possible positions: 1, 3 (I), 5.  Thus R must be in 1 or 5.

Possible word structures:
Case 1: E in 1, R in 5 → E _ I _ R
Case 2: E in 5, R in 1 → R _ I _ E

“RIPER” is a valid 5-letter word.  Let’s check constraints:

- I in position 3 (correct).
- P and E are new letters (E in position 5, P in position 4).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and no repeats, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(✓) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in the word and already in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has an I in position 3.
- It contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps I in position 3.
- Uses R and E in different positions.
- Avoids A and S.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidate letters left: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word like “TREND” would test R in position 2 (but we know R isn’t in position 2), so that’s bad.  
“CRIME” would put E in position 5 (forbidden), so that’s bad.  
“DRIER” has R twice and repeats letters unnecessarily.  
“PRIME” puts E in position 5 (forbidden).  
“TRIBE” puts E in position 5 (forbidden).  
“URINE” puts E in position 5 (forbidden).  
“ELDER” has E in position 5 (forbidden).  

Instead, let’s try “TRICE”:
- I stays in position 3 (✓).
- R moves to position 2 (allowed, since we only know R is not in position 2 from ARISE? Wait, no: in ARISE, R was in position 2 and got “-”, so R is NOT in position 2. So TRICE would put R in position 2 again, which is invalid.  

Oops, so R cannot be in position 2. Let’s try “CRUEL”:
- I is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- C, U, L are new letters.

This seems valid and informative.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is I (✓ from both guesses).
2. The word contains R, E, and I.
3. R is NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from ARISE and CRUEL).
4. E is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from ARISE and CRUEL).
5. Letters definitely absent: A, S, C, U, L.

So the remaining positions for the known letters are:
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, but position 3 is already I, so R must be in 4 or 5.
- E must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need two new letters (from the remaining common set: T, N, O, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.).

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5.

Candidate words:
- E _ I R _  (E1, I3, R4)
- E _ I _ R  (E1, I3, R5)

For the blanks, we want common consonants that haven’t been tested yet. Let’s try “T” and “N”.

“ENIRT” is not a valid word.  
“EPRINT” is 6 letters.  
“ENTRY” has E1, N2, T3, R4, Y5 – but Y hasn’t been tested and is common.  
However, we need to check if all letters are allowed: E, N, T, R, Y – none of these are in the forbidden list (A, S, C, U, L).  
Also, positions:
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R only excluded from 1 and 2).
- I in position 3 (correct).
- N and T are new letters.

So “ENTRY” looks like a valid next guess.

From the three rounds we now have:

1. Position 3 is I (✓ from all guesses).
2. The word must contain E, R, and I.
3. E is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from CRUEL and ENTRY).
4. R is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from CRUEL and ENTRY).
5. Letters definitely absent: A, S, C, U, L, N, T, Y.

So:
- I is fixed in position 3.
- E must be in position 1 or 2.
- R must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1,2,4 and 3 is I).

Thus the word structure is:
- If E is in position 1: E _ I _ R
- If E is in position 2: _ E I _ R

We need two new consonants for the remaining blanks. The unused common letters are: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, O, etc.

Let’s try the first structure: E _ I _ R
Possible valid words: E D I M R (invalid), E G I D R (invalid), E D I P R (invalid), E M I D R (invalid)… none seem valid.

Try the second structure: _ E I _ R
Possible valid words:
- D E I C R (C is out)
- B E I T R (T is out)
- F E I N R (N is out)
- G E I D R (invalid)
- H E I D R (invalid)
- M E I D R (invalid)
- P E I D R (invalid)
- B E I D R (invalid)
- D E I G R (invalid)
- F E I R (too short)
- G E I D R (invalid)
- H E I D R (invalid)
- K E I D R (invalid)
- M E I D R (invalid)
- P E I D R (invalid)
- B E I D R (invalid)

- BEGIR (invalid)
- DEIRD (invalid)
- FEIRD (invalid)
- HEIRD (invalid)
- MEIRD (invalid)
- PEIRD (invalid)
- WEIRD – this is valid and uses W (unused), E, I, R, D.

Check constraints:
- W not yet excluded.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- I in position 3 (correct).
- R in position 5 (allowed).
- D is new.

Known facts:
- Position 3 is I (✓ in every guess).
- The word must contain E, R, and I.
- E is NOT in positions 4, 5 (from CRUEL & ENTRY) and NOT in position 2 (from WEIRD).  
  ⇒ E must be in position 1.
- R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from CRUEL, ENTRY, WEIRD).  
  ⇒ R must be in position 3, but position 3 is already I.  
  This is impossible.  Therefore, our assumption that all three letters E, R, I are simultaneously present must be re-examined.

Re-examining the feedback:
- WEIRD gave I(✓) in position 3, but E(-) and R(-) only indicate those letters are in the word and NOT in the positions tried so far.

  – E is in the word, just not in positions 2, 4, 5.  The only remaining spot is position 1.
  – R is in the word, just not in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  The only remaining spot is position 3, but position 3 is I.  
  This contradiction implies that R cannot be in the word, yet WEIRD showed R(-) which says R is in the word but not in position 4.  The only way this works is if the feedback was mis-read: the “-” means R is in the word but not in that specific position.  So R could still be in position 3, but position 3 is I.  Therefore, no valid placement remains for R.

This suggests an inconsistency in our interpretation.  Let me re-state the feedback rules:

Each letter gets one of three symbols:
1. ✓ – correct letter in correct position.
2. - – correct letter in wrong position.
3. x – letter not in word at all.

From WEIRD:
- W(x) – W not in word.
- E(-) – E is in word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in word and in position 3.
- R(-) – R is in word but not in position 4.
- D(x) – D not in word.

So:
- I is fixed in position 3.
- E is in word, positions allowed: 1, 3 (but 3 is I), 5.  So E must be in 1 or 5.
- R is in word, positions tried: 2 (ARISE), 4 (ENTRY), 4 (WEIRD).  So R cannot be in 2 or 4.  Possible positions: 1, 3 (I), 5.  Thus R must be in 1 or 5.

Possible word structures:
Case 1: E in 1, R in 5 → E _ I _ R
Case 2: E in 5, R in 1 → R _ I _ E

Letters used so far that are out: A, S, C, U, L, N, T, Y, W, D.

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, O.

Check Case 1: E _ I _ R
Need two new consonants for positions 2 and 4.  
Valid 5-letter words: E B I M R (invalid), E G I M R (invalid), E M I D R (D out), E M I P R (invalid), E B I P R (invalid), E F I M R (invalid), E G I P R (invalid), E M I G R (valid word: EMIGR? no), E M I K R (invalid), E P I K R (invalid).  
Actually, “EMBIR” is not a valid word.  “EGILR” is not valid.  Seems no common words fit E _ I _ R.

Check Case 2: R _ I _ E
Need two new consonants for positions 2 and 4.  
Valid 5-letter words: R B I M E (invalid), R G I M E (invalid), R M I D E (D out), R M I P E (invalid), R B I P E (invalid), R F I M E (invalid), R G I P E (invalid), R M I G E (invalid), R P I K E (valid word: R I P E ? no), R B I K E (valid word: R B I K E → “RBIKE” not valid).  
Wait, “R I P E” is 4 letters.  Let me list actual words: R _ I _ E.

Valid words:
- R I V E L (L out)
- R I V E R (R repeated, but R is allowed once)
- R I P E R (R repeated)
- R I D G E (D out)
- R I F T E (invalid)
- R I M E S (S out)
- R I P E S (S out)
- R I V E T (T out)
- R I B E R (valid word: RIBER? no)
- R I G E R (RIGER? no)
- R I P E R (RIPER – valid, and R is allowed to repeat?  The feedback does not forbid repeats.)

“RIPER” is a valid 5-letter word.  Let’s check constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R only excluded from 2,4 so far).
- I in position 3 (correct).
- P and E are new letters (E in position 5, P in position 4).
- Letters used: R, I, P, E – none are in the forbidden list.

Thus, the next guess is “RIPER”.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Known positions:
- Position 3: I (✓ from every guess so far).

Known letters:
- E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓ in RIPER).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from CRUEL, ENTRY, WEIRD, RIPER).
- The only remaining spot for R is position 3, but position 3 is I.  
  This is impossible.  Therefore the feedback must be interpreted differently.

Re-examining the feedback rules:
- “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position (not necessarily excluding that position entirely, just that it was not in that specific spot).

From RIPER:
- R(-) in position 1: R is in word, not in position 1.
- I(-) in position 2: I is in word, not in position 2.  But we know I is in position 3 (✓).  This is consistent.
- P(x): P is not in word.
- E(✓) in position 5: E is correct in position 5.
- R(✓) in position 6: Wait, RIPER is only 5 letters.  This must be a typo in the feedback.  The last R in RIPER is in position 5, but the feedback says R(✓) for position 6, which doesn’t exist.  This suggests the feedback for RIPER should be:
  R(-) I(-) P(x) E(✓) R(-)
  i.e., the last R is in position 5 and got (-), meaning R is in word but not in position 5.

Assuming that correction:
From RIPER:
- R(-) in position 1: R not in 1.
- I(-) in position 2: I not in 2 (consistent with I in 3).
- P(x): P not in word.
- E(✓) in position 4: E is correct in position 4.
- R(-) in position 5: R not in 5.

Now we have:
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- R must be in position 2 (only remaining spot: 2, since 1 and 5 are excluded, and 3,4 are taken by I,E).

So the word structure is: _ R I E _

Letters used so far that are out: A, S, C, U, L, N, T, Y, W, D, P.

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, V.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? R I E ? where the first and last letters are from the remaining set.

Valid words:
- B R I E F (B and F are allowed)
- F R I E D (D is out)
- G R I E F (G and F allowed)
- H R I E ? (no common word)
- M R I E ? (no common word)
- V R I E ? (no common word)

Between BRIEF and GRIEF, both fit.  Let’s pick BRIEF.

Check constraints:
- B and F are new letters, not previously tested.
- Structure: B R I E F – positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), F(5).
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R only excluded from 1,5 so far).
- All letters are allowed.

Thus, the next guess is BRIEF.
