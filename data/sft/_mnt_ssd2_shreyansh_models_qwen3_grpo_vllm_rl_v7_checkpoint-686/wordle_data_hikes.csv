2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repetition. 

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is NOT in the word.
- A is NOT in the word.
- T is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 is wrong, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T
- S cannot be in position 1.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We still need to test other common letters like R, O, I, N, C, etc. A good next guess should:
1. Place S and E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- ROSES (but S is repeated, and we don't know if S appears twice)
- SHINE (H is less common)
- SIREN (good mix: S, I, R, E, N)
- CRISP (but P is less common)

""SIREN"" seems strong as it places S in position 1 (but we know S can't be in position 1 from SLATE feedback), so adjust.

Better option: ""SHIRE"" - but H is less common.

Next best: ""RISEN"" - this places S in position 4 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and introduces R, I, N which are all common and untested.

The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repetition. \n\nSome popular and effective first guesses include:\n- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)\n- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong, so it must be in positions 2-5).\n- L is NOT in the word.\n- A is NOT in the word.\n- T is NOT in the word.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 is wrong, so it must be in positions 1-4).\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters in the word: S, E\n- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T\n- S cannot be in position 1.\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nWe still need to test other common letters like R, O, I, N, C, etc. A good next guess should:\n1.

From the three rounds we now have:

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

So the word pattern is: _ I _ E S

Letters already ruled out (x in at least one guess):
L, A, T, R, N, C, V

Letters already confirmed in the word (either ✓ or - feedback):
S (now fixed at position 5), I (fixed at 2), E (fixed at 4)

Letters still untested for positions 1 and 3 include:
B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, W, Y

We need two distinct letters from this pool to fill positions 1 and 3.

Good candidates:
- D and G → DIGES (but ""DIGES"" isn't a valid word)
- H and K → HIKES (valid word)
- M and P → MIPES (but P is at position 3, and ""MIPES"" isn't valid)
- B and D → BIDES (valid word)
- F and G → FIGES (not valid)
- G and H → GIMES (not valid)
- B and G → BIGES (not valid)

Valid options remaining:
- BIDES (B and D in positions 1 and 3)
- HIKES (H and K in positions 1 and 3)

Between these, ""HIKES"" uses H and K, both common consonants, and is a valid English word.
