- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R somewhere other than position 2

- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, L are new letters (not yet tested)
- No A, O, S

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

   - Present letters: R, E
   - R is not in position 2

   - R is not in position 1
   - E is not in position 2
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - B and L are absent

So far we know:
- Word contains: R, E (with E fixed in position 4)
- Word does NOT contain: A, O, S, B, L
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- E is in position 4 (fixed)

Therefore R must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already excluded for E, and we have no restriction yet on R in position 5. However, we need to place R in position 3 or 5, and we need two more distinct letters (not A, O, S, B, L).

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 3 or 5
- Two other letters from the allowed set

Option 1: R in position 3 → _ _ R E _
Option 2: R in position 5 → _ _ _ E R

Let’s pick Option 1: _ _ R E _
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set (excluding A, O, S, B, L). Let’s pick common ones like C and N → C N R E _ → but we need a 5th letter. Wait, that’s 4 letters. We need 5 letters total with E in 4 and R in 3 → positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" comes to mind, but O is excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. ""F R E _"" – no. ""C R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""CRANE"" – A is excluded. ""FROND"" – O is excluded. ""G R E E N"" – has E twice, but we don’t know if E repeats. Also N is allowed.

But let’s try ""CRATE"" – A is excluded. ""FRUIT"" – U, I, T are allowed, but no E in 4.

Wait, let’s focus on E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no, W is allowed, but we need 5 letters. ""W R E _ _"" – but E is in 4, so positions 1,2,5.

Actually, structure is: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- _ _ R E _
- _ _ _ E R

Let’s try ""_ _ R E _"" with allowed letters. Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" has O excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""D R E _"" – but E is in 4, so D _ R E _? No. 

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""_ _ _ E R"" – like ""T I M E R"" – but M, I, T are allowed. ""TIMER"" – has E in 4 and R in 5, and no excluded letters. Let’s check:
- T: new
- I: new

This seems valid. ""TIMER"" is a common word, uses allowed letters, and fits the constraints.

Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" comes to mind, but O is excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. ""F R E _"" – no. ""C R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""CRANE"" – A is excluded. ""FROND"" – O is excluded. ""G R E E N"" – has E twice, but we don’t know if E repeats. Also N is allowed.

But let’s try ""CRATE"" – A is excluded. ""FRUIT"" – U, I, T are allowed, but no E in 4.

Wait, let’s focus on E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no, W is allowed, but we need 5 letters. ""W R E _ _"" – but E is in 4, so positions 1,2,5.

Actually, structure is: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- _ _ R E _
- _ _ _ E R

Let’s try ""_ _ R E _"" with allowed letters. Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" has O excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""D R E _"" – but E is in 4, so D _ R E _? No. 

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""_ _ _ E R"" – like ""T I M E R"" – but M, I, T are allowed. ""TIMER"" – has E in 4 and R in 5, and no excluded letters. Let’s check:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: in 4 (✓)
- R: in 5 (allowed, since R only excluded from 1 and 2)

This seems valid. ""TIMER"" is a common word, uses allowed letters, and fits the constraints.

Current constraints:
- Word has the form: _ _ _ E _
- Letters that must appear: R (only remaining possible positions: 3)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, S, B, L, T, I, M
- Therefore the only remaining letters we can use are: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

So the pattern is: _ _ R E _

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set.

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words matching “_ _ R E _” with no forbidden letters.

- C H R E W – but W is allowed, and no forbidden letters. However, “CHREW” is a bit obscure.
- C R E D _ – no, we need two letters before R.
- F R E S T – S is excluded.
- D R E A M – A and M excluded.
- N E R V E – N, V allowed, but E repeats (we don’t know if E repeats).
- P R E E N – P, N allowed, E repeats.
- C R E P E – C, P allowed, E repeats.

The simplest word without repeating letters seems to be “CHREW” (though it’s a historical spelling of “crew”), or “D R E _” – but we need two letters before R.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ R E _, so let’s list possible combinations:

- C H R E W
- C N R E _ – nothing common.
- D N R E _ – nothing.
- F R E _ – no.
- G R E _ – no.

The most common word fitting _ _ R E _ with allowed letters is “CHREW” (though it’s archaic). A more common word would be “CREPE” – but P is allowed, and E repeats. We don’t know if E repeats.

Another option: “D R E _” – no.

Let’s try “F R E _” – no.

Actually, let’s try “D R E _” – no.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ R E _, so positions 1 and 2 are the only ones we need to fill.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters definitely present: R, E
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R somewhere other than position 2
4. Has E somewhere other than position 5

Let’s look for common 5-letter words meeting these criteria. The word ""REBEL"" comes to mind:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, L are new letters (not yet tested)
- No A, O, S

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

   - R is not in position 2

2. REBEL → R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
   - R is not in position 1
   - E is not in position 2
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - B and L are absent

So far we know:
- Word contains: R, E (with E fixed in position 4)
- Word does NOT contain: A, O, S, B, L
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- E is in position 4 (fixed)

Therefore R must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already excluded for E, and we have no restriction yet on R in position 5. However, we need to place R in position 3 or 5, and we need two more distinct letters (not A, O, S, B, L).

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 3 or 5
- Two other letters from the allowed set

Option 1: R in position 3 → _ _ R E _
Option 2: R in position 5 → _ _ _ E R

Let’s pick Option 1: _ _ R E _
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set (excluding A, O, S, B, L). Let’s pick common ones like C and N → C N R E _ → but we need a 5th letter. Wait, that’s 4 letters. We need 5 letters total with E in 4 and R in 3 → positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" comes to mind, but O is excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. ""F R E _"" – no. ""C R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""CRANE"" – A is excluded. ""FROND"" – O is excluded. ""G R E E N"" – has E twice, but we don’t know if E repeats. Also N is allowed.

But let’s try ""CRATE"" – A is excluded. ""FRUIT"" – U, I, T are allowed, but no E in 4.

Wait, let’s focus on E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no, W is allowed, but we need 5 letters. ""W R E _ _"" – but E is in 4, so positions 1,2,5.

Actually, structure is: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- _ _ R E _
- _ _ _ E R

Let’s try ""_ _ R E _"" with allowed letters. Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" has O excluded. ""D R E _"" – no.

Let’s update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

Previous constraints:
- Word form: _ _ _ E _   (E is fixed in position 4)
- Letters that must appear: R (only possible in position 3, because positions 1,2,5 have been ruled out for R)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, S, B, L, T, I, M, W, K
- Therefore the pattern is: _ _ R E _

Allowed letters left: C, D, F, G, H, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

From Guess 4 (WRECK → W(x) R(-) E(-) C(-) K(x)):
- R is not in position 2 (already known) and now also not in position 3 → so R must be in position 5.
- E is not in position 3 (but we already know it’s in 4).
- C is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern is now: _ _ _ E R

Letters still allowed for positions 1,2,3: C, D, F, G, H, N, P, U, V, Y (and any others not yet excluded).

C must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3 (because it was marked “-” in WRECK, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).

Let’s look for common 5-letter words of the form _ _ _ E R with C in one of the first three positions and no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- C H E E R – but E repeats and we don’t know if E repeats.
- C R E E R – R in position 2 (forbidden).
- C O V E R – O excluded.
- C H U E R – not a word.
- C H R E R – not a word.
- C H A E R – A excluded.
- C H I E R – I excluded.
- C H I P E R – too long.
- C H E E R – again.
- C H U C K – K excluded.
- C H A V E – not ending in ER.
- C H A P E – not ending in ER.

Actually, let’s list all _ _ _ E R words with allowed letters:

Positions 1,2,3 must be from C, D, F, G, H, N, P, U, V, Y.

We need C somewhere in 1,2,3.

Let’s try:

- C H R E R – not valid.
- C H E E R – valid word, but E repeats.
- C H I E R – I excluded.
- C H A E R – A excluded.
- C H I P E R – too long.
- C H U C K – K excluded.
- C H A V E – not ending in ER.

Another approach: look for common _ _ _ E R words avoiding forbidden letters.

“COVER” – O excluded.

“DETER” – T excluded.

“FEVER” – V allowed, E repeats.

“GUESS” – S excluded.

“HUMER” – M excluded.

“PERCH” – C in position 3, but pattern is _ _ _ E R, so “PERER” – not a word.

“CHEER” – valid word, uses C, H, E, E, R. E repeats, but we don’t know if E repeats. It fits the pattern _ _ _ E R with C in position 1.

Let’s check if any letters in CHEER are forbidden:
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- E: allowed (and must appear)
- E: allowed (possible repeat)
- R: allowed and must be in position 5

So “CHEER” is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters definitely present: R, E
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R somewhere other than position 2
4. Has E somewhere other than position 5

Let’s look for common 5-letter words meeting these criteria. The word ""REBEL"" comes to mind:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, L are new letters (not yet tested)
- No A, O, S

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: REBEL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Absent letters: A, O, S
   - Present letters: R, E
   - R is not in position 2
   - E is not in position 5

2. REBEL → R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
   - R is not in position 1
   - E is not in position 2
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - B and L are absent

So far we know:
- Word contains: R, E (with E fixed in position 4)
- Word does NOT contain: A, O, S, B, L
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- E is in position 4 (fixed)

Therefore R must be in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already excluded for E, and we have no restriction yet on R in position 5. However, we need to place R in position 3 or 5, and we need two more distinct letters (not A, O, S, B, L).

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 3 or 5
- Two other letters from the allowed set

Option 1: R in position 3 → _ _ R E _
Option 2: R in position 5 → _ _ _ E R

Let’s pick Option 1: _ _ R E _
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set (excluding A, O, S, B, L). Let’s pick common ones like C and N → C N R E _ → but we need a 5th letter. Wait, that’s 4 letters. We need 5 letters total with E in 4 and R in 3 → positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" comes to mind, but O is excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. ""F R E _"" – no. ""C R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""CRANE"" – A is excluded. ""FROND"" – O is excluded. ""G R E E N"" – has E twice, but we don’t know if E repeats. Also N is allowed.

But let’s try ""CRATE"" – A is excluded. ""FRUIT"" – U, I, T are allowed, but no E in 4.

Wait, let’s focus on E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no, W is allowed, but we need 5 letters. ""W R E _ _"" – but E is in 4, so positions 1,2,5.

Actually, structure is: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with E in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- _ _ R E _
- _ _ _ E R

Let’s try ""_ _ R E _"" with allowed letters. Let’s pick C, H, N, etc. A word like ""CHORE"" has O excluded. ""D R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""D R E _"" – but E is in 4, so D _ R E _? No. 

Let’s try ""W R E _"" – no. 

Let’s try ""_ _ _ E R"" – like ""T I M E R"" – but M, I, T are allowed. ""TIMER"" – has E in 4 and R in 5, and no excluded letters. Let’s check:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: in 4 (✓)
- R: in 5 (allowed, since R only excluded from 1 and 2)

This seems valid. ""TIMER"" is a common word, uses allowed letters, and fits the constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Absent: A, O, S
   – Present: R, E
   – R not in position 2
   – E not in position 5

2. REBEL → R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
   – Absent: B, L
   – E is fixed in position 4
   – R not in position 1

3. TIMER → T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(-)
   – Absent: T, I, M
   – E confirmed in position 4
   – R not in position 5

Current constraints:
- Word has the form: _ _ _ E _
- Letters that must appear: R (only remaining possible positions: 3)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, S, B, L, T, I, M
- Therefore the only remaining letters we can use are: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

So the pattern is: _ _ R E _

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set.

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words matching “_ _ R E _” with no forbidden letters.

- C H R E W – but W is allowed, and no forbidden letters. However, “CHREW” is a bit obscure.
- C R E D _ – no, we need two letters before R.
- F R E S T – S is excluded.
- D R E A M – A and M excluded.
- N E R V E – N, V allowed, but E repeats (we don’t know if E repeats).
- P R E E N – P, N allowed, E repeats.
- C R E P E – C, P allowed, E repeats.

The simplest word without repeating letters seems to be “CHREW” (though it’s a historical spelling of “crew”), or “D R E _” – but we need two letters before R.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ R E _, so let’s list possible combinations:

- C H R E W
- C N R E _ – nothing common.
- D N R E _ – nothing.
- F R E _ – no.
- G R E _ – no.

The most common word fitting _ _ R E _ with allowed letters is “CHREW” (though it’s archaic). A more common word would be “CREPE” – but P is allowed, and E repeats. We don’t know if E repeats.

Another option: “D R E _” – no.

Let’s try “F R E _” – no.

Actually, let’s try “D R E _” – no.

Let me think of common 5-letter words ending in “RE_”:

- “D R E _” – nothing.
- “C R E _” – nothing.
- “G R E _” – nothing.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ R E _, so positions 1 and 2 are the only ones we need to fill.

Let’s try “C H R E W” – though it’s a bit obscure.

Another option: “F R E S T” – S excluded.

“N E R V E” – N, V allowed, but E repeats.

“P R E E N” – P, N allowed, E repeats.

“D R E A M” – A, M excluded.

“C R E D O” – O excluded.

“C R E P E” – C, P allowed, E repeats.

“G R E E N” – N allowed, E repeats.

“W R E C K” – C, K allowed, no repeats.

“W R E C K” is a valid word (to wreck), uses allowed letters, and fits _ _ R E _.

Let me check:
- W: allowed
- R: allowed in position 3
- E: fixed in 4
- C: allowed
- K: allowed

This seems the best option.

Let’s update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

Previous constraints:
- Word form: _ _ _ E _   (E is fixed in position 4)
- Letters that must appear: R (only possible in position 3, because positions 1,2,5 have been ruled out for R)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, S, B, L, T, I, M, W, K
- Therefore the pattern is: _ _ R E _

Allowed letters left: C, D, F, G, H, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

From Guess 4 (WRECK → W(x) R(-) E(-) C(-) K(x)):
- R is not in position 2 (already known) and now also not in position 3 → so R must be in position 5.
- E is not in position 3 (but we already know it’s in 4).
- C is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern is now: _ _ _ E R

Letters still allowed for positions 1,2,3: C, D, F, G, H, N, P, U, V, Y (and any others not yet excluded).

C must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3 (because it was marked “-” in WRECK, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).

Let’s look for common 5-letter words of the form _ _ _ E R with C in one of the first three positions and no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- C H E E R – but E repeats and we don’t know if E repeats.
- C R E E R – R in position 2 (forbidden).
- C O V E R – O excluded.
- C H U E R – not a word.
- C H R E R – not a word.
- C H A E R – A excluded.
- C H I E R – I excluded.
- C H I P E R – too long.
- C H E E R – again.
- C H U C K – K excluded.
- C H A V E – not ending in ER.
- C H A P E – not ending in ER.

Actually, let’s list all _ _ _ E R words with allowed letters:

Positions 1,2,3 must be from C, D, F, G, H, N, P, U, V, Y.

We need C somewhere in 1,2,3.

Let’s try:
- C H U E R – not valid.
- C H R E R – not valid.
- C H E E R – valid word, but E repeats.
- C H I E R – I excluded.
- C H A E R – A excluded.
- C H I P E R – too long.
- C H U C K – K excluded.
- C H A V E – not ending in ER.

Another approach: look for common _ _ _ E R words avoiding forbidden letters.

“COVER” – O excluded.

“DETER” – T excluded.

“FEVER” – V allowed, E repeats.

“GUESS” – S excluded.

“HUMER” – M excluded.

“PERCH” – C in position 3, but pattern is _ _ _ E R, so “PERER” – not a word.

“CHEER” – valid word, uses C, H, E, E, R. E repeats, but we don’t know if E repeats. It fits the pattern _ _ _ E R with C in position 1.

Let’s check if any letters in CHEER are forbidden:
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- E: allowed (and must appear)
- E: allowed (possible repeat)
- R: allowed and must be in position 5

So “CHEER” is a valid guess.

Let’s extract every constraint from the five guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Absent: A, O, S
   – Present: R, E
   – R not in position 2
   – E not in position 5

2. REBEL → R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
   – Absent: B, L
   – E is fixed in position 4
   – R not in position 1

3. TIMER → T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(-)
   – Absent: T, I, M
   – E fixed in position 4
   – R not in position 5

4. WRECK → W(x) R(-) E(-) C(-) K(x)
   – Absent: W, K
   – R not in position 2 (already known) and not in 3 (new)
   – C is in the word but not in position 3

5. CHEER → C(✓) H(x) E(-) E(✓) R(-)
   – C is fixed in position 1
   – E is fixed in position 4
   – R is not in position 5 (already known) and not in 2 (known) and not in 3 (known) → contradiction.

Wait: from (5) we have R(-) in position 5, meaning R is in the word but not in position 5. But from earlier constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → R must be in position 4. But position 4 is already taken by E. This is impossible.

Therefore, the only explanation is that E must appear twice: once in position 4 and once elsewhere. Let’s re-express the constraints with this in mind.

Revised constraints:
- Word form: C _ _ E _   (C fixed in 1, E fixed in 4)
- Letters that must appear: R (must be in one of positions 2 or 3, since 1,4,5 are taken or excluded)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, S, B, L, T, I, M, W, K, H
- Therefore positions 2 and 3 must contain C and R in some order, but C is already in position 1 → impossible.

This suggests our earlier assumption was flawed. Let’s re-examine Guess 5 carefully.

Guess 5: CHEER → C(✓) H(x) E(-) E(✓) R(-)
- C(✓) position 1: correct
- E(-) position 3: E is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) position 4: E is correctly in position 4
- R(-) position 5: R is in the word but not in position 5

So R must be in position 2 or 3.

Current pattern: C _ _ E _
Allowed letters for positions 2,3: from remaining unused letters (excluding all forbidden ones), we have: D, F, G, N, P, U, V, Y, and R must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s list possible words:

If R is in position 2: C R _ E _
   Need two distinct letters for position 3 and 5 from allowed set: D, F, G, N, P, U, V, Y
   Possible: C R O E D – but O excluded
   C R A E D – A excluded
   C R U E D – valid, “CRUED” (archaic past tense of “cruel”)
   C R I E D – I excluded
   C R I E D – I excluded
   C R I E D – I excluded
   C R O E D – O excluded
   C R U E D – seems best, though obscure.

If R is in position 3: C _ R E _
   Need letter for position 2 and 5.
   C H R E D – H excluded
   C U R E D – valid word, uses C, U, R, E, D
   C U R E D: letters are allowed (C, U, R, E, D), fits pattern, and R in 3.

“CURED” is a common word (past tense of cure), and all letters are allowed.

Therefore, CURED is the logical next guess.

<guess>CURED</guess>",CURED,"Let’s extract every constraint from the five guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Absent: A, O, S
   – Present: R, E
   – R not in position 2
   – E not in position 5

2. REBEL → R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)

3. TIMER → T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(-)

   – R not in position 5

4. WRECK → W(x) R(-) E(-) C(-) K(x)
   – Absent: W, K
   – R not in position 2 (already known) and not in 3 (new)
   – C is in the word but not in position 3

5. CHEER → C(✓) H(x) E(-) E(✓) R(-)
   – C is fixed in position 1
   – E is fixed in position 4
   – R is not in position 5 (already known) and not in 2 (known) and not in 3 (known) → contradiction.

Wait: from (5) we have R(-) in position 5, meaning R is in the word but not in position 5. But from earlier constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → R must be in position 4. But position 4 is already taken by E. This is impossible.

Therefore, the only explanation is that E must appear twice: once in position 4 and once elsewhere. Let’s re-express the constraints with this in mind.

Revised constraints:
- Word form: C _ _ E _   (C fixed in 1, E fixed in 4)
- Letters that must appear: R (must be in one of positions 2 or 3, since 1,4,5 are taken or excluded)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, S, B, L, T, I, M, W, K, H
- Therefore positions 2 and 3 must contain C and R in some order, but C is already in position 1 → impossible.

This suggests our earlier assumption was flawed. Let’s re-examine Guess 5 carefully.

Guess 5: CHEER → C(✓) H(x) E(-) E(✓) R(-)
- C(✓) position 1: correct
- E(-) position 3: E is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) position 4: E is correctly in position 4

So R must be in position 2 or 3.

Current pattern: C _ _ E _
Allowed letters for positions 2,3: from remaining unused letters (excluding all forbidden ones), we have: D, F, G, N, P, U, V, Y, and R must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s list possible words:

If R is in position 2: C R _ E _
   Need two distinct letters for position 3 and 5 from allowed set: D, F, G, N, P, U, V, Y
