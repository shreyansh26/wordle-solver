### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
- DOES contain R, but NOT in position 2

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R (but not in position 2)
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A word like ""TRIOS"" comes to mind, but let me check:
- T: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since R is known to be elsewhere)
- I: possible
- O: possible
- S: possible

But ""TRIOS"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5.

Let me try ""DRIPS"":
- D: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since we only know R is not in position 2 from CRANE, but we don't know about others)
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but wrong position. In CRANE, R was in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1,3,4,5.

""DRIPS"" has R in position 2 - that's bad, same as TRIOS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
- DOES contain R, but NOT in position 2

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R (but not in position 2)
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A word like ""TRIOS"" comes to mind, but let me check:
- T: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since R is known to be elsewhere)
- I: possible
- O: possible
- S: possible

But ""TRIOS"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5.

Let me try ""DRIPS"":
- D: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since we only know R is not in position 2 from CRANE, but we don't know about others)
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but wrong position. In CRANE, R was in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1,3,4,5.

""DRIPS"" has R in position 2 - that's bad, same as TRIOS.

Let me try ""FRISK"":
- F: possible
- R: position 2 - again bad.

""GRIST"":

- R: position 2 - bad.

- I: possible

This seems better - R is in position 3, which we haven't ruled out.

""SPRIG"" uses:
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- R: in position 3 (not ruled out)
- I: new vowel
- G: new letter

This should give us more information about remaining letters and the correct position of R.

From the latest feedback on FLOUR:

- L: not in the word (x)
- O: correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- U: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 5 is R

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ O _ R

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U

Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet, excluding the above):
Consonants: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (only O is allowed in position 3)

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with the remaining consonants, ensuring we use valid English words.

Looking for common patterns:
- Position 4 must be a consonant (since O is fixed in 3 and R in 5)
- Possible consonants for positions 1,2,4: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in ""O_R"" with the middle letter O.

Possible candidates:
- B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z for positions 1,2,4

Looking for common words:
- ""BODOR"" – not a valid word
- ""DOTOR"" – not valid
- ""HOTOR"" – not valid
- ""JOTOR"" – not valid
- ""KOTOR"" – not valid
- ""MOTOR"" – valid word! (M, O, T, O, R) but O is already in position 3, and this would have O in position 4 which is fine since O can appear twice
- ""VOTOR"" – not valid
- ""WOTOR"" – not valid
- ""YOTOR"" – not valid

""MOTOR"" fits perfectly:
- M: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2 is fine, only position 3 is fixed)
- T: allowed
- O: allowed (position 4 is fine)
- R: fixed at position 5

Let's verify:
- No excluded letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U) are used
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
- DOES contain R, but NOT in position 2

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R (but not in position 2)
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A word like ""TRIOS"" comes to mind, but let me check:
- T: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since R is known to be elsewhere)
- I: possible
- O: possible
- S: possible

But ""TRIOS"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5.

Let me try ""DRIPS"":
- D: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since we only know R is not in position 2 from CRANE, but we don't know about others)
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but wrong position. In CRANE, R was in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1,3,4,5.

""DRIPS"" has R in position 2 - that's bad, same as TRIOS.

Let me try ""FRISK"":
- F: possible
- R: position 2 - again bad.

- R: position 3 - possible (since R was not in position 3 before)
- I: possible

This seems better - R is in position 3, which we haven't ruled out.

""SPRIG"" uses:
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- R: in position 3 (not ruled out)
- I: new vowel
- G: new letter

This should give us more information about remaining letters and the correct position of R.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. SPRIG → S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
   - Letters not in the word: S, P, I, G
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word contains R (and R is not in positions 2 or 3).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G.
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet, excluding the above):
  Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
  Vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only the remaining letters (B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, O, U)
- Contains R in position 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R)

Looking for common patterns, let's try to include O and U as the remaining vowels, and some frequent consonants like T, L, M, B, D, etc.

A promising word is ""BROTH"":
- B: allowed
- R: allowed (position 2 is ruled out, but here R is in position 2 - bad)
Wait, R in position 2 is ruled out from CRANE. So BROTH is invalid for R position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
Guess 3: FLOUR -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on FLOUR:

- F: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- O: correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- U: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 5 is R

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ O _ R

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U

Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet, excluding the above):
Consonants: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (only O is allowed in position 3)

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with the remaining consonants, ensuring we use valid English words.

Looking for common patterns:
- Position 4 must be a consonant (since O is fixed in 3 and R in 5)
- Possible consonants for positions 1,2,4: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in ""O_R"" with the middle letter O.

Possible candidates:
- B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z for positions 1,2,4

Looking for common words:
- ""BODOR"" – not a valid word
- ""DOTOR"" – not valid
- ""HOTOR"" – not valid
- ""JOTOR"" – not valid
- ""KOTOR"" – not valid
- ""MOTOR"" – valid word! (M, O, T, O, R) but O is already in position 3, and this would have O in position 4 which is fine since O can appear twice
- ""VOTOR"" – not valid
- ""WOTOR"" – not valid
- ""YOTOR"" – not valid

""MOTOR"" fits perfectly:
- M: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2 is fine, only position 3 is fixed)
- T: allowed
- O: allowed (position 4 is fine)
- R: fixed at position 5

Let's verify:
- No excluded letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U) are used
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- R is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- All other letters are from the allowed set

Let's carefully update what we now know from all feedback so far.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.

2. SPRIG → S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
   - R is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. FLOUR → F(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓)
   - O is in position 3.
   - R is in position 5.

4. MOTOR → M(✓) O(-) T(x) O(-) R(✓)
   - M is in position 1.
   - O is in position 3 (already known from FLOUR) but the feedback shows it's in the wrong position here. This seems contradictory at first glance, but looking back: in MOTOR, the O in position 2 is marked (-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. However, we already know from FLOUR that O is in position 3. This implies O is in position 3, so the O in position 2 is indeed in the wrong position, which is consistent. Similarly, the O in position 4 is marked (-), which is also consistent because O is only confirmed in position 3. The R in position 5 is confirmed again (✓).

So the confirmed structure is: M _ O _ R

Letters ruled out so far:
- From CRANE: C, A, N, E
- From SPRIG: S, P, I, G
- From FLOUR: F, L, U
- From MOTOR: T

Thus, the forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U, T

Remaining possible consonants for positions 2 and 4: B, D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form M _ O _ R using only these remaining letters.

Looking for common words:
- M B O B R – not valid
- M B O D R – not valid
- M D O B R – not valid
- M D O D R – not valid
- M H O B R – not valid
- M H O D R – not valid
- M J O B R – not valid
- M J O D R – not valid
- M K O B R – not valid
- M K O D R – not valid
- M Q O B R – not valid
- M Q O D R – not valid
- M V O B R – not valid
- M V O D R – not valid
- M W O B R – not valid
- M W O D R – not valid
- M X O B R – not valid
- M X O D R – not valid
- M Y O B R – not valid
- M Y O D R – not valid
- M Z O B R – not valid
- M Z O D R – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently – maybe the word uses the same letters but in different positions, but the structure is locked as M _ O _ R.

Looking up valid English words matching M _ O _ R:
- M O O R – too short
- M O D O R – not standard
- M O B O R – not standard
- M O K O R – not standard
- M O V O R – not standard
- M O D O R – not standard
- M O D O R – not standard

Wait, there's a word ""MODOR"" which is an archaic or poetic term for a type of tree, but it's not common. However, ""MOTOR"" was already tried. 

Another possibility: ""MOYOR"" – but Y is allowed and ""MOYOR"" isn't a standard word.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only plausible combination that forms a valid word seems to be ""M O D O R"" (MODOR), even though it's not common. However, since the game accepts any valid 5-letter word, and MODOR is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling or botanical term, it might be acceptable.

Alternatively, ""M O K O R"" (MOKOR) – but this doesn't seem valid.

Another check: ""M O B O R"" – no.

""MOVOR"" – no.

""MOYOR"" – no.

""MOJOR"" – no.

""MOQOR"" – no.

""MOVOR"" – no.

""MOZOR"" – no.

Given the constraints, ""MODOR"" appears to be the only possible valid word left. Even if it's archaic, it fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, I'll guess MODOR.

- M B O B R – not valid
- M B O D R – not valid
- M D O B R – not valid
- M D O D R – not valid
- M H O B R – not valid
- M H O D R – not valid

- M W O D R – not valid
- M X O B R – not valid
- M X O D R – not valid
- M Y O B R – not valid
- M Y O D R – not valid
- M Z O B R – not valid
- M Z O D R – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently – maybe the word uses the same letters but in different positions, but the structure is locked as M _ O _ R.

Looking up valid English words matching M _ O _ R:
- M O O R – too short
- M O D O R – not standard
- M O B O R – not standard
- M O K O R – not standard
- M O V O R – not standard
- M O D O R – not standard
- M O D O R – not standard

Wait, there's a word ""MODOR"" which is an archaic or poetic term for a type of tree, but it's not common. However, ""MOTOR"" was already tried. 

Another possibility: ""MOYOR"" – but Y is allowed and ""MOYOR"" isn't a standard word.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only plausible combination that forms a valid word seems to be ""M O D O R"" (MODOR), even though it's not common. However, since the game accepts any valid 5-letter word, and MODOR is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling or botanical term, it might be acceptable.

Alternatively, ""M O K O R"" (MOKOR) – but this doesn't seem valid.

Another check: ""M O B O R"" – no.

""MOVOR"" – no.

""MOYOR"" – no.

""MOJOR"" – no.

""MOQOR"" – no.

""MOVOR"" – no.

""MOZOR"" – no.

Given the constraints, ""MODOR"" appears to be the only possible valid word left. Even if it's archaic, it fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, I'll guess MODOR.",Guess 5: MODOR -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(-) D(x) O(-) R(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
- DOES contain R, but NOT in position 2

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R (but not in position 2)
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A word like ""TRIOS"" comes to mind, but let me check:
- T: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since R is known to be elsewhere)
- I: possible
- O: possible
- S: possible

But ""TRIOS"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5.

Let me try ""DRIPS"":
- D: possible
- R: possible (position 2 is allowed since we only know R is not in position 2 from CRANE, but we don't know about others)
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but wrong position. In CRANE, R was in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1,3,4,5.

""DRIPS"" has R in position 2 - that's bad, same as TRIOS.

Let me try ""FRISK"":
- F: possible
- R: position 2 - again bad.

""GRIST"":
- G: possible
- R: position 2 - bad.

""SPRIG"":

- R: position 3 - possible (since R was not in position 3 before)
- I: possible
- G: possible

This seems better - R is in position 3, which we haven't ruled out.

""SPRIG"" uses:
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- R: in position 3 (not ruled out)
- I: new vowel
- G: new letter

This should give us more information about remaining letters and the correct position of R.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. SPRIG → S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
   - Letters not in the word: S, P, I, G
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word contains R (and R is not in positions 2 or 3).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G.
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet, excluding the above):
  Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
  Vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only the remaining letters (B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, O, U)
- Contains R in position 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R)

Looking for common patterns, let's try to include O and U as the remaining vowels, and some frequent consonants like T, L, M, B, D, etc.

A promising word is ""BROTH"":
- B: allowed
- R: allowed (position 2 is ruled out, but here R is in position 2 - bad)
Wait, R in position 2 is ruled out from CRANE. So BROTH is invalid for R position.

Next option: ""FROST"":
- F: allowed
- R: position 2 - ruled out.

""DRUM"":

""TORUS"":

""BRISK"":

""DRIFT"":

""SCRUB"":

""SPRIG"":
- S, P, I, G are out.

""DRYER"":
- D: allowed
- R: position 4 (allowed)
- Y: allowed
- E: out (from CRANE)

""FRUIT"":
- I is out.

""FROND"":
- N is out.

""BROTH"":
- R in position 2 is ruled out.

""TORCH"":
- C is out.

""TORUS"":

""FLOUR"":

This seems valid:
- Letters: F, L, O, U, R
- R is in position 5 (not ruled out)
- No excluded letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
Guess 3: FLOUR -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on FLOUR:

- F: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- O: correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- U: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 5 is R

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ O _ R

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U

Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet, excluding the above):
Consonants: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (only O is allowed in position 3)

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with the remaining consonants, ensuring we use valid English words.

Looking for common patterns:
- Position 4 must be a consonant (since O is fixed in 3 and R in 5)
- Possible consonants for positions 1,2,4: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in ""O_R"" with the middle letter O.

Possible candidates:
- B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z for positions 1,2,4

Looking for common words:
- ""BODOR"" – not a valid word
- ""DOTOR"" – not valid
- ""HOTOR"" – not valid
- ""JOTOR"" – not valid
- ""KOTOR"" – not valid
- ""MOTOR"" – valid word! (M, O, T, O, R) but O is already in position 3, and this would have O in position 4 which is fine since O can appear twice
- ""VOTOR"" – not valid
- ""WOTOR"" – not valid
- ""YOTOR"" – not valid

""MOTOR"" fits perfectly:
- M: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2 is fine, only position 3 is fixed)
- T: allowed
- O: allowed (position 4 is fine)
- R: fixed at position 5

Let's verify:
- No excluded letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U) are used
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- R is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- All other letters are from the allowed set

Guess 4: MOTOR -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(-) T(x) O(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's carefully update what we now know from all feedback so far.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.

2. SPRIG → S(x) P(x) R(-) I(x) G(x)
   - R is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. FLOUR → F(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓)
   - O is in position 3.
   - R is in position 5.

4. MOTOR → M(✓) O(-) T(x) O(-) R(✓)
   - M is in position 1.
   - O is in position 3 (already known from FLOUR) but the feedback shows it's in the wrong position here. This seems contradictory at first glance, but looking back: in MOTOR, the O in position 2 is marked (-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. However, we already know from FLOUR that O is in position 3. This implies O is in position 3, so the O in position 2 is indeed in the wrong position, which is consistent. Similarly, the O in position 4 is marked (-), which is also consistent because O is only confirmed in position 3. The R in position 5 is confirmed again (✓).

So the confirmed structure is: M _ O _ R

Letters ruled out so far:
- From CRANE: C, A, N, E
- From SPRIG: S, P, I, G
- From FLOUR: F, L, U
- From MOTOR: T

Thus, the forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, S, P, I, G, F, L, U, T

Remaining possible consonants for positions 2 and 4: B, D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form M _ O _ R using only these remaining letters.

Looking for common words:
- M B O B R – not valid
- M B O D R – not valid
- M D O B R – not valid
- M D O D R – not valid
- M H O B R – not valid
- M H O D R – not valid
- M J O B R – not valid
- M J O D R – not valid
- M K O B R – not valid
- M K O D R – not valid
- M Q O B R – not valid
- M Q O D R – not valid
- M V O B R – not valid
- M V O D R – not valid
- M W O B R – not valid
- M W O D R – not valid
- M X O B R – not valid
- M X O D R – not valid
- M Y O B R – not valid
- M Y O D R – not valid
- M Z O B R – not valid
- M Z O D R – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently – maybe the word uses the same letters but in different positions, but the structure is locked as M _ O _ R.

Looking up valid English words matching M _ O _ R:
- M O O R – too short
- M O D O R – not standard
- M O B O R – not standard
- M O K O R – not standard
- M O V O R – not standard
- M O D O R – not standard
- M O D O R – not standard

Wait, there's a word ""MODOR"" which is an archaic or poetic term for a type of tree, but it's not common. However, ""MOTOR"" was already tried. 

Another possibility: ""MOYOR"" – but Y is allowed and ""MOYOR"" isn't a standard word.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only plausible combination that forms a valid word seems to be ""M O D O R"" (MODOR), even though it's not common. However, since the game accepts any valid 5-letter word, and MODOR is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling or botanical term, it might be acceptable.

From the latest feedback on MODOR:

- M(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- O(-) – the O in position 2 is in the word but in the wrong place.  
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – the O in position 4 is in the word but in the wrong place.
- R(✓) – position 5 is correct.

Combining with earlier knowledge:
- The word must be M _ O _ R (from FLOUR).
- The two O’s in positions 2 and 4 are both marked (-), which is consistent because we already know O is in position 3.  
- D is now ruled out, so position 2 cannot be D (but it already can’t be D anyway because position 3 is O).
- Therefore, position 2 must be O (the only place left for the second O), and position 4 must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

But wait: we already have O in position 3, so the word must contain O twice: once in position 3 and once elsewhere. The only remaining positions are 2 and 4.  
Since both O’s in positions 2 and 4 were marked (-), that means O must actually be in position 3, and the other O must appear in either position 2 or 4, but the feedback shows that the O in position 2 is “in word but wrong place” and the O in position 4 is also “in word but wrong place.”  
This can only mean that O is in position 3, and the word has no other O’s—because if it had another O, it would have to be in position 2 or 4, but both those O’s were marked as wrong position. Therefore, the word must have exactly one O, in position 3.  

Hence the structure is definitely M _ O _ R with only one O.

Letters still allowed for positions 2 and 4 (from remaining consonants): B, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
