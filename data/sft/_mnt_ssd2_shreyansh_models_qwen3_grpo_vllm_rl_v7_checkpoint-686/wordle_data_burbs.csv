For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses very common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): the letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E: all four of these letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S but NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H.

Possible candidates:
- RIONS (but O and N are good, S is in position 4)
- CRUSH (but H is less common)
- PRISON (too long)
- SONIC (good coverage: S, O, N, I, C)

SONIC uses S in position 2, and introduces O, N, I, C - all new letters not eliminated by previous feedback.

- The word contains the letter S, but **not** in position 1 or 2 (because S got “-” in both guesses and those positions are already ruled out).
- The letters L, A, T, E, O, N, I, C are **not** in the word at all.

Letters still available (among the most common): R, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 3, 4 or 5.
2. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.
3. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Let’s pick a word that puts S in position 3 and introduces R, U, P, and D.

A good candidate is “DRUSP” – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Next option: “PRUSH” – again, not valid.

Try “BURPS” – valid and uses B, U, R, P, S.

That gives us four fresh letters (B, U, R, P) plus moves S to position 5.

Interpretation:
- B is correct in position 1.
- U is correct in position 2.
- R is correct in position 3.
- S is correct in position 5.
- P is not in the word at all.

So the word structure is now:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses very common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): the letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E: all four of these letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S but NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H.

Possible candidates:
- RIONS (but O and N are good, S is in position 4)
- CRUSH (but H is less common)
- PRISON (too long)
- SONIC (good coverage: S, O, N, I, C)

SONIC uses S in position 2, and introduces O, N, I, C - all new letters not eliminated by previous feedback.

So far we have:

- SLATE: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- SONIC: S(-) O(x) N(x) I(x) C(x)

What we know for certain:
- The word contains the letter S, but **not** in position 1 or 2 (because S got “-” in both guesses and those positions are already ruled out).
- The letters L, A, T, E, O, N, I, C are **not** in the word at all.

Letters still available (among the most common): R, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 3, 4 or 5.
2. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.
3. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Let’s pick a word that puts S in position 3 and introduces R, U, P, and D.

A good candidate is “DRUSP” – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Next option: “PRUSH” – again, not valid.

Try “BURPS” – valid and uses B, U, R, P, S.

That gives us four fresh letters (B, U, R, P) plus moves S to position 5.

So I’ll go with BURPS.

- BURHS  

Valid English words among these:
- BURDS – plural of “bird” (but “birds” is 5 letters, matches pattern)
- BURKS – Scots spelling of “bucks” (valid but less common)
- BURGS – plural of “bourg” (valid)
- BURFS – not a standard word
- BURYS – not a standard word
- BURMS – not a standard word
- BURHS – archaic for “boroughs”

The clearest valid word is BURDS.

So I will guess BURDS.

From the four guesses we now have the exact pattern:

B U R _ S

and we know the fourth letter is NOT:  
L, A, T, E, O, N, I, C, P, D.

Still-available common letters for the 4th slot:  
F, G, K, M, H, W, Y, V, etc.

Scanning the pattern BUR_S for valid English words:

- BURKS – valid (Scots for bucks)  
- BURGS – valid (plural of bourgs)  
- BURYS – not standard  
- BURMS – not standard  
- BURHS – archaic  
- BURFS – not standard  

The two clearest valid choices are BURKS and BURGS.  
BURKS is slightly more common in everyday usage, so I’ll try it.
