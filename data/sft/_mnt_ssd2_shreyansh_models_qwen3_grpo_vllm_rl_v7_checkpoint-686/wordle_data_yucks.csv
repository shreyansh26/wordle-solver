For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. 

Some good starting words are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E.
- Letter S is present but not in position 4.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Next steps:
1. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Try new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).
3. A good candidate is “SLITN” but that’s not a word. Instead, “SLINT” isn’t valid either. A valid word with S plus other common letters is “STING” (S, T, I, N, G), but G hasn’t been tested yet. Another option is “SOUND” but O is already ruled out. “SUNNY” has Y which is less common. “SING” is only 4 letters. “STINK” is valid and uses S plus T, I, N, K.

I’ll choose STINK as it introduces T, I, N, K and keeps S in a new position (1 instead of 4).

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Absent letters: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)  
   – Absent letters now also include T, I, N.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – K is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and K (with S not in positions 1 or 4, and K not in position 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and K.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- K cannot be in position 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- S _ _ _ K → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- _ S _ _ K → S in 2 (allowed)  
- _ _ S _ K → S in 3 (allowed)  
- _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- _ _ _ K S → K in 5 (forbidden)  

Valid patterns:
- _ S _ _ K (S in 2)  
- _ _ S _ K (S in 3)  

Candidate words:
- USK (too short)  
- BUCKS (B, U, C allowed, S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUSHK (invalid)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- FUSKS (invalid)  
- JUSKS (invalid)  
- PUSKS (invalid)  
- WUSKS (invalid)  
- YUSKS (invalid)  

None of these work because S ends up in position 4.  
Let’s try S in position 2:  
- _ S _ _ K  

Possible letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ S _ _ K.

Examples:
- DUSKY → ends in Y, not K.  
- MUSKY → same.  
- LUSKY → same.  
- GUSKY → same.  
- YUSKY → same.  

None fit.  
Try S in position 3:  
- _ _ S _ K  

Valid words:
- BUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  

Still S in 4.  
We need a word where S is in 2 or 3 but not 1 or 4, and K is not in 5.

Another approach: list 5-letter words with S and K, filter by constraints.

Possible candidates:
- SKULK → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- KUSKS → K in 1 and 5, S in 2 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISSK → invalid  
- KISSY → no K in 5, but S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISKS → S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KUSKS → same issue  
- KISSY → same issue  

It seems hard to avoid S in 4.  
Let’s try a word where S is in 2 and K is in 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden for S, not for K).

Pattern: _ S K _ _  
But then K is in 3, which is allowed.  
And S is in 2, allowed.  
And K not in 5.  
And we use only allowed letters.

Example:  
- D S K _ _ → DSK** → need valid word.  
Valid 5-letter words:  
- DSK** → none.  
- MSK** → none.  
- LSK** → none.  

Another pattern: _ _ S K _  
S in 3, K in 4 (allowed for K).  
And we need valid word _ _ S K _.

Examples:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

Still S in 4.  
Try _ S _ K _  
S in 2, K in 4.  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- DUSKY → ends Y  
- MUSKY → same  
- LUSKY → same  
- GUSKY → same  
- YUSKY → same  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (but K cannot be in 5, already handled).  

It seems the only viable pattern is _ _ S K _ with S in 3 and K in 4, but all common words ending like _ _ S K _ with allowed letters are scarce.

Let’s list possible _ _ S K _ words using allowed letters:
- B, C, D, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

None.  
Try _ S _ _ K again with different letters:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

Wait, let’s try:
- DUSKY → no K  
- MUSKY → no K  

Actually, we need _ S _ _ K.  
Valid words:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (allowed for S in 5, since forbidden were 1 and 4).  

So pattern: _ _ K _ S  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 5, K in 3.  
  Letters: B, U, C, K, S.  
  All letters allowed (B, U, C not yet ruled out).  
  S in 5 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed).  

Let’s check:  
- B (new)  
- U (new)  
- C (new)  
- K (in word)  
- S (in word)  

No conflicts.  

So BUCKS fits all constraints:
- Contains S and K.  
- S not in 1 or 4, here in 5.  
- K not in 5, here in 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B, U, C).  

Therefore, BUCKS is a valid next guess.

- WUSKS (invalid)  
- YUSKS (invalid)  

None of these work because S ends up in position 4.  
Let’s try S in position 2:  
- _ S _ _ K  

Possible letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ S _ _ K.

Examples:
- DUSKY → ends in Y, not K.  
- MUSKY → same.  
- LUSKY → same.  
- GUSKY → same.  
- YUSKY → same.  

None fit.  
Try S in position 3:  
- _ _ S _ K  

Valid words:
- BUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  

Still S in 4.  
We need a word where S is in 2 or 3 but not 1 or 4, and K is not in 5.

Another approach: list 5-letter words with S and K, filter by constraints.

Possible candidates:
- SKULK → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- KUSKS → K in 1 and 5, S in 2 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISSK → invalid  
- KISSY → no K in 5, but S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISKS → S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KUSKS → same issue  
- KISSY → same issue  

It seems hard to avoid S in 4.  
Let’s try a word where S is in 2 and K is in 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden for S, not for K).

Pattern: _ S K _ _  
But then K is in 3, which is allowed.  
And S is in 2, allowed.  
And K not in 5.  
And we use only allowed letters.

Example:  
- D S K _ _ → DSK** → need valid word.  
Valid 5-letter words:  
- DSK** → none.  
- MSK** → none.  
- LSK** → none.  

Another pattern: _ _ S K _  
S in 3, K in 4 (allowed for K).  
And we need valid word _ _ S K _.

Examples:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

Still S in 4.  
Try _ S _ K _  
S in 2, K in 4.  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- DUSKY → ends Y  
- MUSKY → same  
- LUSKY → same  
- GUSKY → same  
- YUSKY → same  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (but K cannot be in 5, already handled).  

It seems the only viable pattern is _ _ S K _ with S in 3 and K in 4, but all common words ending like _ _ S K _ with allowed letters are scarce.

Let’s list possible _ _ S K _ words using allowed letters:
- B, C, D, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

None.  
Try _ S _ _ K again with different letters:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

Wait, let’s try:
- DUSKY → no K  
- MUSKY → no K  

Actually, we need _ S _ _ K.  
Valid words:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (allowed for S in 5, since forbidden were 1 and 4).  

So pattern: _ _ K _ S  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 5, K in 3.  
  Letters: B, U, C, K, S.  
  All letters allowed (B, U, C not yet ruled out).  
  S in 5 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed).  

Let’s check:  
- B (new)  
- U (new)  
- C (new)  
- K (in word)  
- S (in word)  

No conflicts.  

So BUCKS fits all constraints:
- Contains S and K.  
- S not in 1 or 4, here in 5.  
- K not in 5, here in 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B, U, C).  

Therefore, BUCKS is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: BUCKS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) C(✓) K(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. 

Some good starting words are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E.
- Letter S is present but not in position 4.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Next steps:
1. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Try new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).
3. A good candidate is “SLITN” but that’s not a word. Instead, “SLINT” isn’t valid either. A valid word with S plus other common letters is “STING” (S, T, I, N, G), but G hasn’t been tested yet. Another option is “SOUND” but O is already ruled out. “SUNNY” has Y which is less common. “SING” is only 4 letters. “STINK” is valid and uses S plus T, I, N, K.

I’ll choose STINK as it introduces T, I, N, K and keeps S in a new position (1 instead of 4).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Absent letters: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)  
   – Absent letters now also include T, I, N.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – K is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and K (with S not in positions 1 or 4, and K not in position 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and K.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- K cannot be in position 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- S _ _ _ K → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- _ S _ _ K → S in 2 (allowed)  
- _ _ S _ K → S in 3 (allowed)  
- _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- _ _ _ K S → K in 5 (forbidden)  

Valid patterns:
- _ S _ _ K (S in 2)  
- _ _ S _ K (S in 3)  

Candidate words:
- USK (too short)  
- BUCKS (B, U, C allowed, S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUSHK (invalid)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- FUSKS (invalid)  
- JUSKS (invalid)  
- PUSKS (invalid)  
- WUSKS (invalid)  
- YUSKS (invalid)  

None of these work because S ends up in position 4.  
Let’s try S in position 2:  
- _ S _ _ K  

Possible letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ S _ _ K.

Examples:
- DUSKY → ends in Y, not K.  
- MUSKY → same.  
- LUSKY → same.  
- GUSKY → same.  
- YUSKY → same.  

None fit.  
Try S in position 3:  
- _ _ S _ K  

Valid words:
- BUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  

Still S in 4.  
We need a word where S is in 2 or 3 but not 1 or 4, and K is not in 5.

Another approach: list 5-letter words with S and K, filter by constraints.

Possible candidates:
- SKULK → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- KUSKS → K in 1 and 5, S in 2 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISSK → invalid  
- KISSY → no K in 5, but S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISKS → S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KUSKS → same issue  
- KISSY → same issue  

It seems hard to avoid S in 4.  
Let’s try a word where S is in 2 and K is in 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden for S, not for K).

Pattern: _ S K _ _  
But then K is in 3, which is allowed.  
And S is in 2, allowed.  
And K not in 5.  
And we use only allowed letters.

Example:  
- D S K _ _ → DSK** → need valid word.  
Valid 5-letter words:  
- DSK** → none.  
- MSK** → none.  
- LSK** → none.  

Another pattern: _ _ S K _  
S in 3, K in 4 (allowed for K).  
And we need valid word _ _ S K _.

Examples:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

Still S in 4.  
Try _ S _ K _  
S in 2, K in 4.  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- DUSKY → ends Y  
- MUSKY → same  
- LUSKY → same  
- GUSKY → same  
- YUSKY → same  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (but K cannot be in 5, already handled).  

It seems the only viable pattern is _ _ S K _ with S in 3 and K in 4, but all common words ending like _ _ S K _ with allowed letters are scarce.

Let’s list possible _ _ S K _ words using allowed letters:
- B, C, D, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same

None.  
Try _ S _ _ K again with different letters:

- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (allowed for S in 5, since forbidden were 1 and 4).  

So pattern: _ _ K _ S  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 5, K in 3.  
  Letters: B, U, C, K, S.  
  All letters allowed (B, U, C not yet ruled out).  
  S in 5 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed).  

Let’s check:  
- B (new)  
- U (new)  
- C (new)  
- K (in word)  
- S (in word)  

No conflicts.  

So BUCKS fits all constraints:
- Contains S and K.  
- S not in 1 or 4, here in 5.  
- K not in 5, here in 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B, U, C).  

Therefore, BUCKS is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. 

Some good starting words are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E.
- Letter S is present but not in position 4.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Next steps:
1. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Try new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).
3. A good candidate is “SLITN” but that’s not a word. Instead, “SLINT” isn’t valid either. A valid word with S plus other common letters is “STING” (S, T, I, N, G), but G hasn’t been tested yet. Another option is “SOUND” but O is already ruled out. “SUNNY” has Y which is less common. “SING” is only 4 letters. “STINK” is valid and uses S plus T, I, N, K.

I’ll choose STINK as it introduces T, I, N, K and keeps S in a new position (1 instead of 4).

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Absent letters: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)  
   – Absent letters now also include T, I, N.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – K is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and K (with S not in positions 1 or 4, and K not in position 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and K.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- K cannot be in position 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- S _ _ _ K → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- _ S _ _ K → S in 2 (allowed)  
- _ _ S _ K → S in 3 (allowed)  
- _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- _ _ _ K S → K in 5 (forbidden)  

Valid patterns:
- _ S _ _ K (S in 2)  
- _ _ S _ K (S in 3)  

Candidate words:
- USK (too short)  
- BUCKS (B, U, C allowed, S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUSHK (invalid)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- FUSKS (invalid)  
- JUSKS (invalid)  
- PUSKS (invalid)  
- WUSKS (invalid)  
- YUSKS (invalid)  

None of these work because S ends up in position 4.  
Let’s try S in position 2:  
- _ S _ _ K  

Possible letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ S _ _ K.

Examples:
- DUSKY → ends in Y, not K.  
- MUSKY → same.  
- LUSKY → same.  
- GUSKY → same.  
- YUSKY → same.  

None fit.  
Try S in position 3:  
- _ _ S _ K  

Valid words:
- BUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  

Still S in 4.  
We need a word where S is in 2 or 3 but not 1 or 4, and K is not in 5.

Another approach: list 5-letter words with S and K, filter by constraints.

Possible candidates:
- SKULK → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- KUSKS → K in 1 and 5, S in 2 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISSK → invalid  
- KISSY → no K in 5, but S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISKS → S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KUSKS → same issue  
- KISSY → same issue  

It seems hard to avoid S in 4.  
Let’s try a word where S is in 2 and K is in 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden for S, not for K).

Pattern: _ S K _ _  
But then K is in 3, which is allowed.  
And S is in 2, allowed.  
And K not in 5.  
And we use only allowed letters.

Example:  
- D S K _ _ → DSK** → need valid word.  
Valid 5-letter words:  
- DSK** → none.  
- MSK** → none.  
- LSK** → none.  

Another pattern: _ _ S K _  
S in 3, K in 4 (allowed for K).  
And we need valid word _ _ S K _.

Examples:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

Still S in 4.  
Try _ S _ K _  
S in 2, K in 4.  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- DUSKY → ends Y  
- MUSKY → same  
- LUSKY → same  
- GUSKY → same  
- YUSKY → same  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (but K cannot be in 5, already handled).  

It seems the only viable pattern is _ _ S K _ with S in 3 and K in 4, but all common words ending like _ _ S K _ with allowed letters are scarce.

Let’s list possible _ _ S K _ words using allowed letters:
- B, C, D, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

None.  
Try _ S _ _ K again with different letters:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

Wait, let’s try:
- DUSKY → no K  
- MUSKY → no K  

Actually, we need _ S _ _ K.  
Valid words:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (allowed for S in 5, since forbidden were 1 and 4).  

So pattern: _ _ K _ S  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 5, K in 3.  
  Letters: B, U, C, K, S.  
  All letters allowed (B, U, C not yet ruled out).  
  S in 5 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed).  

Let’s check:  
- B (new)  
- U (new)  
- C (new)  
- K (in word)  
- S (in word)  

No conflicts.  

So BUCKS fits all constraints:
- Contains S and K.  
- S not in 1 or 4, here in 5.  
- K not in 5, here in 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B, U, C).  

Therefore, BUCKS is a valid next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. 

Some good starting words are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E.
- Letter S is present but not in position 4.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Next steps:
1. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Try new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).
3. A good candidate is “SLITN” but that’s not a word. Instead, “SLINT” isn’t valid either. A valid word with S plus other common letters is “STING” (S, T, I, N, G), but G hasn’t been tested yet. Another option is “SOUND” but O is already ruled out. “SUNNY” has Y which is less common. “SING” is only 4 letters. “STINK” is valid and uses S plus T, I, N, K.

I’ll choose STINK as it introduces T, I, N, K and keeps S in a new position (1 instead of 4).

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Absent letters: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)  
   – Absent letters now also include T, I, N.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – K is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and K (with S not in positions 1 or 4, and K not in position 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and K.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- K cannot be in position 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- S _ _ _ K → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- _ S _ _ K → S in 2 (allowed)  
- _ _ S _ K → S in 3 (allowed)  
- _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- _ _ _ K S → K in 5 (forbidden)  

Valid patterns:
- _ S _ _ K (S in 2)  
- _ _ S _ K (S in 3)  

Candidate words:
- USK (too short)  
- BUCKS (B, U, C allowed, S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUSHK (invalid)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUSKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- FUSKS (invalid)  
- JUSKS (invalid)  
- PUSKS (invalid)  
- WUSKS (invalid)  
- YUSKS (invalid)  

None of these work because S ends up in position 4.  
Let’s try S in position 2:  
- _ S _ _ K  

Possible letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ S _ _ K.

Examples:
- DUSKY → ends in Y, not K.  
- MUSKY → same.  
- LUSKY → same.  
- GUSKY → same.  
- YUSKY → same.  

None fit.  
Try S in position 3:  
- _ _ S _ K  

Valid words:
- BUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- DUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- MUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- LUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- GUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- YUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- CUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  
- HUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  

Still S in 4.  
We need a word where S is in 2 or 3 but not 1 or 4, and K is not in 5.

Another approach: list 5-letter words with S and K, filter by constraints.

Possible candidates:
- SKULK → S in 1 (forbidden)  
- KUSKS → K in 1 and 5, S in 2 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISSK → invalid  
- KISSY → no K in 5, but S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KISKS → S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  
- KUSKS → same issue  
- KISSY → same issue  

It seems hard to avoid S in 4.  
Let’s try a word where S is in 2 and K is in 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden for S, not for K).

Pattern: _ S K _ _  
But then K is in 3, which is allowed.  
And S is in 2, allowed.  
And K not in 5.  
And we use only allowed letters.

Example:  
- D S K _ _ → DSK** → need valid word.  
Valid 5-letter words:  
- DSK** → none.  
- MSK** → none.  
- LSK** → none.  

Another pattern: _ _ S K _  
S in 3, K in 4 (allowed for K).  
And we need valid word _ _ S K _.

Examples:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

Still S in 4.  
Try _ S _ K _  
S in 2, K in 4.  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- DUSKY → ends Y  
- MUSKY → same  
- LUSKY → same  
- GUSKY → same  
- YUSKY → same  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (but K cannot be in 5, already handled).  

It seems the only viable pattern is _ _ S K _ with S in 3 and K in 4, but all common words ending like _ _ S K _ with allowed letters are scarce.

Let’s list possible _ _ S K _ words using allowed letters:
- B, C, D, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  
- DUCKS → same  
- MUCKS → same  
- LUCKS → same  
- GUCKS → same  
- YUCKS → same  
- CUCKS → same  
- HUCKS → same  

None.  
Try _ S _ _ K again with different letters:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

Wait, let’s try:
- DUSKY → no K  
- MUSKY → no K  

Actually, we need _ S _ _ K.  
Valid words:
- DUSKY → no  
- MUSKY → no  
- LUSKY → no  
- GUSKY → no  
- YUSKY → no  

None.  
Try _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  
Try _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (allowed for S in 5, since forbidden were 1 and 4).  

So pattern: _ _ K _ S  
Letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.

Valid words:
- BUCKS → S in 5, K in 3.  
  Letters: B, U, C, K, S.  
  All letters allowed (B, U, C not yet ruled out).  
  S in 5 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed).  

Let’s check:  
- B (new)  
- U (new)  
- C (new)  
- K (in word)  
- S (in word)  

No conflicts.  

So BUCKS fits all constraints:
- Contains S and K.  
- S not in 1 or 4, here in 5.  
- K not in 5, here in 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B, U, C).  

Therefore, BUCKS is a valid next guess.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with any letter except the ruled-out ones (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, B) and ends with UCKS.

Common letters left for position 1: D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible valid words:
- DUCKS – but we already considered this and it was a candidate.
- F U C K S – not a valid English word.
- G U C K S – not a valid English word.
- H U C K S – ""HUCKS"" is not standard.

- P U C K S – not standard.
- V U C K S – not standard.
- W U C K S – not standard.
- Y U C K S – not standard.

The most likely valid word is ""DUCKS"", even though we haven't ruled out D yet. However, we haven't tried D, and it's a common word.

Therefore, the only remaining candidate is DUCKS.The feedback from BUCKS locked in the last four letters as U C K S in positions 2-5. The only common 5-letter word that fits _ U C K S is:

Include S somewhere other than position 4.\n2. Try new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).\n3. A good candidate is “SLITN” but that’s not a word. Instead, “SLINT” isn’t valid either. A valid word with S plus other common letters is “STING” (S, T, I, N, G), but G hasn’t been tested yet. Another option is “SOUND” but O is already ruled out. “SUNNY” has Y which is less common. “SING” is only 4 letters. “STINK” is valid and uses S plus T, I, N, K.\n\nI’ll choose STINK as it introduces T, I, N, K and keeps S in a new position (1 instead of 4).\n\n<guess>STINK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) K(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

position 4.  \nLet’s try S in position 2:  \n- _ S _ _ K  \n\nPossible letters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.  \nWe need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ S _ _ K.\n\nExamples:\n- DUSKY → ends in Y, not K.  \n- MUSKY → same.  \n- LUSKY → same.  \n- GUSKY → same.  \n- YUSKY → same.  \n\nNone fit.  \nTry S in position 3:  \n- _ _ S _ K  \n\nValid words:\n- BUCKS (S in 4 – forbidden)  \n- DUCKS (S

forbidden)  \n\nStill S in 4.  \nWe need a word where S is in 2 or 3 but not 1 or 4, and K is not in 5.\n\nAnother approach: list 5-letter words with S and K, filter by constraints.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- SKULK → S in 1 (forbidden)  \n- KUSKS → K in 1 and 5, S in 2 and 4 (4 forbidden)  \n- KISSK → invalid  \n- KISSY → no K in 5, but S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  \n- KISKS → S in 3 and 4 (4 forbidden)  \n- KUSKS → same issue  \n- KISSY → same issue  \n\nIt seems hard to avoid S in 4.  \nLet’s try a word where S is in 2 and K is in 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden for S, not for K).\n\nPattern: _ S K _ _  \nBut then K is in 3, which is allowed.  \nAnd S is in 2, allowed.  \nAnd K not in 5.  \nAnd we use only allowed letters.\n\nExample:  \n- D S K _ _ → DSK** → need valid word.  \nValid 5-letter words:  \n- DSK** → none.  \n- MSK** → none.  \n- LSK** → none.  \n\nAnother pattern: _ _ S K _  \nS in 3, K in 4 (allowed for K).  \nAnd we need valid word _ _ S K _.\n\nExamples:\n- BUCKS →

\nTry _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (but K cannot be in 5, already handled).  \n\nIt seems the only viable pattern is _ _ S K _ with S in 3 and K in 4, but all common words ending like _ _ S K _ with allowed letters are scarce.\n\nLet’s list possible _ _ S K _ words using allowed letters:\n- B, C, D, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.\n\nValid words:\n- BUCKS → S in 4 (forbidden)  \n- DUCKS → same  \n- MUCKS

 \n- GUSKY → no  \n- YUSKY → no  \n\nWait, let’s try:\n- DUSKY → no K  \n- MUSKY → no K  \n\nActually, we need _ S _ _ K.  \nValid words:\n- DUSKY → no  \n- MUSKY → no  \n- LUSKY → no  \n- GUSKY → no  \n- YUSKY → no  \n\nNone.  \nTry _ _ _ S K → S in 4 (forbidden)  \nTry _ _ K _ S → K in 3, S in 5 (allowed for S in 5, since forbidden were 1 and 4).  \n\nSo pattern: _ _ K _ S  \nLetters left: D, L, M, U, Y, C, G, H, etc.\n\nValid words:\n- BUCKS → S in 5, K in 3.  \n  Letters: B, U, C, K, S.  \n  All letters allowed (B, U, C not yet ruled out).  \n  S in 5 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed).  \n\nLet’s check:  \n- B (new)  \n- U (new)  \n- C (new)  \n- K (in word)  \n- S (in word)  \n\nNo conflicts.  \n\nSo BUCKS fits all constraints:\n- Contains S and K.  \n- S not in 1 or 4, here in 5.  \n- K not

We now have five guesses and the pattern is locked to _ U C K S with positions 2-5 fixed as U C K S.  
Letters already ruled out for position 1 are: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, B, D, M.

Remaining single-letter possibilities for position 1 that form a valid English word ending in UCKS are limited.  
Scanning the alphabet:

- F → “FUCKS” – informal but recognized in some dictionaries (e.g., Merriam-Webster’s slang section).  
- G → “GUCKS” – not standard.  
- H → “HUCKS” – not standard.

- P → “PUCKS” – not standard.  
- V → “VUCKS” – not standard.  
- W → “WUCKS” – not standard.  
- Y → “YUCKS” – not standard.

The only remaining valid (if informal) word is “FUCKS”. Since no other common English word fits and the game allows any valid word, “FUCKS” must be the sixth and final guess.
