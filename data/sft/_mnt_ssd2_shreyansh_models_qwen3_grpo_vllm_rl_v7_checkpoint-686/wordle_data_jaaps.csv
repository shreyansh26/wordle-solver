For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels and two very common consonants. This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Summary of constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word: A (fixed at position 3), S (somewhere other than 1 or 4).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

- No R, O, E, T, I, N
- Other letters from remaining pool.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 to maximize information. A good candidate is “PLASD” but that’s not a valid word. Instead, “CLASP” has S in position 5 but uses C, L, A, S, P. However, A must be in position 3, so let’s construct a word with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5.

A valid word: “SCAMP” – but it has an M and P which are untested, and A is in position 3, S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1). So that’s invalid.

Next option: S in position 2. Example: “SALAD” – but A is already fixed at position 3, so “SALAD” has A in position 3, but also in 1 and 4, which might not help.

Better: “SALAD” is invalid because S cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE feedback). So S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: “SACAL” – not a valid word.

Valid word with A in position 3 and S in position 2: “SCARF” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SALAD” – invalid S position.

Another valid word: “SALSA” – but A is in position 3, S in 1 and 5, but S cannot be in 1.

Let’s try S in position 5: “PLASM” – but M is untested, and we need a valid word.

A valid word: “CLASP” – A in position 3, S in position 5, and letters C, L, P are new.

But let’s verify: C-L-A-S-P: A is in position 3 (✓), S is in position 5 (allowed), and no excluded letters. This seems valid.

However, “CLASP” is a valid word meaning to fasten with a clamp. Let’s use it.

From Guess 3 (CLASP) we now know:

- C is NOT in the word.
- L is NOT in the word.
- A is still correctly placed at position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because it was marked “-” at position 4 in Guess 1 and “-” at position 5 in Guess 3, so it cannot be in 4 or 5).
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was marked “-” at position 5).

So the constraints so far:
- Position 3 = A (fixed).
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot for S).
- P must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is now taken by S), so 1 or 4.
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L.
- Remaining possible letters (common ones): D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

With S locked into position 2, the word pattern is:
_ S A _ _

And P must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ S A _ _ with P in 1 or 4, and no excluded letters:

- P S A _ _ → but P and S are both required, so P S A _ _ is invalid (S cannot be after P in this pattern).
- _ S A P _ → valid if first letter is allowed.
- _ S A _ P → valid if first letter is allowed.

Looking at valid English words:
- “PSARP” – invalid.
- “DSAMP” – invalid.
- “MSAMP” – invalid.
- “USASP” – invalid.
- “YSAWP” – invalid.

Actually, let’s think systematically. The pattern is _ S A _ _ with P in 1 or 4, and no R,O,E,T,I,N,C,L.

Possible first letters: D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try P in position 4: _ S A P _
- First letter: D, G, H, M, U, Y.
- Last letter: must be from remaining letters (D,G,H,M,U,Y) and form a valid word.

Valid word: “D S A P _” – nothing obvious.
“G S A P _” – nothing.
“H S A P _” – nothing.
“M S A P _” – nothing.
“U S A P _” – nothing.
“Y S A P _” – nothing.

Now try P in position 1: P S A _ _
- Last letter: must be from remaining letters (D,G,H,M,U,Y) and form a valid word.
Valid word: P S A D _ – nothing.
P S A G _ – nothing.
P S A H _ – nothing.
P S A M _ – nothing.
P S A U _ – nothing.
P S A Y _ – nothing.

Wait, let’s list actual valid 5-letter words with pattern _ S A _ _ or P _ S A _ _ (but P must be 1 or 4).

Actually, the pattern is _ S A _ _ with P in 1 or 4.

Let me list valid words:
- “PSASP” – invalid.
- “DSAMP” – invalid.
- “MSAMP” – invalid.
- “USAMP” – invalid.
- “YSAWP” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the word must be _ S A _ _ with P in 1 or 4, and no excluded letters.

Let me try “USASP” – invalid.
“MSASP” – invalid.
“DSASP” – invalid.

Actually, let me think of words ending in P with S in position 2 and A in 3:
- “_ S A _ P”:
  - D S A _ P – “DSAP” is 4 letters.
  - G S A _ P – “GSAPP” – invalid.
  - H S A _ P – “HSAPP” – invalid.
  - M S A _ P – “MSAPP” – invalid.
  - U S A _ P – “USAPP” – invalid.
  - Y S A _ P – “YSAPP” – invalid.

Let me try P in position 1: P S A _ _
- Last letter: must be from remaining letters (D,G,H,M,U,Y) and form a valid word.
Valid word: P S A D _ – nothing.
P S A G _ – nothing.
P S A H _ – nothing.
P S A M _ – nothing.
P S A U _ – nothing.
P S A Y _ – nothing.

Wait, let me list actual valid English words with these constraints.

Valid word: “PSARP” – invalid.
“DSAMP” – invalid.
“MSAMP” – invalid.
“USAMP” – invalid.
“YSAWP” – invalid.

Actually, let me think differently. The pattern is _ S A _ _ with P in 1 or 4, and no R,O,E,T,I,N,C,L.

Let me try P in position 4: _ S A P _
- First letter: must be from remaining letters (D,G,H,M,U,Y).
Valid word: D S A P _ – nothing.
G S A P _ – nothing.
H S A P _ – nothing.
M S A P _ – nothing.
U S A P _ – nothing.
Y S A P _ – nothing.

Let me try P in position 1: P S A _ _
- Last letter: must be from remaining letters (D,G,H,M,U,Y).
Valid word: P S A D _ – nothing.
P S A G _ – nothing.
P S A H _ – nothing.
P S A M _ – nothing.
P S A U _ – nothing.
P S A Y _ – nothing.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be _ S A _ _ with:
- S in position 2 (only remaining spot for S).
- P must be in 1 or 4.
- No R,O,E,T,I,N,C,L.

Let me try P in position 4: _ S A P _
- First letter: must be from remaining letters (D,G,H,M,U,Y).
Valid word: “D S A P _” – nothing.

“H S A P _” – nothing.
“M S A P _” – nothing.
“U S A P _” – nothing.

“P S A H _” – nothing.
“P S A M _” – nothing.
“P S A U _” – nothing.

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me list all possible letters:

Excluded letters: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L.
Remaining letters: A, S, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

But A is fixed at 3, S at 2, P at 1 or 4.

Let me list all valid 5-letter words with A in position 3, S in position 2 or 5, and no excluded letters.

But S cannot be in 1,4,5 (from feedback), so S must be in position 2.

Thus pattern: _ S A _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels and two very common consonants. This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S
2. Does not contain R, O, or E
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Good consonants left: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out)

Let me try a word that uses common remaining letters. ""STAIN"" is a good candidate:
- Contains S and A
- Doesn't use R, O, E
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from position 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from position 1)
- Uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STAIN:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is not in the word.
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- I is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word: A (fixed at position 3), S (somewhere other than 1 or 4).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Vowels still possible: U (A is already placed).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5)
- No R, O, E, T, I, N
- Other letters from remaining pool.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 to maximize information. A good candidate is “PLASD” but that’s not a valid word. Instead, “CLASP” has S in position 5 but uses C, L, A, S, P. However, A must be in position 3, so let’s construct a word with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5.

A valid word: “SCAMP” – but it has an M and P which are untested, and A is in position 3, S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1). So that’s invalid.

Next option: S in position 2. Example: “SALAD” – but A is already fixed at position 3, so “SALAD” has A in position 3, but also in 1 and 4, which might not help.

Better: “SALAD” is invalid because S cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE feedback). So S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: “SACAL” – not a valid word.

Valid word with A in position 3 and S in position 2: “SCARF” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SALAD” – invalid S position.

Another valid word: “SALSA” – but A is in position 3, S in 1 and 5, but S cannot be in 1.

Let’s try S in position 5: “PLASM” – but M is untested, and we need a valid word.

A valid word: “CLASP” – A in position 3, S in position 5, and letters C, L, P are new.

But let’s verify: C-L-A-S-P: A is in position 3 (✓), S is in position 5 (allowed), and no excluded letters. This seems valid.

However, “CLASP” is a valid word meaning to fasten with a clamp. Let’s use it.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is correctly placed in position 3.

3. CLASP → C(x) L(x) A(✓) S(-) P(-)
   - C, L are not in the word.
   - A is correctly placed in position 3 (confirmed).
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (already known) and now also not in position 5.
   - P is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in 1, 2, or 4).

Current constraints:
- Positions: _ _ A _ _
- Letters in word: A (pos 3), S (must be in pos 2), P (must be in pos 1 or 4)
- Letters NOT in word: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L

Remaining possible letters (from alphabet excluding known absent letters): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 2
- A in position 3
- P in position 1 or 4
- Other letters from remaining pool

Possible patterns:
1. P S A _ _
2. _ S A P _

Let's explore valid English words fitting these patterns.

1. P S A _ _:
   - Possible: PSALM (but L is excluded)
   - Next: PSASP (not a word)
   - No valid words here.

2. _ S A P _:
   - First letter: remaining options (B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
   - Last letter: remaining options
   - Let's try common consonants:
     - B: B S A P _ → BSAP? (no)
     - D: D S A P _ → DSAP? (no)
     - F: F S A P _ → FSAP? (no)
     - G: G S A P _ → GSAP? (no)
     - H: H S A P _ → HSAP? (no)
     - K: K S A P _ → KSAP? (no)
     - M: M S A P _ → MSAP? (no)
     - U: U S A P _ → USAP? (no)
     - Y: Y S A P _ → YSAP? (no)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed another pattern.

Wait, let's reconsider P placement. CLASP feedback said P is in the word but wrong position (it was in position 5). So P could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but:
- 3 is A
- 2 is S
So P must be in position 1 or 4.

We have:
- P S A _ _  or  _ S A P _

Looking up valid 5-letter words:
- P S A _ _: No valid words (as above)
- _ S A P _: Valid word is ""USPAS"" (but not common), ""MSAPS"" (invalid), ""QSAPS"" (invalid)... actually, ""USPAS"" is a type of rifle but not common. 

Wait, let's think differently - maybe P is in position 4:
_ S A P _

Looking for valid words:
- B S A P _ → BSAP? (no)
- D S A P _ → DSAP? (no)
- F S A P _ → FSAP? (no)
- G S A P _ → GSAP? (no)
- H S A P _ → HSAP? (no)

This suggests I might have missed another possible pattern. Let me re-examine constraints.

Actually, P was in position 5 in CLASP and got ""wrong position"", so P could be in positions 1,2,3,4. But:
- 3 is A
- 2 is S
So P must be in 1 or 4.

We have:
- P S A _ _
- _ S A P _

Looking up valid English words:
- P S A _ _: No valid words
- _ S A P _: Valid word is ""USPAS"" (as mentioned), but let's check ""MSAPS"" - no.

Wait, let's try ""PSASP"" - invalid. 

Actually, there's a valid word ""PSALM"" but L is excluded. 

I think the only possible valid word fitting is ""USPAS"" but it's uncommon. 

However, let me check ""QSAPS"" - no. 

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed another possibility - could P be in position 4 with a different starting letter?

Looking up valid English words with pattern _ S A P _:
- ""USPAS"" (as above)
- ""MSAPS"" - invalid
- ""QSAPS"" - invalid
- ""HSAPS"" - invalid

This suggests ""USPAS"" might be the intended word despite being uncommon. 

But let me think of other possibilities - maybe ""PSASP"" isn't valid. 

Alternatively, maybe P is in position 1:
P S A _ _

Looking for valid words:
- PSALM - L excluded
- PSASP - invalid
- PSATS - T excluded

""PSAYS"" is a valid word (past tense of ""to psalm"" or ""to say"" in some contexts). 

Let's check:
- P in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (correct)
- Y in position 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters (R,O,E,T,I,N,C,L)

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels and two very common consonants. This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S
2. Does not contain R, O, or E
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Good consonants left: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out)

Let me try a word that uses common remaining letters. ""STAIN"" is a good candidate:
- Contains S and A
- Doesn't use R, O, E
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from position 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from position 1)
- Uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested

From the new feedback on STAIN:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is not in the word.
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- I is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word: A (fixed at position 3), S (somewhere other than 1 or 4).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Vowels still possible: U (A is already placed).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5)
- No R, O, E, T, I, N
- Other letters from remaining pool.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 to maximize information. A good candidate is “PLASD” but that’s not a valid word. Instead, “CLASP” has S in position 5 but uses C, L, A, S, P. However, A must be in position 3, so let’s construct a word with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5.

A valid word: “SCAMP” – but it has an M and P which are untested, and A is in position 3, S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1). So that’s invalid.

Next option: S in position 2. Example: “SALAD” – but A is already fixed at position 3, so “SALAD” has A in position 3, but also in 1 and 4, which might not help.

Better: “SALAD” is invalid because S cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE feedback). So S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: “SACAL” – not a valid word.

Valid word with A in position 3 and S in position 2: “SCARF” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SALAD” – invalid S position.

Another valid word: “SALSA” – but A is in position 3, S in 1 and 5, but S cannot be in 1.

Let’s try S in position 5: “PLASM” – but M is untested, and we need a valid word.

A valid word: “CLASP” – A in position 3, S in position 5, and letters C, L, P are new.

But let’s verify: C-L-A-S-P: A is in position 3 (✓), S is in position 5 (allowed), and no excluded letters. This seems valid.

However, “CLASP” is a valid word meaning to fasten with a clamp. Let’s use it.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – R, O, E are absent.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.
   – T, I, N are absent.
   – A is fixed in position 3.

3. CLASP → C(x) L(x) A(✓) S(-) P(-)
   – C, L are absent.
   – A is still fixed in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4 (already known) and not in position 5 (new).
   – P is in the word but not in position 5 (new).

4. PSAYS → P(-) S(-) A(✓) Y(x) S(✓)
   – P is in the word but not in position 1 (new).
   – S is in the word but not in position 2 (new).
   – A is still fixed in position 3.
   – Y is absent.
   – S is correctly placed in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ S
- Letters in word: A (pos 3), S (pos 5), P (somewhere not 1,5), S (already pos 5)
- Letters absent: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L, Y
- S is already in position 5, so no other S elsewhere (since duplicate S would have been marked differently).

Thus:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- Known:   ? ? A ? S
- P must be in position 2 or 4.
- Remaining possible letters (unused, not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting:
- _ P A _ S  or  _ _ A P S

Let’s list valid words:
- B P A _ S → BPAS? (no)
- D P A _ S → DPAS? (no)

- W P A _ S → WPAS? (no)
- Q P A _ S → QPAS? (no)
- X P A _ S → XPAS? (no)
- Z P A _ S → ZPAS? (no)

None of these are valid. Now check _ _ A P S:

- W A P S? (no)
- Q A P S? (no)
- X A P S? (no)
- Z A P S? (no)

Still nothing. This implies P must be in position 2, and we need a word like ? P A ? S.

Looking up valid English words with pattern ? P A ? S:

This is perplexing. Let me re-examine the constraints carefully.

Wait, the word must be _ _ A _ S with P somewhere in 2 or 4, and no excluded letters.

Looking at remaining consonants and vowels:
Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any vowels not yet excluded - only A is confirmed, U is still possible).

Let me try:
- B U A P S → ""BUAPS"" (invalid)
- D U A P S → ""DUAPS"" (invalid)
- F U A P S → ""FUAPS"" (invalid)
- G U A P S → ""GUAPS"" (invalid)

- K U A P S → ""KUAPS"" (invalid)
- M U A P S → ""MUAPS"" (invalid)
- V U A P S → ""VUAPS"" (invalid)
- W U A P S → ""WUAPS"" (invalid)

None valid. Let me try B in position 4:
_ _ A B S

But P must be in 2 or 4, so:
- _ P A B S → ""P A B S"" but P must be in 2 or 4.

Actually, let me systematically list possible combinations:

Pattern: ? ? A ? S
With P in 2 or 4.

Case 1: P in position 2 → ? P A ? S
Need first and fourth letters from remaining pool (B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and it must form a valid word.

Also none.

This suggests the only possible word is ""USPAS"" (though uncommon), or I might have missed a valid word.

Upon reflection, the valid word fitting is ""USPAS"" (an old-style rifle), despite its rarity.
