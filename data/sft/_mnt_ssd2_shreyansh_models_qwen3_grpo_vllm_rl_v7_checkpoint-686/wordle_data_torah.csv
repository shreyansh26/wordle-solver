2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to test their presence.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.
- A cannot be in the 3rd position.
- T cannot be in the 4th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and T (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoids S, L, E.
3. Avoids A in position 3 and T in position 4.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- CARTY (but Y is uncommon, and T is in position 4 which is forbidden)
- CRATE (but E is forbidden)

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with T.
- Contains R and A, but R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.
- Letters to exclude: S, L, E, M, P.

Possible positions:
- T _ _ _ _
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for words starting with T that include R and A, with no forbidden letters or positions.

Possible patterns:
- T R _ A _
- T R _ _ A
- T _ R A _
- T _ R _ A
- T _ _ R A
- T A R _ _
- T A _ R _
- T A _ _ R
- T _ A R _
- T _ A _ R
- T _ _ A R

Checking common words:
- TRA??: TRA is start of trapeze, tragi, etc. but need 5 letters.
- T?RA?: T?RA? – not many words.
- T?A?R: T?A?R – not many words.

Let me list possible candidates:
- TIGAR (but I is allowed, G is allowed, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TACIT (but C and I are allowed, but A is in position 2, T is already in 1, but word has two Ts which seems unlikely)
- TAROK (K is allowed, but A is in position 2, R is in position 2 which is forbidden because R cannot be in position 2)
- TARSI (but S is forbidden)
- TARDY (Y is allowed, but A is in position 2, R is in position 2 which is forbidden)
- TAPIR (P is forbidden)
- TIGER (E is forbidden)
- TUBAR (U, B, R – but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TONAR (N, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TIGAN (N is allowed, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TIBUR (B, U, R – but no A)
- TIZZY (Z, Y – no A or R)
- TIRAM (M is forbidden)
- TIRAS (S is forbidden)
- TIRAK (K is allowed, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)

Looking at these, the only viable candidate seems to be ""TIGAR"" but A is in position 3 which is forbidden. 

Next possible word: ""TACIT"" – but it has two Ts and A in position 2, R in position 3. This seems possible but has two Ts which is unusual.

Another candidate: ""TARDY"" – but R is in position 2 which is forbidden.

Next: ""TIBUR"" – no A.

Next: ""TIZZY"" – no A or R.

Next: ""TIGAN"" – A in position 3 forbidden.

Next: ""TIGAR"" – A in position 3 forbidden.

Next: ""TACIT"" – A in position 2, R in position 3, T in position 1, C and I allowed. This seems the best available.

But let me check if there are other words:
- T?A?R: T?A?R – ""TAWER"" (but W, E – E is forbidden)
- T?A?R: ""TABOR"" (B, O, R – but A is in position 2, R is in position 5, O is allowed. This seems possible: T A B O R)
   - Check positions: T(✓) A(?) B(?) O(?) R(?)
   - A is in position 2 – allowed (not position 3)
   - R is in position 5 – allowed (not position 2 or 4)

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TAXAR"" – but X is allowed, A in position 2, R in position 5, but word has two As which seems unlikely.

""TABOR"" seems the best available.

<guess>TABOR</guess>Based on the feedback:
- T is confirmed in position 1.
- A and R are in the word but not in their guessed positions (A not in 3, R not in 2).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to test their presence.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.
- A cannot be in the 3rd position.
- T cannot be in the 4th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and T (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoids S, L, E.
3. Avoids A in position 3 and T in position 4.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- CARTY (but Y is uncommon, and T is in position 4 which is forbidden)
- CRATE (but E is forbidden)
- PARTY (but Y is uncommon and E is forbidden)
- ATOMS (but S is forbidden)
- TAPIR (T is in position 1, A in position 2 – both allowed)
- TRAMP (T in position 1, A in position 2, no forbidden positions)
- TRACK (T in position 1, A in position 2, no forbidden positions)

""TRAMP"" seems good: T (allowed in pos 1), R, A (allowed in pos 2), M, P. No forbidden letters or positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
   - S, L, E are out.
   - A and T are in the word, but A is not in position 3 and T is not in position 4.

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T is now confirmed in position 1.
   - R and A are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - M and P are out.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with T.
- Contains R and A, but R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.
- Letters to exclude: S, L, E, M, P.

Possible positions:
- T _ _ _ _
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for words starting with T that include R and A, with no forbidden letters or positions.

Possible patterns:
- T R _ A _
- T R _ _ A
- T _ R A _
- T _ R _ A
- T _ _ R A
- T A R _ _
- T A _ R _
- T A _ _ R
- T _ A R _
- T _ A _ R
- T _ _ A R

Checking common words:
- TRA??: TRA is start of trapeze, tragi, etc. but need 5 letters.
- T?RA?: T?RA? – not many words.
- T?A?R: T?A?R – not many words.

Let me list possible candidates:
- TIGAR (but I is allowed, G is allowed, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TACIT (but C and I are allowed, but A is in position 2, T is already in 1, but word has two Ts which seems unlikely)
- TAROK (K is allowed, but A is in position 2, R is in position 2 which is forbidden because R cannot be in position 2)
- TARSI (but S is forbidden)
- TARDY (Y is allowed, but A is in position 2, R is in position 2 which is forbidden)
- TAPIR (P is forbidden)
- TIGER (E is forbidden)
- TUBAR (U, B, R – but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TONAR (N, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TIGAN (N is allowed, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)
- TIBUR (B, U, R – but no A)
- TIZZY (Z, Y – no A or R)
- TIRAM (M is forbidden)
- TIRAS (S is forbidden)
- TIRAK (K is allowed, but A is in position 3 which is forbidden)

Looking at these, the only viable candidate seems to be ""TIGAR"" but A is in position 3 which is forbidden. 

Next possible word: ""TACIT"" – but it has two Ts and A in position 2, R in position 3. This seems possible but has two Ts which is unusual.

Another candidate: ""TARDY"" – but R is in position 2 which is forbidden.

Next: ""TIBUR"" – no A.

Next: ""TIZZY"" – no A or R.

Next: ""TIGAN"" – A in position 3 forbidden.

Next: ""TIGAR"" – A in position 3 forbidden.

Next: ""TACIT"" – A in position 2, R in position 3, T in position 1, C and I allowed. This seems the best available.

But let me check if there are other words:
- T?A?R: T?A?R – ""TAWER"" (but W, E – E is forbidden)
- T?A?R: ""TABOR"" (B, O, R – but A is in position 2, R is in position 5, O is allowed. This seems possible: T A B O R)
   - Check positions: T(✓) A(?) B(?) O(?) R(?)
   - A is in position 2 – allowed (not position 3)
   - R is in position 5 – allowed (not position 2 or 4)
   - Letters: T, A, B, O, R – none are forbidden.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TAXAR"" – but X is allowed, A in position 2, R in position 5, but word has two As which seems unlikely.

""TABOR"" seems the best available.

<guess>TABOR</guess>Based on the feedback:
- T is confirmed in position 1.
- A and R are in the word but not in their guessed positions (A not in 3, R not in 2).
- Letters to exclude: S, L, E, M, P.

The word must start with T and contain A and R, with A not in position 3 and R not in position 2. A valid candidate is ""TABOR"".

   - B is out
   - O is in the word, but NOT in position 4
   - R is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew NOT in 2)

So the pattern so far:
- T _ _ _ _
- Must contain: A, R, O
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5
- O cannot be in position 4
- Letters out: S, L, E, M, P, B

Possible positions for A, R, O:
- A can be in positions 4 or 5
- R can be in positions 3 or 4
- O can be in positions 2, 3, or 5

Let's enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: A in position 4

   - Then R must be in position 3 (only remaining spot for R)
   - Then O must be in position 2 or 5
   - Position 5 cannot be O because O cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied), but position 5 is allowed
   - So possible words:
     - T O R A _
     - T _ R A O  (but O cannot be in position 5 because O is in word but not in position 4, no restriction on 5)
   - But position 5 must be filled with a letter not yet excluded. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

     - T O R A G  (TORAG - not a word)
     - T O R A H  (TORAH - valid word, meaning Bible or religious text)

Case 2: A in position 5
   - T _ _ _ A
   - Then R must be in position 3 or 4
   - O must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is A, so 2 or 3)
   - Subcase 2a: R in position 3
      - T _ R _ A
      - O must be in position 2
      - So word: T O R _ A
      - Missing letter in position 4: must be from allowed letters (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
      - Common word: T O R C A (TORCA - not common), T O R N A (Torna - valid variant of torna, but may be obscure), T O R D A (TORDA - not a word)

   - Common word: T I O R A (TIORA - not a word), T U O R A (TUORA - not a word), T H O R A (THORA - not a word), T N O R A (TNORA - not a word)

From Case 1, the most plausible valid word is ""TORAH"".

Let's verify:
- T O R A H

- A in position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- R in position 3 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
