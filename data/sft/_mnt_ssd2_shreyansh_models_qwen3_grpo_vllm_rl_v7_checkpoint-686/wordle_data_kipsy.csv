For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, which should provide good coverage for the first guess. If any of these letters are in the secret word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends in S.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4) to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test now are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A balanced next guess should:
- Keep S in the 5th position.
- Use new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoid A, R, O, E.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIS"":
- U, N, T, I are all new letters not yet tested.
- Keeps S in the correct position.
- Uses 4 new letters to maximize information gain.

However, ""UNTIS"" isn't a valid English word. A valid word that fits is ""UNTIL"" but that ends in L, not S. We need a word ending in S with new letters.

""INPUT"" is invalid (ends in T). ""MUSTY"" uses Y which is less common. ""BUNTS"" uses B, U, N, T, S - all new letters and valid.

""BUNTS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to strike or hit, and it tests B, U, N, T in positions 1-4 while keeping S in position 5.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)

   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. BUNTS → B(x) U(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   - S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
   - This directly contradicts the first feedback that said S(✓) in the 5th position.  
   - The only logical resolution is that the feedback for BUNTS was intended to show S(-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position (i.e., not 5th). Therefore, the earlier feedback must be adjusted to S(-) as well, since we cannot have S both in the 5th position and also somewhere else. This implies the feedback for AROSE's S should have been S(-) instead of S(✓), because otherwise the information is inconsistent.

However, assuming the feedback is correct as given (S(✓) in AROSE and S(-) in BUNTS), we must reconcile these. The only way both can be true is if the secret word has S in the 5th position (from AROSE) and also has S somewhere else (from BUNTS), which is impossible since S can only appear once in a 5-letter word. Therefore, the feedback for AROSE must have been a typo and should have been S(-). Proceeding under the corrected assumption that S is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So current knowledge:
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T.
- Still need to determine positions 1-4 using remaining letters.

Good remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

1. Place S in a new position (1-4).
2. Use as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid all excluded letters.

- S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T.
- Still need to determine positions 1-4 using remaining letters.

Good remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (1-4).
2. Use as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid all excluded letters.

A valid word fitting these criteria is ""CLIPS"":
- C, L, I, P are all new letters.
- S is moved to position 4.
- Word is valid and tests 4 new letters plus S in a new spot.

Let’s carefully reconcile the feedback so far.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   This says S is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 5).  

2. BUNTS → B(x) U(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   This says S is in the word but **not** in position 5.  

These two statements are contradictory. The only way both can be true is if the secret word contains the letter S **twice**, one in position 5 and one elsewhere. However, in standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat, so we cannot rule this out.

Therefore, we must accept:
- S is in the word and is in position 5 (from AROSE).
- S is also in the word but not in position 5 (from BUNTS).  
  The only resolution is that the word has two S’s, one in position 5 and one in another position (1-4).

3. CLIPS → C(x) L(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)  
   This tells us:
   - C and L are not in the word.
   - I, P, and S are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - For S, since we already know it must be in position 5, this “S(-)” means the S in position 5 is **not** the one in the correct spot, which is impossible.  
   Therefore, the feedback for AROSE must have intended S(-) instead of S(✓), because otherwise the information is internally inconsistent.

Given the impossibility of reconciling S(✓) and S(-), the most reasonable interpretation is that the first feedback was a typo and should have been S(-). Proceeding with that correction:

Current knowledge (after correction):
- S is in the word but **not** in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T, C, L.
- Letters that are in the word but whose positions are wrong: I, P, S.

So:
- S must be in positions 1-4.
- I and P are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, H, M, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (1-4).
2. Re-test I and P in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters.

A valid word: “SPICY”
- S in position 1 (new position).
- P in position 2 (was in 4, now 2).
- I in position 3 (was in 3, so need to move).
- C and Y are new letters, but C was already ruled out.  
Oops, C is already excluded.

Try “SHIMY”:
- S in 1, H new, I in 3 (same as before, bad).

Try “SHIPY” – not a word.

Try “SPICY” again but note C is out.

Better: “SPIND” – not valid.

Valid word: “SPICY” is invalid due to C.

Next: “SPYED” – E is out.

“SPRAY” – A, R out.

“SPERM” – E, R out.

“SPERM” invalid.

“SPASM” – A out.

“SPUDS” – D and second S, but double S allowed, and D new.

But we already know S must be in 1-4, and we have S in 5 from original feedback conflicting.

This shows the feedback inconsistency is critical. Given the rules, the only way to proceed is to treat the feedback as-is and realize the word must have S in position 5 (from AROSE) and also S elsewhere (from BUNTS), which implies double S. Then CLIPS feedback’s S(-) would mean the S in position 5 is not correct, which contradicts AROSE.

Therefore, the most plausible resolution is that the first feedback’s S was intended to be S(-). Proceeding with that:

Word must contain S (positions 1-4), and must contain I and P in other positions, avoiding excluded letters.

Valid word: “PIVOT” – but O, T excluded.

“SWISH” – too long.

“SHIPS” – S in 5 (forbidden by corrected knowledge), H, I, P, S.

“SHIPS” has S in 5 which we now know is wrong, so skip.

“WHIPS” – W, H, I, P, S.  
- W and H are new.
- I in 3 (was in 3, but must move).
- P in 4 (was in 4, must move).
- S in 5 (must be 1-4).

So “WHIPS” has S in 5 again – bad.

“WHISK” – K new, S in 4, I in 3, W, H new.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, which should provide good coverage for the first guess. If any of these letters are in the secret word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends in S.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4) to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test now are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A balanced next guess should:
- Keep S in the 5th position.
- Use new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoid A, R, O, E.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIS"":
- U, N, T, I are all new letters not yet tested.
- Keeps S in the correct position.
- Uses 4 new letters to maximize information gain.

However, ""UNTIS"" isn't a valid English word. A valid word that fits is ""UNTIL"" but that ends in L, not S. We need a word ending in S with new letters.

""INPUT"" is invalid (ends in T). ""MUSTY"" uses Y which is less common. ""BUNTS"" uses B, U, N, T, S - all new letters and valid.

Let’s reconcile the feedback step-by-step.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)

2. BUNTS → B(x) U(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)

   - This directly contradicts #1.

3. CLIPS → C(x) L(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)  
   - I, P, S are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   - S is NOT in position 5 (because the S in position 5 in AROSE was marked ✓, so the S in CLIPS must be referring to the same letter, making this feedback impossible).

4. WHISK → W(x) H(x) I(-) S(✓) K(-)  
   - S is in position 5 (✓), confirming #1.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - K is in the word but not in position 5.

The only consistent reading is that:
- S is in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T, C, L, W, H.
- Letters in the word but not yet placed: I, K, P (from CLIPS), and S is fixed at 5.
- From WHISK, K is in the word but not in position 5, so K is in 1-4.

So far we have:
_ _ _ _ S
with letters to place: I, K, P, and possibly others.

Remaining common letters: D, F, G, M, V, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I, K, P in positions 1-4, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- PISKY – but Y is allowed, K is allowed, I is allowed, P is allowed. Ends in Y, not S – invalid.
- PICKS – ends in S, contains P, I, C, K, S. C is excluded – invalid.
- PIVKS – not a word.
- KIPSY – ends in Y.
- KISPS – ends in S, has K, I, S, P, S – double S allowed, but only one S is needed. Valid word, but has two S’s; we already know S is in position 5, so position 1 S would be extra.

The only valid word fitting is:
- PICKS – but C is excluded.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words ending in S that contain I, K, P, and no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T, C, L, W, H.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, I, K, M, P, V, Y, S.

We need a word ending in S, with I, K, P in 1-4, and no other excluded letters.

Valid candidates:
- PISKY – ends in Y.
- PICKS – C excluded.
- PIVKS – invalid.
- KIPSY – ends in Y.
- KISPS – ends in S, contains K, I, S, P, S – valid, but double S.

The only valid word is KISPS, but it has two S’s. The rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless they’re in the excluded set, and S is allowed.

However, KISPS is a valid English word (though rare), and fits:
- Ends in S (position 5).
- Contains I, K, P in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
- No excluded letters except S which is allowed.

Thus, KISPS is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, which should provide good coverage for the first guess. If any of these letters are in the secret word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends in S.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4) to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test now are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A balanced next guess should:
- Keep S in the 5th position.
- Use new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoid A, R, O, E.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIS"":
- U, N, T, I are all new letters not yet tested.
- Keeps S in the correct position.
- Uses 4 new letters to maximize information gain.

However, ""UNTIS"" isn't a valid English word. A valid word that fits is ""UNTIL"" but that ends in L, not S. We need a word ending in S with new letters.

""INPUT"" is invalid (ends in T). ""MUSTY"" uses Y which is less common. ""BUNTS"" uses B, U, N, T, S - all new letters and valid.

""BUNTS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to strike or hit, and it tests B, U, N, T in positions 1-4 while keeping S in position 5.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   - S is in the word and is in the 5th position.  
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. BUNTS → B(x) U(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   - S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
   - This directly contradicts the first feedback that said S(✓) in the 5th position.  
   - The only logical resolution is that the feedback for BUNTS was intended to show S(-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position (i.e., not 5th). Therefore, the earlier feedback must be adjusted to S(-) as well, since we cannot have S both in the 5th position and also somewhere else. This implies the feedback for AROSE's S should have been S(-) instead of S(✓), because otherwise the information is inconsistent.

However, assuming the feedback is correct as given (S(✓) in AROSE and S(-) in BUNTS), we must reconcile these. The only way both can be true is if the secret word has S in the 5th position (from AROSE) and also has S somewhere else (from BUNTS), which is impossible since S can only appear once in a 5-letter word. Therefore, the feedback for AROSE must have been a typo and should have been S(-). Proceeding under the corrected assumption that S is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So current knowledge:
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T.
- Still need to determine positions 1-4 using remaining letters.

Good remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (1-4).
2. Use as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid all excluded letters.

A valid word fitting these criteria is ""CLIPS"":
- C, L, I, P are all new letters.
- S is moved to position 4.
- Word is valid and tests 4 new letters plus S in a new spot.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s carefully reconcile the feedback so far.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   This says S is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 5).  

2. BUNTS → B(x) U(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   This says S is in the word but **not** in position 5.  

These two statements are contradictory. The only way both can be true is if the secret word contains the letter S **twice**, one in position 5 and one elsewhere. However, in standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat, so we cannot rule this out.

Therefore, we must accept:
- S is in the word and is in position 5 (from AROSE).
- S is also in the word but not in position 5 (from BUNTS).  
  The only resolution is that the word has two S’s, one in position 5 and one in another position (1-4).

3. CLIPS → C(x) L(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)  
   This tells us:
   - C and L are not in the word.
   - I, P, and S are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - For S, since we already know it must be in position 5, this “S(-)” means the S in position 5 is **not** the one in the correct spot, which is impossible.  
   Therefore, the feedback for AROSE must have intended S(-) instead of S(✓), because otherwise the information is internally inconsistent.

Given the impossibility of reconciling S(✓) and S(-), the most reasonable interpretation is that the first feedback was a typo and should have been S(-). Proceeding with that correction:

Current knowledge (after correction):
- S is in the word but **not** in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T, C, L.
- Letters that are in the word but whose positions are wrong: I, P, S.

So:
- S must be in positions 1-4.
- I and P are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, H, M, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (1-4).
2. Re-test I and P in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters.

A valid word: “SPICY”
- S in position 1 (new position).
- P in position 2 (was in 4, now 2).
- I in position 3 (was in 3, so need to move).
- C and Y are new letters, but C was already ruled out.  
Oops, C is already excluded.

Try “SHIMY”:
- S in 1, H new, I in 3 (same as before, bad).

Try “SHIPY” – not a word.

Try “SPICY” again but note C is out.

Better: “SPIND” – not valid.

Valid word: “SPICY” is invalid due to C.

Next: “SPYED” – E is out.

“SPRAY” – A, R out.

“SPERM” – E, R out.

“SPERM” invalid.

“SPASM” – A out.

“SPUDS” – D and second S, but double S allowed, and D new.

But we already know S must be in 1-4, and we have S in 5 from original feedback conflicting.

This shows the feedback inconsistency is critical. Given the rules, the only way to proceed is to treat the feedback as-is and realize the word must have S in position 5 (from AROSE) and also S elsewhere (from BUNTS), which implies double S. Then CLIPS feedback’s S(-) would mean the S in position 5 is not correct, which contradicts AROSE.

Therefore, the most plausible resolution is that the first feedback’s S was intended to be S(-). Proceeding with that:

Word must contain S (positions 1-4), and must contain I and P in other positions, avoiding excluded letters.

Valid word: “PIVOT” – but O, T excluded.

“SWISH” – too long.

“SHIPS” – S in 5 (forbidden by corrected knowledge), H, I, P, S.

“SHIPS” has S in 5 which we now know is wrong, so skip.

“WHIPS” – W, H, I, P, S.  
- W and H are new.
- I in 3 (was in 3, but must move).
- P in 4 (was in 4, must move).
- S in 5 (must be 1-4).

So “WHIPS” has S in 5 again – bad.

“WHISK” – K new, S in 4, I in 3, W, H new.

Valid word, places S in 4, I in 3, introduces W, H.

Let’s reconcile the feedback step-by-step.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   - S is in the word and in position 5.

2. BUNTS → B(x) U(x) N(x) T(x) S(-)  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - This directly contradicts #1.

3. CLIPS → C(x) L(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)  
   - I, P, S are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   - S is NOT in position 5 (because the S in position 5 in AROSE was marked ✓, so the S in CLIPS must be referring to the same letter, making this feedback impossible).

4. WHISK → W(x) H(x) I(-) S(✓) K(-)  
   - S is in position 5 (✓), confirming #1.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - K is in the word but not in position 5.

The only consistent reading is that:
- S is in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T, C, L, W, H.
- Letters in the word but not yet placed: I, K, P (from CLIPS), and S is fixed at 5.
- From WHISK, K is in the word but not in position 5, so K is in 1-4.

So far we have:
_ _ _ _ S
with letters to place: I, K, P, and possibly others.

Remaining common letters: D, F, G, M, V, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I, K, P in positions 1-4, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- PISKY – but Y is allowed, K is allowed, I is allowed, P is allowed. Ends in Y, not S – invalid.
- PICKS – ends in S, contains P, I, C, K, S. C is excluded – invalid.
- PIVKS – not a word.
- KIPSY – ends in Y.
- KISPS – ends in S, has K, I, S, P, S – double S allowed, but only one S is needed. Valid word, but has two S’s; we already know S is in position 5, so position 1 S would be extra.

The only valid word fitting is:
- PICKS – but C is excluded.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words ending in S that contain I, K, P, and no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, R, O, E, B, U, N, T, C, L, W, H.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, I, K, M, P, V, Y, S.

We need a word ending in S, with I, K, P in 1-4, and no other excluded letters.

Valid candidates:
- PISKY – ends in Y.
- PICKS – C excluded.
- PIVKS – invalid.
- KIPSY – ends in Y.
- KISPS – ends in S, contains K, I, S, P, S – valid, but double S.

The only valid word is KISPS, but it has two S’s. The rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless they’re in the excluded set, and S is allowed.

However, KISPS is a valid English word (though rare), and fits:
- Ends in S (position 5).
- Contains I, K, P in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
- No excluded letters except S which is allowed.

Thus, KISPS is the logical next guess.
