### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and we can use the feedback to narrow down future guesses effectively.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)

   - Letters not in the word: A, O.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) S(✓)
   - Letters in the word: R, I, E, S.
   - Letters not in the word: T.
   - E is in position 4 (✓), so E is fixed at slot 4.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ E _
- Letters definitely in: R, S, I (plus E already placed).
- Letters definitely out: A, O, T.
- R cannot be in slot 2.
- S cannot be in slot 5.
- I cannot be in slot 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in slot 4.
- Contains R, S, I somewhere in the remaining slots (1, 2, 3, 5) with the position restrictions above.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, T).

Possible placements:
- R could be 1, 3, or 5.
- S could be 1, 2, or 3.
- I could be 1, 2, or 5 (since it can't be 3).

Let's try ""SIREN"":
- S in 1, I in 2, R in 3, E in 4, N in 5.
- Checks: E is in 4 (✓), R not in 2 (ok), S not in 5 (ok), I not in 3 (ok).
- Uses N, which hasn't been tested yet, giving new info.

But wait, does ""SIREN"" use all required letters? We know R, S, I, E must be present, and N is new. Actually, we don't need N yet; we just need to place R, S, I correctly with E fixed at 4.

A simpler word: ""RISEN""
- R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5.
- R not in 2 (ok), S not in 5 (ok), I not in 3 (ok), E in 4 (✓).
- Uses N again.

But maybe ""SIREN"" is fine. However, both have N which is untested. Let's try ""RIFLE"":
- R in 1, I in 2, F in 3, L in 5 (but E must be in 4).
Wait, no: pattern is _ _ _ E _, so ""RIFLE"" has E in 4, but L is new.

Actually, let's try ""RITES"":
- T is out (from TRIES), so no.

""RISEN"" seems good:
- R I S E N → positions 1,2,3,4,5.
- E is in 4 (✓), R not in 2 (ok), S not in 5 (ok), I not in 3 (ok).
- Uses N, which is new.

But we can do better: ""SIREN"" is similar. 

Another option: ""INFER"":
- I N F E R → E in 4 (✓), R in 5 (ok), S is missing. We know S must be in the word, so this is invalid.

From the new feedback on RISEN:

- R is now in the correct position 1 (✓).
- I is now in the correct position 2 (✓).
- E is already confirmed in position 4 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so S must be in position 5).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so N must be in position 3).

Therefore the word must be:
R I N E S   (positions 1,2,3,4,5)

Check constraints:
