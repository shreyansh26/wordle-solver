For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter S (but not in position 4).
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Since E is out, the remaining common vowels are I and U. Common consonants we haven’t tested yet include T, N, L, D, C, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. The word “SUNNY” is tempting, but it has two N’s and we don’t know about N yet. Instead, let’s try a word with S in position 1 and test new letters like T, I, N, L. The word “STING” uses S in position 1, T, I, N, G. However, G is less common. A better choice might be “SINUS” but it repeats S. 

Let’s go with “SINUS” to test S in positions 1 and 5, and see if I or N are in the word. Alternatively, “SITUP” is invalid. A valid word is “SITUP” but it’s not common. Instead, “STINK” is better. 

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “STINK”:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T, I, N, K are all new letters
- This tests S, T, I, N, K

Remaining common consonants: L, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We still need to place S and T correctly and fill the other three slots with unused letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter S (but not in position 4).
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Since E is out, the remaining common vowels are I and U. Common consonants we haven’t tested yet include T, N, L, D, C, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. The word “SUNNY” is tempting, but it has two N’s and we don’t know about N yet. Instead, let’s try a word with S in position 1 and test new letters like T, I, N, L. The word “STING” uses S in position 1, T, I, N, G. However, G is less common. A better choice might be “SINUS” but it repeats S. 

Let’s go with “SINUS” to test S in positions 1 and 5, and see if I or N are in the word. Alternatively, “SITUP” is invalid. A valid word is “SITUP” but it’s not common. Instead, “STINK” is better. 

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “STINK”:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T, I, N, K are all new letters
- This tests S, T, I, N, K

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, T  

So the secret word contains both S and T and none of the seven letters above.  
Remaining common vowels: U (E, I, O already eliminated)  
Remaining common consonants: L, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We still need to place S and T correctly and fill the other three slots with unused letters.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place S and T in positions we haven’t tried yet.
2. Use three fresh, frequent letters.

Positions tried so far for S: 4 (AROSE) and 1 (STINK) → remaining: 2, 3, 5  
Positions tried so far for T: 2 (STINK) → remaining: 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try:
- S in position 2
- T in position 5
- Fill the remaining three slots (1, 3, 4) with common unused letters: U, L, D

A valid word matching this pattern is “DULST” (but that’s not a common word).  
Another possibility: “LUSTS” (S at 5, T not used).  
We need both S and T present.

How about “PLUST”? Not a word.  
“BUSTS” – contains S and T, but S is at 5 (already tested) and T is at 4 (new).  
“BUSTS” has S twice – not ideal.

Try “DUSTY” – Y is uncommon.  
“GUSTS” – again S twice.

A better choice is “STUDY” but T is at 2 (already tested).

Let’s try “LUSTY” – but Y is uncommon.

Instead, let’s place S at 3 and T at 1: “T _ S _ _”.  
A valid word: “TURNS” – but N and R are eliminated.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter S (but not in position 4).
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Since E is out, the remaining common vowels are I and U. Common consonants we haven’t tested yet include T, N, L, D, C, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. The word “SUNNY” is tempting, but it has two N’s and we don’t know about N yet. Instead, let’s try a word with S in position 1 and test new letters like T, I, N, L. The word “STING” uses S in position 1, T, I, N, G. However, G is less common. A better choice might be “SINUS” but it repeats S. 

Let’s go with “SINUS” to test S in positions 1 and 5, and see if I or N are in the word. Alternatively, “SITUP” is invalid. A valid word is “SITUP” but it’s not common. Instead, “STINK” is better. 

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “STINK”:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T, I, N, K are all new letters
- This tests S, T, I, N, K

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, T  

So the secret word contains both S and T and none of the seven letters above.  
Remaining common vowels: U (E, I, O already eliminated)  
Remaining common consonants: L, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We still need to place S and T correctly and fill the other three slots with unused letters.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place S and T in positions we haven’t tried yet.
2. Use three fresh, frequent letters.

Positions tried so far for S: 4 (AROSE) and 1 (STINK) → remaining: 2, 3, 5  
Positions tried so far for T: 2 (STINK) → remaining: 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try:
- S in position 2
- T in position 5
- Fill the remaining three slots (1, 3, 4) with common unused letters: U, L, D

A valid word matching this pattern is “DULST” (but that’s not a common word).  
Another possibility: “LUSTS” (S at 5, T not used).  
We need both S and T present.

How about “PLUST”? Not a word.  
“BUSTS” – contains S and T, but S is at 5 (already tested) and T is at 4 (new).  
“BUSTS” has S twice – not ideal.

Try “DUSTY” – Y is uncommon.  
“GUSTS” – again S twice.

A better choice is “STUDY” but T is at 2 (already tested).

Let’s try “LUSTY” – but Y is uncommon.

Instead, let’s place S at 3 and T at 1: “T _ S _ _”.  
A valid word: “TURNS” – but N and R are eliminated.

“TUBES” – E eliminated.

“TULIP” – I eliminated.

“TULSA” – A eliminated.

“TULSY” – Y uncommon.

Let’s try S at 2 and T at 4: “_ S _ T _”.  
A valid word: “BUSHY” – no T.

“GUSTY” – Y uncommon.

“MUSTY” – Y uncommon.

“PUSHY” – no T.

“CUSTO” – O eliminated.

“LUSTY” – Y uncommon.

Let’s try S at 5 and T at 3: “_ _ T _ S”.  
A valid word: “BUTTS” – double T and S.

“CUTTS” – same.

“GUTTS” – no.

“LUTTS” – no.

“MUTTS” – no.

“DUTTS” – no.

Let’s try S at 2 and T at 5: “_ S _ _ T”.

“DUSKY” – Y uncommon.

“GUSKY” – no.

“LUSKY” – no.

A valid word: “TULIP” – I eliminated.

“TURNS” – N and R eliminated.

“TUBES” – E eliminated.

“TULSA” – A eliminated.

“TULSY” – Y uncommon.

“TUBST” – not a word.

“TUSKS” – K eliminated.

“TULLE” – E eliminated.

“TULIP” – I eliminated.

Let’s try S at 5 and T at 1: “T _ _ _ S”.

“TURNS” – N and R eliminated.

“TUBES” – E eliminated.

“TULSA” – A eliminated.

“TULIP” – I eliminated.

Let’s try S at 2 and T at 3: “_ S T _ _”.  
A valid word: “BUSTS” – S at 5 (already tested) and T at 3.

“CUSTS” – not a word.

“DUSTS” – not common.

“GUSTS” – S at 5 (already tested).

“LUSTS” – S at 5.

“MUSTS” – S at 5.

“PUSTS” – not a word.

“FUSTS” – not a word.

Let’s try S at 4 and T at 1: “T _ _ S _”.  
A valid word: “TULIP” – I eliminated.

“TURNS” – N and R eliminated.

“TUBES” – E eliminated.

“TULSA” – A eliminated.

“TULSY” – Y uncommon.

“TULLE” – E eliminated.

“TULIP” – I eliminated.

“TUBST” – not a word.

“TUSKS” – K eliminated.

Let’s try S at 4 and T at 5: “_ _ _ S T”.  
A valid word: “BUSTS” – S at 4, T at 5, but S is at 4 (already tested) and T at 5 is new.

“CUSTS” – not a word.

“DUSTS” – not common.

“GUSTS” – S at 4, T at 5.

“LUSTS” – S at 4, T at 5.

“MUSTS” – S at 4, T at 5.

“PUSTS” – not a word.

“FUSTS” – not a word.

Among these, “GUSTS” is a valid word, contains both S and T, and places S at 4 (new) and T at 5 (new). It uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Therefore, the next guess is “GUSTS”.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, K, G  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: S, T, U  
- Positions we have learned so far:
  – U is in position 2 (✓)  
  – T is in position 4 (✓)  
  – S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (both previous appearances were “-”).

So the pattern so far is: _ U _ T _  
with S still to be placed in position 1 or 3 (it cannot be in 3 because GUSTS showed S at 3 is wrong, and it cannot be in 5 because GUSTS showed S at 5 is correct but we already have S at 4 from T and S at 5 would conflict with T at 4). Wait, let me re-examine GUSTS feedback:

GUSTS feedback: G(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
- 1st S (position 3) is “-” → S is in word but not at 3  
- 5th letter (position 5) is S (✓) → S is in word AND in position 5  

Therefore:
- S must be at position 5  
- T is at position 4  
- U is at position 2  

Current pattern: _ U _ T S  

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, using only letters not yet eliminated (cannot use A, R, O, E, I, N, K, G). Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y …  
Remaining vowels: none left (only U used).

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 3. Let’s pick common ones that make a valid word.

Possible words fitting _ U _ T S:
- B U L T S  
- C U L T S  
- D U L T S  
- F U L T S  
- M U L T S  
- P U L T S  
- H U L T S  

Among these, “BULTS”, “CULTS”, “DULTS”, “FULTS”, “MULTS”, “PULTS”, “HULTS” – the only valid English word is “CULTS” and “MULTS”.  
“CULTS” uses C and L, both still allowed.  
“MULTS” uses M and L, also allowed.

Both are valid, but let’s pick “CULTS” first.

Check letters: C, U, L, T, S – none are in the eliminated list.

Therefore, next guess: CULTS.

From all feedback:

- Letters confirmed IN the word and locked in position:  
  – U at position 2 (✓)  
  – T at position 4 (✓)  
  – S at position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ U _ T S  

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, using only letters not yet eliminated.  
Remaining consonants (not in the banned list): B, D, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting: ? U ? T S

Possible English words:
- B U T T S – invalid (double T)  
- D U T T S – invalid  
- F U T T S – invalid  
- H U M T S – invalid  
- M U D T S – invalid  
- P U B T S – invalid  
- B U S T S – invalid (S already at 5)  
- D U B T S – invalid  
- F U B T S – invalid  
- H U B T S – invalid  
- M U B T S – invalid  
- P U B T S – invalid  

Wait, let me list actual valid English words ending in “UTS” with U in position 2 and T in position 4:

The only common one is “BUSTS”, but S is already at position 5, so position 1 would be B and position 3 would be S, but S is already used at 5 and can’t repeat (since feedback shows S only once). However, “BUSTS” has S twice, which is allowed unless previous feedback ruled it out. But previous feedback never said S appears only once, just that it’s in the word. So “BUSTS” is possible.

Check letters: B, U, S, T, S – B is still allowed, S is allowed to repeat. But we have S at 5 already, and position 3 would be S. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless previous feedback contradicts. Since GUSTS had S at 3 marked “-” (not in 3), and CULTS had no S in 3, so S can be in 3 or 5, but in GUSTS S at 3 was “-” meaning S is in word but not at 3, so S cannot be at 3. Therefore “BUSTS” is invalid because it puts S at 3.

Next possible word: “DUSTS” – same issue, S at 3.

“FUSTS” – archaic, but valid; S at 3 – invalid.

“HUSTS” – not common.

“MUSTS” – S at 3 – invalid.

“PUSTS” – not a word.

“BUTTS” – T at 4 is correct, S at 5 is correct, but T is at 4 and S at 5, so positions 1-3 would be B U T – but that would make the word B U T T S, which has T twice. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid double letters unless feedback says so. But “BUTTS” is a valid word. Let’s check:

Letters: B, U, T, T, S – B allowed, U allowed, T allowed (position 4), S allowed (position 5). No conflicts with previous feedback.

Another candidate: “BUSTY” – but Y is uncommon and T is at 4, S at 3 – invalid.

“JUITS” – J not considered (assumed no).

“QUITS” – Q not considered.

“BUTTS” appears to be the only valid English word left that fits the pattern and letter constraints.

Therefore, next guess: BUTTS.

<guess>BUTTS</guess>",BUTTS,"From all feedback:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, K, G, C, L  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and locked in position:  
  – U at position 2 (✓)  
  – T at position 4 (✓)  
  – S at position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ U _ T S  

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, using only letters not yet eliminated.  
Remaining consonants (not in the banned list): B, D, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting: ? U ? T S

Possible English words:
- B U T T S – invalid (double T)  
- D U T T S – invalid  
- F U T T S – invalid  
- H U M T S – invalid  
- M U D T S – invalid  
- P U B T S – invalid  
- B U S T S – invalid (S already at 5)  
- D U B T S – invalid  
- F U B T S – invalid  
- H U B T S – invalid  
- M U B T S – invalid  
- P U B T S – invalid  

Wait, let me list actual valid English words ending in “UTS” with U in position 2 and T in position 4:

The only common one is “BUSTS”, but S is already at position 5, so position 1 would be B and position 3 would be S, but S is already used at 5 and can’t repeat (since feedback shows S only once). However, “BUSTS” has S twice, which is allowed unless previous feedback ruled it out. But previous feedback never said S appears only once, just that it’s in the word. So “BUSTS” is possible.

Check letters: B, U, S, T, S – B is still allowed, S is allowed to repeat. But we have S at 5 already, and position 3 would be S. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless previous feedback contradicts. Since GUSTS had S at 3 marked “-” (not in 3), and CULTS had no S in 3, so S can be in 3 or 5, but in GUSTS S at 3 was “-” meaning S is in word but not at 3, so S cannot be at 3. Therefore “BUSTS” is invalid because it puts S at 3.

Next possible word: “DUSTS” – same issue, S at 3.

“FUSTS” – archaic, but valid; S at 3 – invalid.

“HUSTS” – not common.

“MUSTS” – S at 3 – invalid.

“PUSTS” – not a word.

“BUTTS” – T at 4 is correct, S at 5 is correct, but T is at 4 and S at 5, so positions 1-3 would be B U T – but that would make the word B U T T S, which has T twice. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid double letters unless feedback says so. But “BUTTS” is a valid word. Let’s check:

Letters: B, U, T, T, S – B allowed, U allowed, T allowed (position 4), S allowed (position 5). No conflicts with previous feedback.

Another candidate: “BUSTY” – but Y is uncommon and T is at 4, S at 3 – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter S (but not in position 4).
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Since E is out, the remaining common vowels are I and U. Common consonants we haven’t tested yet include T, N, L, D, C, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. The word “SUNNY” is tempting, but it has two N’s and we don’t know about N yet. Instead, let’s try a word with S in position 1 and test new letters like T, I, N, L. The word “STING” uses S in position 1, T, I, N, G. However, G is less common. A better choice might be “SINUS” but it repeats S. 

Let’s go with “SINUS” to test S in positions 1 and 5, and see if I or N are in the word. Alternatively, “SITUP” is invalid. A valid word is “SITUP” but it’s not common. Instead, “STINK” is better. 

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “STINK”:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T, I, N, K are all new letters
- This tests S, T, I, N, K

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, I, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, T  

So the secret word contains both S and T and none of the seven letters above.  
Remaining common vowels: U (E, I, O already eliminated)  
Remaining common consonants: L, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We still need to place S and T correctly and fill the other three slots with unused letters.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place S and T in positions we haven’t tried yet.
2. Use three fresh, frequent letters.

Positions tried so far for S: 4 (AROSE) and 1 (STINK) → remaining: 2, 3, 5  
Positions tried so far for T: 2 (STINK) → remaining: 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try:
- S in position 2
- T in position 5
- Fill the remaining three slots (1, 3, 4) with common unused letters: U, L, D

A valid word matching this pattern is “DULST” (but that’s not a common word).  
Another possibility: “LUSTS” (S at 5, T not used).  
We need both S and T present.

How about “PLUST”? Not a word.  
“BUSTS” – contains S and T, but S is at 5 (already tested) and T is at 4 (new).  
“BUSTS” has S twice – not ideal.

Try “DUSTY” – Y is uncommon.  
“GUSTS” – again S twice.

A better choice is “STUDY” but T is at 2 (already tested).

Let’s try “LUSTY” – but Y is uncommon.

Instead, let’s place S at 3 and T at 1: “T _ S _ _”.  
A valid word: “TURNS” – but N and R are eliminated.

“TUBES” – E eliminated.

“TULIP” – I eliminated.

“TULSA” – A eliminated.

“TULSY” – Y uncommon.

Let’s try S at 2 and T at 4: “_ S _ T _”.

“GUSTY” – Y uncommon.

“MUSTY” – Y uncommon.

“PUSHY” – no T.

“CUSTO” – O eliminated.

“LUSTY” – Y uncommon.

“CUSTS” – not a word.

“DUSTS” – not common.

“GUSTS” – S at 5 (already tested).

“LUSTS” – S at 5.

“LUSTS” – S at 4, T at 5.

“FUSTS” – not a word.

Among these, “GUSTS” is a valid word, contains both S and T, and places S at 4 (new) and T at 5 (new). It uses only letters not yet eliminated.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, K, G  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: S, T, U  
- Positions we have learned so far:
  – U is in position 2 (✓)  
  – T is in position 4 (✓)  
  – S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (both previous appearances were “-”).

So the pattern so far is: _ U _ T _  
with S still to be placed in position 1 or 3 (it cannot be in 3 because GUSTS showed S at 3 is wrong, and it cannot be in 5 because GUSTS showed S at 5 is correct but we already have S at 4 from T and S at 5 would conflict with T at 4). Wait, let me re-examine GUSTS feedback:

GUSTS feedback: G(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
- 1st S (position 3) is “-” → S is in word but not at 3  
- 5th letter (position 5) is S (✓) → S is in word AND in position 5  

Therefore:
- S must be at position 5  
- T is at position 4  
- U is at position 2  

Current pattern: _ U _ T S  

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, using only letters not yet eliminated (cannot use A, R, O, E, I, N, K, G). Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y …  
Remaining vowels: none left (only U used).

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 3. Let’s pick common ones that make a valid word.

Possible words fitting _ U _ T S:
- B U L T S  
- C U L T S  
- D U L T S  
- F U L T S  
- M U L T S  
- P U L T S  
- H U L T S  

Among these, “BULTS”, “CULTS”, “DULTS”, “FULTS”, “MULTS”, “PULTS”, “HULTS” – the only valid English word is “CULTS” and “MULTS”.  
“CULTS” uses C and L, both still allowed.  
“MULTS” uses M and L, also allowed.

Both are valid, but let’s pick “CULTS” first.

- P U B T S – invalid  

Wait, let me list actual valid English words ending in “UTS” with U in position 2 and T in position 4:

The only common one is “BUSTS”, but S is already at position 5, so position 1 would be B and position 3 would be S, but S is already used at 5 and can’t repeat (since feedback shows S only once). However, “BUSTS” has S twice, which is allowed unless previous feedback ruled it out. But previous feedback never said S appears only once, just that it’s in the word. So “BUSTS” is possible.

Check letters: B, U, S, T, S – B is still allowed, S is allowed to repeat. But we have S at 5 already, and position 3 would be S. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless previous feedback contradicts. Since GUSTS had S at 3 marked “-” (not in 3), and CULTS had no S in 3, so S can be in 3 or 5, but in GUSTS S at 3 was “-” meaning S is in word but not at 3, so S cannot be at 3. Therefore “BUSTS” is invalid because it puts S at 3.

Next possible word: “DUSTS” – same issue, S at 3.

“FUSTS” – archaic, but valid; S at 3 – invalid.

“HUSTS” – not common.

“MUSTS” – S at 3 – invalid.

“PUSTS” – not a word.

“BUTTS” – T at 4 is correct, S at 5 is correct, but T is at 4 and S at 5, so positions 1-3 would be B U T – but that would make the word B U T T S, which has T twice. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid double letters unless feedback says so. But “BUTTS” is a valid word. Let’s check:

Letters: B, U, T, T, S – B allowed, U allowed, T allowed (position 4), S allowed (position 5). No conflicts with previous feedback.
