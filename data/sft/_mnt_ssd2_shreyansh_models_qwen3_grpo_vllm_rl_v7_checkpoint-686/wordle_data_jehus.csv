For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- ARISE
- STARE

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and no repeats, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

From the three guesses we now have:

2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(x) N(x) E(-)
3. YELPS → Y(x) E(✓) L(x) P(x) S(✓)

Extracting the new information:

- E is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- Letters not in the word so far: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P.
- Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

Current known structure:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 4: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ S

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not yet eliminated (not A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P).

Let’s list remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits _ E _ _ S. Some possibilities:
- CEDIS (but I is eliminated)
- MEDIC (I eliminated)
- HEDYS (Y eliminated)
- BEGGS (but G twice, and G not confirmed)
- FUMES (U, M, E, S - E and S already placed)
- CUBES (C, U, B, E, S - E and S already placed)
- HUMPS (P eliminated)
- MUSED (E already used in position 2)
- VENOM (O, N eliminated)
- WEDGS (G not confirmed)
- CEDAR (A, R eliminated)
- BEGUM (U, M not eliminated)
- FUGUE (U, G not eliminated)
- HUMOR (O, R eliminated)
- MEDAL (A, L eliminated)
- VEGAS (A eliminated)
- CUBED (D not eliminated)
- HUBED (B, D not eliminated)
- FUMED (D not eliminated)

Looking for valid words with remaining letters:
- CUBED: C, U, B, E, D - fits _ E _ _ S? No, structure is C U B E D.
- HUBED: H, U, B, E, D - structure H U B E D.
- FUMED: F, U, M, E, D - structure F U M E D.

These all fit the pattern _ E _ _ S if we consider the last letter is S, but they are actually _ E D. So we need _ E _ _ S.

Looking again:
- MUSED: M, U, S, E, D - but S is in position 3, not 5.
- CUBED: same issue.
- HUBED: same issue.

We need words like: _ E _ _ S.

Valid words:
- CEDIS: but I is eliminated.
- MEDIC: I eliminated.
- HEDYS: Y eliminated.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: G not confirmed, but W, E, D, G, S - structure W E D G S, but G is in position 4, S in 5. This seems possible.
- HEDGS: but H, E, D, G, S - structure H E D G S, but H not yet tested.
- MEDGS: but M, E, D, G, S - structure M E D G S.

Are these valid? ""WEDGS"" is not a standard word. ""HEDGS"" is not standard. ""MEDGS"" is not standard.

Looking for standard words:
- CEDIS: not standard.
- MEDIC: standard but I eliminated.
- HEDYS: not standard.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: not standard.
- HUMPS: P eliminated.
- FUGUE: U, G, E - but structure F U G E, not _ E _ _ S.
- CUBED: structure C U B E D.
- MUSED: structure M U S E D.

Wait, we need _ E _ _ S. Let me think of words ending in ES but with E in position 2.

Actually, the structure is: position 1, E, position 3, position 4, S.

Valid words:
- CEDIS: not valid.
- MEDIC: not valid with I.
- HEDYS: not valid.
- VENOM: not valid with O, N.
- WEDGS: not valid.
- HUMPS: P eliminated.
- FUGUE: not valid.
- CUBED: not valid.
- MUSED: not valid.

Let me think differently: remaining letters are C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

Possible combinations:
- C, E, D, G, S: C E D G S - ""CEDGS"" not valid.
- M, E, D, G, S: M E D G S - ""MEDGS"" not valid.
- H, E, D, G, S: H E D G S - ""HEDGS"" not valid.
- B, E, D, G, S: B E D G S - ""BEDGS"" not valid.
- F, E, D, G, S: F E D G S - ""FEDGS"" not valid.

This seems problematic. Maybe try with other letters.

Alternative approach: use C, E, D, K, S: C E D K S - not valid.
M, E, D, K, S: M E D K S - not valid.
H, E, D, K, S: H E D K S - not valid.

Try with U:
- C, E, U, D, S: C E U D S - not valid.
- M, E, U, D, S: M E U D S - not valid.

Try with F:
- F, E, U, D, S: F E U D S - ""FEUDS"" - this is a valid word meaning ""fief"" or "" feud"".

Check letters:
- F: new, not eliminated.
- E: in position 2 (correct).
- U: new, not eliminated.
- D: new, not eliminated.
- S: in position 5 (correct).

No eliminated letters used: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P are avoided.

""FEUDS"" fits the pattern _ E _ _ S perfectly: F E U D S.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- ARISE
- STARE

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and no repeats, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or I.
- The S is NOT in position 4.
- The E is NOT in position 5.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing S and E in different positions. Good remaining common letters are T, N, L, O, C, U, D, M, P.

I’ll try a word that:
1. Keeps S and E but moves them to new positions.
2. Introduces several new high-frequency letters.
3. Avoids A, R, I.

A strong candidate is “STONE”:
- Uses S (moved to position 1) and E (moved to position 5).
- Introduces T, O, N (all common and not yet tested).
- Avoids A, R, I.

1. ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, I are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

   - T, O, N are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, T, O, N
- Positions S cannot be: 1, 4
- Positions E cannot be: 5

Remaining common letters to test: L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and E.
- S is not in positions 1 or 4.
- E is not in position 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4 (both allowed), and fill the remaining slots with new common letters.

Candidate word: ""LSEED"" – but this has two E’s and is invalid (E only appears once in the word).

Next try: ""SPELD"" – but P and L and D are new, but S is in position 1 which is invalid.

Try: ""SPYSE"" – but Y and P are new, but S is in position 1 and 4 (invalid).

Better approach: fix S in position 2 and E in position 3.

Word structure: _ S _ E _

Fill with new letters: C, L, U, D, M, P…

""USC E _"" – not working.

""USP E _"" – not working.

""USL E _"" – not working.

Let’s try ""S"" in position 3 and ""E"" in position 2.

Structure: _ E S _ _

Fill with new letters: C, L, U, D, M, P…

""ULSE S"" – not valid.

""PELKS"" – not valid.

""YELPS"" – Y, E, L, P, S. This has:
- Y, L, P new letters.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters.

""YELPS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- Letters not in the word so far: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P.
- Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

- WEDGS: G not confirmed, but W, E, D, G, S - structure W E D G S, but G is in position 4, S in 5. This seems possible.
- HEDGS: but H, E, D, G, S - structure H E D G S, but H not yet tested.
- MEDGS: but M, E, D, G, S - structure M E D G S.

Are these valid? ""WEDGS"" is not a standard word. ""HEDGS"" is not standard. ""MEDGS"" is not standard.

Looking for standard words:
- CEDIS: not standard.
- MEDIC: standard but I eliminated.
- HEDYS: not standard.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: not standard.
- HUMPS: P eliminated.
- FUGUE: U, G, E - but structure F U G E, not _ E _ _ S.
- CUBED: structure C U B E D.
- MUSED: structure M U S E D.

Wait, we need _ E _ _ S. Let me think of words ending in ES but with E in position 2.

Actually, the structure is: position 1, E, position 3, position 4, S.

Valid words:
- CEDIS: not valid.
- MEDIC: not valid with I.
- HEDYS: not valid.
- VENOM: not valid with O, N.
- WEDGS: not valid.
- HUMPS: P eliminated.
- FUGUE: not valid.
- CUBED: not valid.
- MUSED: not valid.

Let me think differently: remaining letters are C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

Possible combinations:
- C, E, D, G, S: C E D G S - ""CEDGS"" not valid.
- M, E, D, G, S: M E D G S - ""MEDGS"" not valid.
- H, E, D, G, S: H E D G S - ""HEDGS"" not valid.
- B, E, D, G, S: B E D G S - ""BEDGS"" not valid.
- F, E, D, G, S: F E D G S - ""FEDGS"" not valid.

This seems problematic. Maybe try with other letters.

Alternative approach: use C, E, D, K, S: C E D K S - not valid.
M, E, D, K, S: M E D K S - not valid.
H, E, D, K, S: H E D K S - not valid.

Try with U:
- C, E, U, D, S: C E U D S - not valid.
- M, E, U, D, S: M E U D S - not valid.

Try with F:
- F, E, U, D, S: F E U D S - ""FEUDS"" - this is a valid word meaning ""fief"" or "" feud"".

Check letters:
- F: new, not eliminated.
- E: in position 2 (correct).
- U: new, not eliminated.
- D: new, not eliminated.
- S: in position 5 (correct).

No eliminated letters used: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P are avoided.

""FEUDS"" fits the pattern _ E _ _ S perfectly: F E U D S.

<guess>FEUDS</guess>Based on the feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P.

The word must be of the form _ E _ _ S. The only valid word using remaining letters is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- ARISE
- STARE

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and no repeats, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or I.
- The S is NOT in position 4.
- The E is NOT in position 5.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing S and E in different positions. Good remaining common letters are T, N, L, O, C, U, D, M, P.

I’ll try a word that:
1. Keeps S and E but moves them to new positions.
2. Introduces several new high-frequency letters.
3. Avoids A, R, I.

A strong candidate is “STONE”:
- Uses S (moved to position 1) and E (moved to position 5).
- Introduces T, O, N (all common and not yet tested).
- Avoids A, R, I.

From the two guesses we have:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, I are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(x) N(x) E(-)
   - T, O, N are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, T, O, N
- Positions S cannot be: 1, 4
- Positions E cannot be: 5

Remaining common letters to test: L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and E.
- S is not in positions 1 or 4.
- E is not in position 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4 (both allowed), and fill the remaining slots with new common letters.

Candidate word: ""LSEED"" – but this has two E’s and is invalid (E only appears once in the word).

Next try: ""SPELD"" – but P and L and D are new, but S is in position 1 which is invalid.

Try: ""SPYSE"" – but Y and P are new, but S is in position 1 and 4 (invalid).

Better approach: fix S in position 2 and E in position 3.

Word structure: _ S _ E _

Fill with new letters: C, L, U, D, M, P…

""USC E _"" – not working.

""USP E _"" – not working.

""USL E _"" – not working.

Let’s try ""S"" in position 3 and ""E"" in position 2.

Structure: _ E S _ _

Fill with new letters: C, L, U, D, M, P…

""ULSE S"" – not valid.

""PELKS"" – not valid.

""YELPS"" – Y, E, L, P, S. This has:
- Y, L, P new letters.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters.

""YELPS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- Letters not in the word so far: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P.
- Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

Current known structure:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 4: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ S

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not yet eliminated (not A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P).

Let’s list remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits _ E _ _ S. Some possibilities:
- CEDIS (but I is eliminated)
- MEDIC (I eliminated)
- HEDYS (Y eliminated)
- BEGGS (but G twice, and G not confirmed)
- FUMES (U, M, E, S - E and S already placed)
- CUBES (C, U, B, E, S - E and S already placed)
- HUMPS (P eliminated)
- MUSED (E already used in position 2)
- VENOM (O, N eliminated)
- WEDGS (G not confirmed)
- CEDAR (A, R eliminated)
- BEGUM (U, M not eliminated)
- FUGUE (U, G not eliminated)
- HUMOR (O, R eliminated)
- MEDAL (A, L eliminated)
- VEGAS (A eliminated)
- CUBED (D not eliminated)
- HUBED (B, D not eliminated)
- FUMED (D not eliminated)

Looking for valid words with remaining letters:
- CUBED: C, U, B, E, D - fits _ E _ _ S? No, structure is C U B E D.
- HUBED: H, U, B, E, D - structure H U B E D.
- FUMED: F, U, M, E, D - structure F U M E D.

These all fit the pattern _ E _ _ S if we consider the last letter is S, but they are actually _ E D. So we need _ E _ _ S.

Looking again:
- MUSED: M, U, S, E, D - but S is in position 3, not 5.
- CUBED: same issue.
- HUBED: same issue.

We need words like: _ E _ _ S.

Valid words:
- CEDIS: but I is eliminated.
- MEDIC: I eliminated.
- HEDYS: Y eliminated.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: G not confirmed, but W, E, D, G, S - structure W E D G S, but G is in position 4, S in 5. This seems possible.
- HEDGS: but H, E, D, G, S - structure H E D G S, but H not yet tested.
- MEDGS: but M, E, D, G, S - structure M E D G S.

Are these valid? ""WEDGS"" is not a standard word. ""HEDGS"" is not standard. ""MEDGS"" is not standard.

Looking for standard words:
- CEDIS: not standard.
- MEDIC: standard but I eliminated.
- HEDYS: not standard.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: not standard.
- HUMPS: P eliminated.
- FUGUE: U, G, E - but structure F U G E, not _ E _ _ S.
- CUBED: structure C U B E D.
- MUSED: structure M U S E D.

Wait, we need _ E _ _ S. Let me think of words ending in ES but with E in position 2.

Actually, the structure is: position 1, E, position 3, position 4, S.

Valid words:
- CEDIS: not valid.
- MEDIC: not valid with I.
- HEDYS: not valid.
- VENOM: not valid with O, N.
- WEDGS: not valid.
- HUMPS: P eliminated.
- FUGUE: not valid.
- CUBED: not valid.
- MUSED: not valid.

Let me think differently: remaining letters are C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

Possible combinations:
- C, E, D, G, S: C E D G S - ""CEDGS"" not valid.
- M, E, D, G, S: M E D G S - ""MEDGS"" not valid.
- H, E, D, G, S: H E D G S - ""HEDGS"" not valid.
- B, E, D, G, S: B E D G S - ""BEDGS"" not valid.
- F, E, D, G, S: F E D G S - ""FEDGS"" not valid.

This seems problematic. Maybe try with other letters.

Alternative approach: use C, E, D, K, S: C E D K S - not valid.
M, E, D, K, S: M E D K S - not valid.
H, E, D, K, S: H E D K S - not valid.

Try with U:
- C, E, U, D, S: C E U D S - not valid.
- M, E, U, D, S: M E U D S - not valid.

Try with F:
- F, E, U, D, S: F E U D S - ""FEUDS"" - this is a valid word meaning ""fief"" or "" feud"".

Check letters:
- F: new, not eliminated.
- E: in position 2 (correct).
- U: new, not eliminated.
- D: new, not eliminated.
- S: in position 5 (correct).

No eliminated letters used: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P are avoided.

""FEUDS"" fits the pattern _ E _ _ S perfectly: F E U D S.

<guess>FEUDS</guess>Based on the feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P.

The word must be of the form _ E _ _ S. The only valid word using remaining letters is:

<guess>FEUDS</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 3: YELPS -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) E(✓) L(x) P(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: FEUDS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) U(-) D(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the four guesses we have:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(x) N(x) E(-)
3. YELPS → Y(x) E(✓) L(x) P(x) S(✓)
4. FEUDS → F(x) E(✓) U(-) D(x) S(✓)

Extracting the new information:

- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- Letters not in the word so far: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P, F, D.
- Letters still possible: B, C, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, plus any others not listed.

Current known structure:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 4: unknown, must be from remaining letters.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ S

Remaining letters available for positions 1, 3, 4: B, C, G, H, K, M, U, V, W.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ E _ _ S using only these letters.

Possible combinations:
- B, E, C, K, S → BECKS (valid word meaning ""a bribe"")
- C, E, B, K, S → CEBKS (invalid)
- H, E, C, K, S → H E C K S → ""HECKS"" (valid variant of ""hacks"")
- M, E, C, K, S → M E C K S → ""MECKS"" (valid word for ""meat cleavers"")
- C, E, G, K, S → C E G K S → ""CEGKS"" (invalid)
- B, E, G, K, S → B E G K S → ""BEGKS"" (invalid)
- C, E, B, G, S → C E B G S → ""CEBGS"" (invalid)
- M, E, B, G, S → M E B G S → ""MEBGS"" (invalid)
- H, E, B, G, S → H E B G S → ""HEBGS"" (invalid)

The valid words from the above are:
- BECKS
- HECKS
- MECKS

Among these, ""BECKS"" is the most common word meaning ""a bribe"" and uses all new letters (B, C, K). Let's choose this as the next guess.

5. BECKS → B(x) E(✓) C(x) K(x) S(✓)

Extracting the new information:

- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- Letters not in the word so far: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P, F, D, B, C, K.
- Remaining possible letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.

Current known structure:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, must be from remaining letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.
- Position 4: unknown, must be from remaining letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ S, where each blank must be filled with one of G, H, M, U, V, W.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. Let's list possible combinations:

- G, E, M, U, S → G E M U S → ""GEMUS"" (invalid)
- H, E, M, U, S → H E M U S → ""HEMUS"" (invalid)
- M, E, G, U, S → M E G U S → ""MEGUS"" (invalid)
- U, E, G, M, S → U E G M S → ""UEGMS"" (invalid)
- V, E, G, M, S → V E G M S → ""VEGMS"" (invalid)
- W, E, G, M, S → W E G M S → ""WEGMS"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual words ending in ES with E in position 2. The only remaining letters are G, H, M, U, V, W.

Possible valid words:
- HUMPS: but P is eliminated.
- MUSED: but D is eliminated.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: D, G, S - but D is eliminated.
- GEMS: but needs 5 letters.
- HEMS: but needs 5 letters.
- MEGAS: A eliminated.
- VEGAS: A eliminated.
- WEGAS: A eliminated.

Actually, the only remaining letters are G, H, M, U, V, W. Let's think of words like:

- HUGES: but G, U, E, S - structure H U G E S, but E must be in position 2.
- HUMES: but M, E, S - structure H U M E S.
- VUGES: but V, U, G, E, S - structure V U G E S.
- MUGES: but M, U, G, E, S - structure M U G E S.

""HEMUS"" is not a standard word, ""HUMES"" is valid (plural of ""hume""), ""VUGES"" is not standard, ""MUGES"" is not standard.

The most likely valid word is ""HUMES"".

Let's check:
- H: new, not eliminated.
- U: new, not eliminated.
- M: new, not eliminated.
- E: in position 2 (correct).
- S: in position 5 (correct).

This fits perfectly.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P, F, D, B, C, K.

The remaining possible letters are G, H, M, U, V, W. The only valid word fitting _ E _ _ S is:

<guess>HUMES</guess>",HUMES,"From the five guesses we now have:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(x) N(x) E(-)
3. YELPS → Y(x) E(✓) L(x) P(x) S(✓)
4. FEUDS → F(x) E(✓) U(-) D(x) S(✓)
5. BECKS → B(x) E(✓) C(x) K(x) S(✓)

Extracting the new information:

- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- Letters not in the word so far: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P, F, D, B, C, K.
- Remaining possible letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.

Current known structure:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, must be from remaining letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.
- Position 4: unknown, must be from remaining letters: G, H, M, U, V, W.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ S, where each blank must be filled with one of G, H, M, U, V, W.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. Let's list possible combinations:

- G, E, M, U, S → G E M U S → ""GEMUS"" (invalid)
- H, E, M, U, S → H E M U S → ""HEMUS"" (invalid)
- M, E, G, U, S → M E G U S → ""MEGUS"" (invalid)
- U, E, G, M, S → U E G M S → ""UEGMS"" (invalid)
- V, E, G, M, S → V E G M S → ""VEGMS"" (invalid)
- W, E, G, M, S → W E G M S → ""WEGMS"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual words ending in ES with E in position 2. The only remaining letters are G, H, M, U, V, W.

Possible valid words:
- HUMPS: but P is eliminated.
- MUSED: but D is eliminated.
- VENOM: O, N eliminated.
- WEDGS: D, G, S - but D is eliminated.
- GEMS: but needs 5 letters.
- HEMS: but needs 5 letters.
- MEGAS: A eliminated.
- VEGAS: A eliminated.
- WEGAS: A eliminated.

Actually, the only remaining letters are G, H, M, U, V, W. Let's think of words like:

- HUGES: but G, U, E, S - structure H U G E S, but E must be in position 2.
- HUMES: but M, E, S - structure H U M E S.
- VUGES: but V, U, G, E, S - structure V U G E S.
- MUGES: but M, U, G, E, S - structure M U G E S.

""HEMUS"" is not a standard word, ""HUMES"" is valid (plural of ""hume""), ""VUGES"" is not standard, ""MUGES"" is not standard.

The most likely valid word is ""HUMES"".

Let's check:
- H: new, not eliminated.
- U: new, not eliminated.
- M: new, not eliminated.
- E: in position 2 (correct).
- S: in position 5 (correct).

This fits perfectly.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, I, T, O, N, Y, L, P, F, D, B, C, K.

The remaining possible letters are G, H, M, U, V, W. The only valid word fitting _ E _ _ S is:",Guess 6: HUMES -> FEEDBACK: H(-) U(-) M(x) E(-) S(✓),FAIL
