For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us good coverage for the first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 of the most common letters, so we need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include any of those.  
Looking at the remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates are:  
- U, I, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word using five new high-frequency letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It covers two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been tested yet.

From the two guesses so far:

- AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent (x).
- UNTIL → U, T, L are absent (x); N and I are present but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and I (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the already-known N and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses N and I (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
3. Places N and I in positions different from positions 2 and 4 (respectively).

Possible structure: positions 1,3,5 can be any of the remaining letters; positions 2 and 4 must be filled from the remaining letters, but we also need to ensure N and I are in new spots.

Let’s try to place N in position 1 and I in position 3, and fill the rest with high-frequency remaining letters (C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y).

A quick scan yields “INDIC” (but C is allowed, but we have to check if it’s a valid word). However, “INDIC” is a valid word (short for indicative or relating to India). Let’s verify:
- Letters: I, N, D, I, C. But I is repeated, and we don’t know about D or C yet.
- Also, positions: N is in position 2 here, which was its previous wrong position (position 2 in UNTIL), so this would be invalid.

Better to avoid repeating positions for N and I. Let’s try “PINCH”:
- P, I, N, C, H. All letters are still allowed.
- Positions: I is in position 2 (was in position 4 before, so new), N is in position 3 (was in position 2 before, so new).
- This seems valid.

Another option is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K. All allowed letters.
- Positions: I in 3 (was in 4), N in 4 (was in 2). Valid.

Between PINCH and CHINK, PINCH uses P which is slightly more common, so I’ll go with PINCH.

From the three guesses we have:

2. UNTIL → U, T, L absent; N and I are present but in wrong positions.
3. PINCH → P, C, H absent; I is correct in position 2; N is still present but in wrong position.

So the secret word:
- Must have I in position 2 (✓).
- Must contain N, but N is NOT in position 3 (from PINCH feedback) and NOT in position 2 (already I there) and NOT in position 4 (from UNTIL feedback). So N can only be in position 1 or 5.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 of the most common letters, so we need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include any of those.  
Looking at the remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates are:  
- U, I, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word using five new high-frequency letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It covers two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next guess is:

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

- AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent (x).
- UNTIL → U, T, L are absent (x); N and I are present but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and I (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the already-known N and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses N and I (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
3. Places N and I in positions different from positions 2 and 4 (respectively).

Possible structure: positions 1,3,5 can be any of the remaining letters; positions 2 and 4 must be filled from the remaining letters, but we also need to ensure N and I are in new spots.

Let’s try to place N in position 1 and I in position 3, and fill the rest with high-frequency remaining letters (C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y).

A quick scan yields “INDIC” (but C is allowed, but we have to check if it’s a valid word). However, “INDIC” is a valid word (short for indicative or relating to India). Let’s verify:
- Letters: I, N, D, I, C. But I is repeated, and we don’t know about D or C yet.
- Also, positions: N is in position 2 here, which was its previous wrong position (position 2 in UNTIL), so this would be invalid.

Better to avoid repeating positions for N and I. Let’s try “PINCH”:
- P, I, N, C, H. All letters are still allowed.
- Positions: I is in position 2 (was in position 4 before, so new), N is in position 3 (was in position 2 before, so new).
- This seems valid.

Another option is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K. All allowed letters.
- Positions: I in 3 (was in 4), N in 4 (was in 2). Valid.

Between PINCH and CHINK, PINCH uses P which is slightly more common, so I’ll go with PINCH.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 of the most common letters, so we need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include any of those.  
Looking at the remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates are:  
- U, I, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word using five new high-frequency letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It covers two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next guess is:

<guess>UNTIL</guess>

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

- AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent (x).
- UNTIL → U, T, L are absent (x); N and I are present but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and I (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the already-known N and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses N and I (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
3. Places N and I in positions different from positions 2 and 4 (respectively).

Possible structure: positions 1,3,5 can be any of the remaining letters; positions 2 and 4 must be filled from the remaining letters, but we also need to ensure N and I are in new spots.

Let’s try to place N in position 1 and I in position 3, and fill the rest with high-frequency remaining letters (C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y).

A quick scan yields “INDIC” (but C is allowed, but we have to check if it’s a valid word). However, “INDIC” is a valid word (short for indicative or relating to India). Let’s verify:
- Letters: I, N, D, I, C. But I is repeated, and we don’t know about D or C yet.
- Also, positions: N is in position 2 here, which was its previous wrong position (position 2 in UNTIL), so this would be invalid.

Better to avoid repeating positions for N and I. Let’s try “PINCH”:
- P, I, N, C, H. All letters are still allowed.
- Positions: I is in position 2 (was in position 4 before, so new), N is in position 3 (was in position 2 before, so new).
- This seems valid.

Another option is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K. All allowed letters.
- Positions: I in 3 (was in 4), N in 4 (was in 2). Valid.

Between PINCH and CHINK, PINCH uses P which is slightly more common, so I’ll go with PINCH.

Guess 3: PINCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(-) C(x) H(x)

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.
2. UNTIL → U, T, L absent; N and I are present but in wrong positions.
3. PINCH → P, C, H absent; I is correct in position 2; N is still present but in wrong position.

So the secret word:
- Must have I in position 2 (✓).
- Must contain N, but N is NOT in position 3 (from PINCH feedback) and NOT in position 2 (already I there) and NOT in position 4 (from UNTIL feedback). So N can only be in position 1 or 5.
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, P, C, H.

Remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-known I and N.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 2.
- N in position 1 or 5.
- The other three letters from the remaining allowed set.

Let’s try N in position 1:
Word structure: N I _ _ _

We need three more letters from B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. We want common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- N I D G E → but E is excluded.
- N I D D Y → but D is repeated and Y is allowed.
- N I V E N → but E is excluded.
- N I K E D → E excluded.
- N I V A N → A excluded.

Let’s try N I V E N → invalid (E excluded).

Next, try N in position 5:
Word structure: _ I _ _ N

We need four letters from the remaining set, with N in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- B I D G N → but G is allowed, but is this a word? Not valid.
- M I D G N → not valid.
- D I M M N → not valid.
- F I V E N → but E excluded.
- K I N G N → not valid.
- M I N C N → C excluded.

Let’s think of actual words. With I in position 2, and N in position 1 or 5, and avoiding all excluded letters.

Valid words:
- N I D D Y → but D and Y are allowed, and it’s a word (slang for “niddy” or “nidge”).
- N I V E N → E excluded.
- N I K E N → E excluded.
- D I N N Y → but I must be in position 2, so this is invalid (D I N N Y has I in position 2, but N in position 3 and 4, which is invalid as N can’t be in 3 or 4).

Actually, let’s list possible words systematically:

With I in position 2:
- N I _ _ _ (N in 1)
  - N I D G E → E excluded.
  - N I V E N → E excluded.
  - N I K E D → E excluded.
  - N I V A N → A excluded.
  - N I D D Y → valid (slang), uses D, Y.

- _ I _ _ N (N in 5)
  - B I D G N → not valid.
  - D I M M N → not valid.
  - F I V E N → E excluded.
  - K I N G N → not valid.
  - M I N C N → C excluded.
  - G I V E N → E excluded.
  - V I D D N → not valid.
  - D I V E N → E excluded.

Another approach: look for actual English words with I in position 2, N in position 1 or 5, and no excluded letters.

Valid words:
- N I D D Y (slang, but valid)
- D I N N Y (but I is in position 2, N in 3 and 4 → invalid as N can’t be in 3 or 4)
- F I N N Y → N in 3 and 4 → invalid.
- K I N N Y → N in 3 and 4 → invalid.
- M I N N Y → N in 3 and 4 → invalid.

Thus, the only plausible word seems N I D D Y.

But let’s verify:
- N I D D Y: N in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (✓), D in 3, D in 4, Y in 5.
- Letters: N, I, D, Y are all allowed (no excluded letters).
- N is in position 1 (new position, not 2,3,4), which is allowed.

Therefore, NIDDY is a valid next guess.

This gives us good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  \nThat eliminates 5 of the most common letters, so we need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include any of those.  \nLooking at the remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates are:  \n- U, I, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.\n\nA balanced word using five new high-frequency letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  \nIt covers two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been tested yet.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is:\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses so far:\n\n- AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent (x).\n- UNTIL → U, T, L are absent (x); N and I are present but in wrong positions (-).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains N and I (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).\n- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.\n\nRemaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the already-known N and I.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

But I is repeated, and we don’t know about D or C yet.\n- Also, positions: N is in position 2 here, which was its previous wrong position (position 2 in UNTIL), so this would be invalid.\n\nBetter to avoid repeating positions for N and I. Let’s try “PINCH”:\n- P, I, N, C, H.
