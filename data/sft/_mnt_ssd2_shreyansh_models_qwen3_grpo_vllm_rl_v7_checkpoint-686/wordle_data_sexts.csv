- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Another candidate: “STELE” – but this repeats E in positions 2 and 5, and E in 5 is disallowed.

We need a word with S _ _ _ _ that includes both E and T, and respects the E and T constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, H, M, P, plus the remaining vowels I, U.

A balanced word that covers fresh common letters while respecting the constraints is “STEIN”:
- Contains S and E.
- Has S in position 1 (allowed, since S just can’t be in position 4).
- Has E in position 3 (allowed, since E just can’t be in position 5).
- Uses T, I, N which are all new and common.

This should give good information about the remaining letters and positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – Eliminates A, R, O.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(✓) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   – S is now fixed in position 1.
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is in the word but not in position 3.
   – I and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S _ _ _ _.
- Contains E, and E is not in positions 3 or 5.
- Contains T, and T is not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already known), U (since A, O, I are out).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing both E and T, with:
- E not in positions 3 or 5.
- T not in position 2.

Possible patterns:
S _ _ _ _ with E and T somewhere inside.

Let’s try “SHEET”:
- Starts with S.
- Has E and T.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T in position 5 (allowed, since T only can’t be in position 2).
- Uses H (new letter) and repeats E (but double letters are allowed).

However, “SHEET” has T in position 5, which is fine, but we might prefer to test T in position 3 or 4 to narrow things down more.

Another candidate: “STELE” – but this repeats E in positions 2 and 5, and E in 5 is disallowed.

Next candidate: “STUMP” – but this doesn’t contain E.

We need a word with S _ _ _ _ that includes both E and T, and respects the E and T constraints.

Let’s try “SWEET”:
- Starts with S.
- Contains E and T.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T in position 4 (allowed).
- Uses W (new letter).

This seems good – it tests T in position 4 and E in position 2, while introducing W as a new letter.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, H, M, P, plus the remaining vowels I, U.

A balanced word that covers fresh common letters while respecting the constraints is “STEIN”:
- Contains S and E.
- Has S in position 1 (allowed, since S just can’t be in position 4).
- Has E in position 3 (allowed, since E just can’t be in position 5).
- Uses T, I, N which are all new and common.

This should give good information about the remaining letters and positions.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – Eliminates A, R, O.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(✓) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   – S is now fixed in position 1.
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is in the word but not in position 3.
   – I and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S _ _ _ _.
- Contains E, and E is not in positions 3 or 5.
- Contains T, and T is not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already known), U (since A, O, I are out).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing both E and T, with:
- E not in positions 3 or 5.
- T not in position 2.

Possible patterns:
S _ _ _ _ with E and T somewhere inside.

Let’s try “SHEET”:
- Starts with S.
- Has E and T.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T in position 5 (allowed, since T only can’t be in position 2).
- Uses H (new letter) and repeats E (but double letters are allowed).

However, “SHEET” has T in position 5, which is fine, but we might prefer to test T in position 3 or 4 to narrow things down more.

Another candidate: “STELE” – but this repeats E in positions 2 and 5, and E in 5 is disallowed.

Next candidate: “STUMP” – but this doesn’t contain E.

We need a word with S _ _ _ _ that includes both E and T, and respects the E and T constraints.

Let’s try “SWEET”:
- Starts with S.
- Contains E and T.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T in position 4 (allowed).
- Uses W (new letter).

This seems good – it tests T in position 4 and E in position 2, while introducing W as a new letter.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – Eliminated: A, R, O
   – S is in the word, but not in position 4
   – E is in the word, but not in position 5

   – S is fixed in position 1
   – T is in the word, but not in position 2
   – E is in the word, but not in position 3
   – Eliminated: I, N

3. SWEET → S(✓) W(x) E(-) E(-) T(-)
   – S is fixed in position 1 (confirmed again)
   – W is not in the word
   – First E is in position 3 → but feedback says E(-) → E is not in position 3
   – Second E is in position 4 → feedback E(-) → E is not in position 4
   – T is in position 5 → feedback T(-) → T is not in position 5

So far we know:
- Word is S _ _ _ _
- Must contain: E, T
- E is NOT in positions 3, 4, 5 → E must be in position 2
- T is NOT in positions 2, 5 → T must be in position 3 or 4
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, N, W

Remaining common consonants: C, D, H, L, M, P, U, Y
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I eliminated, E is fixed in position 2)

So the pattern is:
S E _ _ _
with T in position 3 or 4, and the remaining two letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try T in position 3:
S E T _ _
We need two more letters from {C, D, H, L, M, P, U, Y}

Common endings: SET UP, SET LS, etc.
SETUP is 5 letters but starts with SE, so S E T U P → ""SETUP""

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- E(2) ✓ (only allowed position)
- T(3) ✓ (allowed position)
- U and P are new, allowed letters
- No eliminated letters used

""SETUP"" fits all constraints.

From Guess 5 (SECTS) we received:

S(✓) E(✓) C(x) T(✓) S(✓)

This tells us:

- S is correct in positions 1 and 5.
- E is correct in position 2.
- T is correct in position 4.
- C is not in the word at all.

So the pattern is now fully determined:

S E _ T S

We only need to find the correct third letter.  
Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, I, N, W, U, P, C  
Allowed remaining consonants: D, H, L, M, Y

The only 5-letter English word that fits S E _ T S is:

S E L T S  →  “SELTS” is not a valid word.  
S E D T S  →  “SEDTS” is not a word.  
S E H T S  →  “SEHTS” is not a word.  
S E M T S  →  “SEMPS” is not a word.  
S E Y T S  →  “SEYTS” is not a word.  

Wait—let’s double-check the dictionary. The only valid word that matches S E _ T S is:

S E L T S  →  Actually, “SELTS” is not recognized.  
But “SEATS” is 5 letters, yet A is eliminated.  
“SETTS” is valid (plural of “set” as in a fishing line).  

“SETTS” uses T twice, but T is already in position 4 and repetition is allowed.  
Letters: S, E, T, T, S.  
All letters are allowed (S, E, T already confirmed; no C or eliminated letters).  

Therefore, the correct word must be “SETTS”.
