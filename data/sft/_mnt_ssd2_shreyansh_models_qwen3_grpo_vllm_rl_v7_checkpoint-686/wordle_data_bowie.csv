1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. HONEY → H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is NOT in position 4 (since E(-) means it's in the word but not in position 4). We already know it's in position 5, so this is consistent.
   - H, N, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, H, N, Y
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus O and E already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except A, R, S, H, N, Y
- Has O in position 2
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not excluded so far

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern:
- BOOZE (but Z is allowed, and we have two O's - but we don't know if O repeats)
- COBIE (but I is allowed, and E is in correct spot)
- DOPEE (but P is allowed, E is correct)
- FOOEE (not a valid word)
- GOOEY (but Y is excluded)
- JOKEE (not a word)
- MOOSE (but S is excluded)
- POOER (but R is excluded)
- TOEIC (but C is allowed, I is allowed)

Looking at valid English words, ""DOPEE"" is a valid word (a slang term for a doper), but it has two E's - which might be okay if the word allows repeated letters. However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

A better choice might be ""COBIE"" - but this is a proper noun (a nickname for科比), which might not be allowed.

Another option is ""FOGIE"" - a valid word meaning a person from the Ukraine, but F and G are allowed.

But let's think of more common words. ""TOEIC"" is a test name, but that's probably not it.

Actually, ""DOPEE"" seems the closest fit with current constraints. However, since we don't know about repeated letters, maybe a word with unique letters is safer.

Looking again, ""GOOEY"" uses Y which is excluded.

""POOER"" uses R which is excluded.

""MOOSE"" uses S which is excluded.

""BOOZE"" uses Z and has two O's, but Z is allowed.

""BOOZE"" is a valid word.

But let's think of words with different letters. ""VOGUE"" - but U is allowed, G is allowed, but V is allowed.

Wait, ""VOGUE"" has:
- V (allowed)
- O (correct position 2)
- G (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- E (correct position 5)

This seems like a good choice - all letters are allowed, no excluded letters, O in position 2, E in position 5.

Let me check:
- V: not excluded
- O: correct position 2
- G: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- E: correct position 5

""VOGUE"" is a valid English word.

- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, H, N, Y
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus O and E already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except A, R, S, H, N, Y
- Has O in position 2
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not excluded so far

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern:
- BOOZE (but Z is allowed, and we have two O's - but we don't know if O repeats)
- COBIE (but I is allowed, and E is in correct spot)
- DOPEE (but P is allowed, E is correct)
- FOOEE (not a valid word)
- GOOEY (but Y is excluded)
- JOKEE (not a word)
- MOOSE (but S is excluded)
- POOER (but R is excluded)
- TOEIC (but C is allowed, I is allowed)

Looking at valid English words, ""DOPEE"" is a valid word (a slang term for a doper), but it has two E's - which might be okay if the word allows repeated letters. However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

A better choice might be ""COBIE"" - but this is a proper noun (a nickname for科比), which might not be allowed.

Another option is ""FOGIE"" - a valid word meaning a person from the Ukraine, but F and G are allowed.

But let's think of more common words. ""TOEIC"" is a test name, but that's probably not it.

Actually, ""DOPEE"" seems the closest fit with current constraints. However, since we don't know about repeated letters, maybe a word with unique letters is safer.

Looking again, ""GOOEY"" uses Y which is excluded.

""POOER"" uses R which is excluded.

""MOOSE"" uses S which is excluded.

""BOOZE"" uses Z and has two O's, but Z is allowed.

""BOOZE"" is a valid word.

But let's think of words with different letters. ""VOGUE"" - but U is allowed, G is allowed, but V is allowed.

Wait, ""VOGUE"" has:
- V (allowed)
- O (correct position 2)
- G (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- E (correct position 5)

This seems like a good choice - all letters are allowed, no excluded letters, O in position 2, E in position 5.

Let me check:
- V: not excluded
- O: correct position 2
- G: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- E: correct position 5

""VOGUE"" is a valid English word.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains O, but not in the third position.
- It does not contain A, R, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains O (not in position 3).
3. Does not contain A, R, or S.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- DOPEY (but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we don't know about Y yet)
- HONEY (but N is allowed, and Y is allowed)
- MONEY (M, N, Y allowed)
- GLOBE (but B is allowed, and we have O in position 2)
- CLOVE (C, L, V allowed)

Looking at these, ""HONEY"" seems good because:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O in position 2 (not 3).
- Does not contain A, R, or S.
- Uses common letters H, O, N, E, Y.

Another option is ""GLOBE"", but B is less common than N/Y. ""CLOVE"" uses V which is less common. ""DOPEY"" uses P and Y, which are okay but maybe less informative.

I'll go with HONEY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains O, but not in the third position.
- It does not contain A, R, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains O (not in position 3).
3. Does not contain A, R, or S.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- DOPEY (but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we don't know about Y yet)
- HONEY (but N is allowed, and Y is allowed)
- MONEY (M, N, Y allowed)
- GLOBE (but B is allowed, and we have O in position 2)
- CLOVE (C, L, V allowed)

Looking at these, ""HONEY"" seems good because:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O in position 2 (not 3).
- Does not contain A, R, or S.
- Uses common letters H, O, N, E, Y.

Another option is ""GLOBE"", but B is less common than N/Y. ""CLOVE"" uses V which is less common. ""DOPEY"" uses P and Y, which are okay but maybe less informative.

I'll go with HONEY.

Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. HONEY → H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is NOT in position 4 (since E(-) means it's in the word but not in position 4). We already know it's in position 5, so this is consistent.
   - H, N, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, H, N, Y
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus O and E already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except A, R, S, H, N, Y
- Has O in position 2
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not excluded so far

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern:
- BOOZE (but Z is allowed, and we have two O's - but we don't know if O repeats)
- COBIE (but I is allowed, and E is in correct spot)
- DOPEE (but P is allowed, E is correct)
- FOOEE (not a valid word)
- GOOEY (but Y is excluded)
- JOKEE (not a word)
- MOOSE (but S is excluded)
- POOER (but R is excluded)
- TOEIC (but C is allowed, I is allowed)

Looking at valid English words, ""DOPEE"" is a valid word (a slang term for a doper), but it has two E's - which might be okay if the word allows repeated letters. However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

A better choice might be ""COBIE"" - but this is a proper noun (a nickname for科比), which might not be allowed.

Another option is ""FOGIE"" - a valid word meaning a person from the Ukraine, but F and G are allowed.

But let's think of more common words. ""TOEIC"" is a test name, but that's probably not it.

Actually, ""DOPEE"" seems the closest fit with current constraints. However, since we don't know about repeated letters, maybe a word with unique letters is safer.

Looking again, ""GOOEY"" uses Y which is excluded.

""POOER"" uses R which is excluded.

""MOOSE"" uses S which is excluded.

""BOOZE"" uses Z and has two O's, but Z is allowed.

""BOOZE"" is a valid word.

But let's think of words with different letters. ""VOGUE"" - but U is allowed, G is allowed, but V is allowed.

Wait, ""VOGUE"" has:
- V (allowed)
- O (correct position 2)
- G (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- E (correct position 5)

This seems like a good choice - all letters are allowed, no excluded letters, O in position 2, E in position 5.

Let me check:
- V: not excluded
- O: correct position 2
- G: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- E: correct position 5

""VOGUE"" is a valid English word.

This seems like the best next guess.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Candidate words:

- COBIE – C, B, I; but “COBIE” is a proper noun (nickname for科比) and may not be accepted.

- POIE – too short.
- TOILE – T, L; but ends in E, has O in position 2, and is a valid English word (fabric).

Among these, “MOXIE” and “TOILE” are the clearest valid choices.  
“MOXIE” uses M, O, X, I, E – all allowed letters, and X is a good probe.  
“TOILE” uses T, O, I, L, E – also good, but L is slightly more common.

I’ll choose “MOXIE” because it introduces the new letter X, which will give useful information.

From the five rounds we now have:

Pattern: _ O _ _ E  
- Position 2 = O  
- Position 5 = E  

Letters known to be absent:  
A, R, S, H, N, Y, V, G, U, M, X, T, L  

Letters still allowed for positions 1, 3, 4:  
B, C, D, F, J, K, P, Q, W, Z, plus I (I is confirmed in the word but not in position 4 from TOILE feedback).

TOILE gave us:
- I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 4.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ E with I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

But from MOXIE we know I is in position 4 (✓), but TOILE says I is not in position 4 (-). This is a contradiction unless I is in the word but not in position 4, yet MOXIE said I is in position 4. This implies I must be in position 4 (✓) and TOILE's feedback for I is (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 4, which is impossible because MOXIE already placed it in position 4. This suggests I is indeed in position 4 (✓) and TOILE's (-) for I is an error in interpretation - actually, (-) means I is in the word but not in position 4, but MOXIE said I is in position 4 (✓). This is impossible unless there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, re-reading MOXIE feedback:
MOXIE: M(x) O(✓) X(x) I(✓) E(✓) → this means I is in position 4 (✓).

TOILE: T(x) O(✓) I(-) L(x) E(✓) → this means I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ E with I in position 4 (from MOXIE) and position 3 not containing I.

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ I E

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3:  
B, C, D, F, J, K, P, Q, W, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching: ? O ? I E

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common valid word is ""BOGIE"", but G is excluded. ""COBIE"" is a proper noun. ""DOZIE"" is uncommon. ""FOGIE"" uses G which is excluded. ""JOBIE"" is not a word. ""KLOIE"" is not a word. ""POIE"" is too short. ""ZOIE"" is a valid word (variant of zowie).

Thus, ""ZOIE"" is the only remaining valid word fitting _ O _ I E with allowed letters.
