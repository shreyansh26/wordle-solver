### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now know the word has no vowels A, O, E and has S somewhere except position 4. The remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet are T, L, N, I, D, U, Y, etc. A good next guess should:
1. Include S in a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U).

Possible candidates: STING, SLING, SPLIT, SWING, STUMP, SLANT, etc. I’ll pick ""STING"" because it places S in position 1, uses new common letters T, I, N, G, and includes the vowel I which hasn’t been tested yet.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, I  

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4  
- I cannot be in position 3  

We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels U, Y (and possibly D, L, etc.).  
A good next word should:
1. Place S in a new spot (positions 2 or 3 or 5).  
2. Place I in a new spot (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).  
3. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Candidate words:
- SUSHY  (but repeats S and H hasn’t been tested)  
- SLUMP  (but L and U haven’t been tested, and S in 1 is ruled out)  
- SPICY  (C and Y new, but P hasn’t been tested)  
- SWISH  (too long)  
- SHINY  (H and Y new, S in 1 is ruled out)  
- DISKS  (S in 5, I in 2, introduces D and K)

“DISKS” satisfies all constraints:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now know the word has no vowels A, O, E and has S somewhere except position 4. The remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet are T, L, N, I, D, U, Y, etc. A good next guess should:
1. Include S in a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U).

Possible candidates: STING, SLING, SPLIT, SWING, STUMP, SLANT, etc. I’ll pick ""STING"" because it places S in position 1, uses new common letters T, I, N, G, and includes the vowel I which hasn’t been tested yet.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, I  

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4  
- I cannot be in position 3  

We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels U, Y (and possibly D, L, etc.).  
A good next word should:
1. Place S in a new spot (positions 2 or 3 or 5).  
2. Place I in a new spot (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).  
3. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Candidate words:
- SUSHY  (but repeats S and H hasn’t been tested)  
- SLUMP  (but L and U haven’t been tested, and S in 1 is ruled out)  
- SPICY  (C and Y new, but P hasn’t been tested)  
- SWISH  (too long)  
- SHINY  (H and Y new, S in 1 is ruled out)  
- DISKS  (S in 5, I in 2, introduces D and K)

“DISKS” satisfies all constraints:
- S appears in positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).  
- I appears in position 2 (allowed).  
- D and K are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

So I’ll guess DISKS.

- F I L M S – valid word
- C H I L S – valid word
- P I P E S – but E is forbidden
- M I C R O S – too long
- L I V E S – E forbidden
- W I D E S – D and E forbidden
- C L I C S – valid word
- P L I S S – valid word

The most common and likely word among these is ""HILLS"". Let’s check:
- H, I, L, L, S
- I is in position 2 – ✓
- S is in position 5 – ✓
- No forbidden letters – ✓

So ""HILLS"" seems like the best next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on HILLS we now know:

- I is in position 2 (already known)
- L is in position 3 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word pattern is now: _ I L L S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, D, K, H

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ I L L S and uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible first letters (from remaining allowed set): B, C, F, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- B I L L S → ""BILLS"" – valid
- C I L L S → no such word
- F I L L S → no such word
- M I L L S → ""MILLS"" – valid
- P I L L S → no such word
- W I L L S → no such word

Between ""BILLS"" and ""MILLS"", both are valid. ""BILLS"" is more common as a starting word, but since we haven't tested B yet, we'll go with that.
