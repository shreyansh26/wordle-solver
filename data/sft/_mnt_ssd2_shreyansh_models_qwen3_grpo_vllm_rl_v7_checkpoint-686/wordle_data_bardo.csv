1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence in the word. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters across different positions. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many English words, maximizing the chance of getting hits early.

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third)
- S and E are not in the word at all.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A, R, O are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(✓)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - O is confirmed in position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ O
- Must contain R (not in position 1) and D (not in position 3).
- Cannot contain S, E, I.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is O), so 3 or 4.
Possible positions for D: 1, 2, 4 (2 is A), so 1 or 4.

If R is in position 3: word becomes _ A R _ O
   Then D must be in position 1 or 4.
   - D in 1: D A R _ O → need a letter for position 4.
   - D in 4: _ A R D O → need a letter for position 1.

If R is in position 4: word becomes _ A _ R O
   Then D must be in position 1 (since 3 is invalid for D).
   So: D A _ R O → need a letter for position 3.

Looking at common letters not yet used: T, N, L, C, M, etc.
Let's try D A R _ O with a common consonant for position 4: D A R K O (but K is okay, not used yet).
Wait, R is already in position 4, so position 3 needs a letter.

Actually, if R is in position 4, then word is _ A _ R O, and D must be in position 1: D A _ R O. Need a letter for position 3 that is common and not excluded.

Possible: D A M R O, D A N R O, D A T R O, etc.

Let me pick D A M R O - DAMRO is not a word. D A N R O - DANRO not a word. D A T R O - not a word.

Alternative: R in position 3: _ A R _ O. Then D must be in position 1 or 4.
- D A R _ O: D A R K O (DARKO - not a word)
- _ A R D O: C A R D O (CARD O - not valid)
- B A R D O (BARDO - not common)
- M A R D O (Mardo - not a word)

Hmm, let's try R in position 4: _ A _ R O. D must be in position 1: D A _ R O.
Need a valid 5-letter word: D A _ R O.
Possible: D A V R O (no), D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no), D A T R O (no).

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe D is in position 1 and R in position 3: D A R _ O.
Need a valid word: D A R _ O. Possible letters: T, N, L, etc.
D A R K O - not a word.
D A R L O - not a word.
D A R T O - not a word.

This suggests maybe R is in position 4 and D in position 1: D A _ R O.
Looking for valid words: D A _ R O.
Actually, ""DA"" is not a common start. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's list possible words fitting _ A _ _ O with A in 2 and O in 5, containing R and D:
- R must be in 3 or 4
- D must be in 1 or 4

Case 1: R in 3, D in 1: D A R _ O → need position 4 letter. Valid word: D A R K O (no), D A R T O (no), D A R L O (no).
Case 2: R in 3, D in 4: _ A R D O → need position 1 letter. Valid word: C A R D O (no), B A R D O (no), M A R D O (no).
Case 3: R in 4, D in 1: D A _ R O → need position 3 letter. Valid word: D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no).
Case 4: R in 4, D in 3: _ A D R O → but D cannot be in 3 (from RADIO feedback: D(-) means D is in word but not in position 3). So D cannot be in 3.

Thus, only possible cases are 1 and 3, but none seem to form valid words. Maybe I need to include another letter.

Wait, let's try T as a new letter. If R is in position 3: _ A R _ O, and D must be in 1 or 4.
D A R T O - not a word.
B A R D O - no.
C A R D O - no.

This seems tricky. Maybe the word is ""TARDO"" - but T is new, A in 2, R in 3, D in 4, O in 5. Check constraints:
- A in 2: ✓
- O in 5: ✓
- R in 3: allowed (not position 1)
- D in 4: allowed (not position 3)
- No S, E, I
- T is new letter

TARDO is a valid word (though rare), but let's see if there's a more common word.

Alternative: R in position 4, D in position 1: D A _ R O. Need position 3: D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no).

Another approach: Maybe the word is ""CARDO"" - but C is new, A in 2, R in 3, D in 4, O in 5. Check:
- C is new
- A in 2: ✓
- R in 3: allowed
- D in 4: allowed
- No S, E, I
- Valid word: CARDO (not common)

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe ""BARDO"" - but B is new, A in 2, R in 3, D in 4, O in 5. Valid word (Buddhist term), but obscure.

Given options, ""TARDO"" seems the closest, but let's think of others.

Wait, let's try ""GRAIL"" - no, has I which is excluded.

Actually, let's try ""RADIO"" again - but we already did that.

Re-evaluate: Maybe the word is ""RATIO"" - but I is excluded.

""RAPID"" - I excluded.

""RACON"" - O is in 5, but N is new, A in 2, R in 1 (but R cannot be in 1), so no.

""RANCH"" - O not in 5.

""RANGE"" - E excluded.

""RADON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid), D in 3 (invalid), N new.

""RADIO"" done.

""RAJON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RALLY"" - O not in 5.

""RAMON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RANDO"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RANGO"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RANJO"" - same issue.

""RATON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

This suggests R must be in position 3 or 4, and D must be in 1 or 4 accordingly.

Let's try ""TARDY"" - but Y is new, O is needed in 5, not Y.

""TA"" is not a start.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ O with A in 2 and O in 5, containing R and D:
- Must have R and D somewhere in positions 1,3,4 with constraints:
  - R not in 1
  - D not in 3
  - No S, E, I

Possible letters: T, N, L, C, M, etc.

Looking at _ A _ _ O:
- R in 3: _ A R _ O → need D in 1 or 4
  - D A R _ O: D A R K O (no), D A R T O (no), D A R L O (no)
  - _ A R D O: C A R D O (no), B A R D O (no), M A R D O (no)
- R in 4: _ A _ R O → need D in 1
  - D A _ R O: D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no), D A T R O (no)

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe I missed ""CARDO"" or ""BARDO"", but they're obscure.

Alternative: Maybe the word is ""RACON"" - but O not in 5.

Wait, let's try ""RACON"" - no, O not in 5.

""RADIO"" done.

""RAJON"" - no.

""RALLY"" - no.

""RAMON"" - no.

""RANDO"" - R in 1 invalid.

""RANGO"" - same.

""RAPID"" - I excluded.

""RATON"" - R in 1 invalid.

This suggests the only possible word is ""CARDO"" or ""BARDO"", but they're rare.

Given the constraints, ""CARDO"" seems the closest, but let's verify:
C A R D O:
- A in 2: ✓
- O in 5: ✓
- R in 3: allowed (not 1)
- D in 4: allowed (not 3)
- No S, E, I
- C is new

Thus, I'll guess CARDO.
</think>

Given the constraints:
- A is fixed in position 2
- O is fixed in position 5
- R must be in position 3 or 4
- D must be in position 1 or 4
- Cannot use S, E, I

The only valid word fitting these rules is CARDO.

<guess>CARDO</guess>",CARDO,"From the two rounds of feedback:

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is O), so 3 or 4.
Possible positions for D: 1, 2, 4 (2 is A), so 1 or 4.

If R is in position 3: word becomes _ A R _ O
   Then D must be in position 1 or 4.
   - D in 1: D A R _ O → need a letter for position 4.
   - D in 4: _ A R D O → need a letter for position 1.

If R is in position 4: word becomes _ A _ R O
   Then D must be in position 1 (since 3 is invalid for D).
   So: D A _ R O → need a letter for position 3.

Looking at common letters not yet used: T, N, L, C, M, etc.
Let's try D A R _ O with a common consonant for position 4: D A R K O (but K is okay, not used yet).
Wait, R is already in position 4, so position 3 needs a letter.

Actually, if R is in position 4, then word is _ A _ R O, and D must be in position 1: D A _ R O. Need a letter for position 3 that is common and not excluded.

Possible: D A M R O, D A N R O, D A T R O, etc.

Let me pick D A M R O - DAMRO is not a word. D A N R O - DANRO not a word. D A T R O - not a word.

Alternative: R in position 3: _ A R _ O. Then D must be in position 1 or 4.
- D A R _ O: D A R K O (DARKO - not a word)
- _ A R D O: C A R D O (CARD O - not valid)
- B A R D O (BARDO - not common)
- M A R D O (Mardo - not a word)

Hmm, let's try R in position 4: _ A _ R O. D must be in position 1: D A _ R O.
Need a valid 5-letter word: D A _ R O.
Possible: D A V R O (no), D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no), D A T R O (no).

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe D is in position 1 and R in position 3: D A R _ O.
Need a valid word: D A R _ O. Possible letters: T, N, L, etc.
D A R K O - not a word.
D A R L O - not a word.
D A R T O - not a word.

This suggests maybe R is in position 4 and D in position 1: D A _ R O.
Looking for valid words: D A _ R O.
Actually, ""DA"" is not a common start. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's list possible words fitting _ A _ _ O with A in 2 and O in 5, containing R and D:
- R must be in 3 or 4
- D must be in 1 or 4

Case 1: R in 3, D in 1: D A R _ O → need position 4 letter. Valid word: D A R K O (no), D A R T O (no), D A R L O (no).
Case 2: R in 3, D in 4: _ A R D O → need position 1 letter. Valid word: C A R D O (no), B A R D O (no), M A R D O (no).
Case 3: R in 4, D in 1: D A _ R O → need position 3 letter. Valid word: D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no).
Case 4: R in 4, D in 3: _ A D R O → but D cannot be in 3 (from RADIO feedback: D(-) means D is in word but not in position 3). So D cannot be in 3.

Thus, only possible cases are 1 and 3, but none seem to form valid words. Maybe I need to include another letter.

Wait, let's try T as a new letter. If R is in position 3: _ A R _ O, and D must be in 1 or 4.
D A R T O - not a word.
B A R D O - no.
C A R D O - no.

This seems tricky. Maybe the word is ""TARDO"" - but T is new, A in 2, R in 3, D in 4, O in 5. Check constraints:
- A in 2: ✓
- O in 5: ✓
- R in 3: allowed (not position 1)
- D in 4: allowed (not position 3)
- No S, E, I
- T is new letter

TARDO is a valid word (though rare), but let's see if there's a more common word.

Alternative: R in position 4, D in position 1: D A _ R O. Need position 3: D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no).

Another approach: Maybe the word is ""CARDO"" - but C is new, A in 2, R in 3, D in 4, O in 5. Check:
- C is new
- A in 2: ✓
- R in 3: allowed
- D in 4: allowed
- No S, E, I
- Valid word: CARDO (not common)

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe ""BARDO"" - but B is new, A in 2, R in 3, D in 4, O in 5. Valid word (Buddhist term), but obscure.

Given options, ""TARDO"" seems the closest, but let's think of others.

Wait, let's try ""GRAIL"" - no, has I which is excluded.

Actually, let's try ""RADIO"" again - but we already did that.

Re-evaluate: Maybe the word is ""RATIO"" - but I is excluded.

""RAPID"" - I excluded.

""RACON"" - O is in 5, but N is new, A in 2, R in 1 (but R cannot be in 1), so no.

""RANCH"" - O not in 5.

""RANGE"" - E excluded.

""RADON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid), D in 3 (invalid), N new.

""RADIO"" done.

""RAJON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RALLY"" - O not in 5.

""RAMON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RANDO"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RANGO"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

""RANJO"" - same issue.

""RATON"" - O in 5, A in 2, R in 1 (invalid).

This suggests R must be in position 3 or 4, and D must be in 1 or 4 accordingly.

Let's try ""TARDY"" - but Y is new, O is needed in 5, not Y.

""TA"" is not a start.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ O with A in 2 and O in 5, containing R and D:
- Must have R and D somewhere in positions 1,3,4 with constraints:
  - R not in 1
  - D not in 3
  - No S, E, I

Possible letters: T, N, L, C, M, etc.

Looking at _ A _ _ O:
- R in 3: _ A R _ O → need D in 1 or 4
  - D A R _ O: D A R K O (no), D A R T O (no), D A R L O (no)
  - _ A R D O: C A R D O (no), B A R D O (no), M A R D O (no)
- R in 4: _ A _ R O → need D in 1
  - D A _ R O: D A N R O (no), D A M R O (no), D A T R O (no)

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe I missed ""CARDO"" or ""BARDO"", but they're obscure.

Alternative: Maybe the word is ""RACON"" - but O not in 5.

Wait, let's try ""RACON"" - no, O not in 5.

""RADIO"" done.

""RAJON"" - no.

""RALLY"" - no.

""RAMON"" - no.

""RANDO"" - R in 1 invalid.

""RANGO"" - same.

""RAPID"" - I excluded.

""RATON"" - R in 1 invalid.

This suggests the only possible word is ""CARDO"" or ""BARDO"", but they're rare.

Given the constraints, ""CARDO"" seems the closest, but let's verify:
C A R D O:
- A in 2: ✓
- O in 5: ✓
- R in 3: allowed (not 1)
- D in 4: allowed (not 3)
- No S, E, I
- C is new

Thus, I'll guess CARDO.Given the constraints:
- A is fixed in position 2
- O is fixed in position 5
- R must be in position 3 or 4
- D must be in position 1 or 4
- Cannot use S, E, I

The only valid word fitting these rules is CARDO.",Guess 3: CARDO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓) O(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence in the word. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters across different positions. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many English words, maximizing the chance of getting hits early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third)
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O somewhere
- Does not contain S or E
- A is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2
- O is not in position 3

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A, R, O (since they’re confirmed)
2. Adds new common consonants that haven’t been tried yet
3. Moves A, R, O to new positions to test their correct spots
4. Avoids S and E

Good candidates: RADIO, RATIO, CARGO, RAPID, etc.

Let me pick ""RADIO"":
- Uses R, A, D, I, O
- D and I are new letters
- Positions: R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)
- Tests A in position 2, R in position 1, O in position 5
- Avoids S and E

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A, R, O are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(✓)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - O is confirmed in position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ O
- Must contain R (not in position 1) and D (not in position 3).
- Cannot contain S, E, I.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is O), so 3 or 4.
Possible positions for D: 1, 2, 4 (2 is A), so 1 or 4.

If R is in position 3: word becomes _ A R _ O
   Then D must be in position 1 or 4.
   - D in 1: D A R _ O → need a letter for position 4.
   - D in 4: _ A R D O → need a letter for position 1.

If R is in position 4: word becomes _ A _ R O
   Then D must be in position 1 (since 3 is invalid for D).
   So: D A _ R O → need a letter for position 3.

Looking at common letters not yet used: T, N, L, C, M, etc.
Let's try D A R _ O with a common consonant for position 4: D A R K O (but K is okay, not used yet).
Wait, R is already in position 4, so position 3 needs a letter.

Actually, if R is in position 4, then word is _ A _ R O, and D must be in position 1: D A _ R O. Need a letter for position 3 that is common and not excluded.

- _ A R D O: C A R D O (CARD O - not valid)
- B A R D O (BARDO - not common)

From the latest feedback:

CARDO → C(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓) O(✓)

This tells us:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- D is in position 4 (✓)
- O is in position 5 (✓)
- C is not in the word (x)

So the word pattern is now fully determined except for position 1:
_ A R D O

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ A R D O. The only common English word that fits is:

F A R D O  (but FARD is not a 5-letter word)
P A R D O  (not a word)
B A R D O  (not a word)
M A R D O  (not a word)
G A R D O  (not a word)
H A R D O  (not a word)
T A R D O  (not a word)
W A R D O  (not a word)
V A R D O  (not a word)
S A R D O  (not a word)
L A R D O  (not a word)
N A R D O  (not a word)
Z A R D O  (not a word)

Wait, the only valid word is actually:
B A R D O  (not valid)
But ""BARDO"" is a valid word (a variant of ""bardo"" from Tibetan Buddhism).

However, checking standard English dictionaries, the only valid 5-letter word matching _ A R D O is:
F A R D O  (not valid)
P A R D O  (not valid)
B A R D O  (not valid)
M A R D O  (not valid)
G A R D O  (not valid)
H A R D O  (not valid)
T A R D O  (not valid)
W A R D O  (not valid)
V A R D O  (not valid)
S A R D O  (not valid)
L A R D O  (not valid)
N A R D O  (not valid)
Z A R D O  (not valid)

This suggests the word must be ""BARDO"" (a valid variant). However, in standard Wordle lists, ""BARDO"" is accepted.

Thus, the only possible word is BARDO.

But let me double-check:
- B A R D O: B is allowed (not used before), fits all constraints.

Therefore, the correct word must be BARDO.
