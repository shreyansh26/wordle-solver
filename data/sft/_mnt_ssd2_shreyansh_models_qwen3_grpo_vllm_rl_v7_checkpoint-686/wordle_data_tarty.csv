### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and can provide good coverage for initial feedback.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _
- It contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Has A somewhere except position 3.
3. Avoids S, L, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is wrong and 4 is T).

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 1 and introduces new common consonants: “CRANT” – but that has A in position 3, which we know is wrong.  
Next try: “PARTY” – A in position 2, T in position 4, and introduces P, R, Y.  
But Y is less common, and we might prefer more consonants.

Better choice: “MARTY” – same issue with Y.  
Instead, “BRAND” – A in position 2, T in position 4, and introduces B, R, N, D.  
But A is in position 2 here, which is allowed.

Wait, let’s check: B R A N D → A is in position 3, which is invalid (from SLATE feedback A was in position 3 and marked wrong).  
So A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: “ABORT” – but O and R are fine, and T is in position 4.  
However, A in position 1 is allowed, and this introduces B, O, R.

But we might prefer to test more consonants.  
Another good option: “CARTY” – but again Y is less ideal.

Let’s pick “CRATE” – but E is excluded.  
“CRANT” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“GRANT” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“BRAND” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“FRANK” – A in position 3 (invalid).  

Let’s try A in position 5: “BIRTH” – but no A.  
“CHART” – A in position 3 (invalid).  

Best seems to be placing A in position 2:  
“PARTY” – but Y is less common.  
“BARTY” – same.  
“GRATE” – E excluded.  

Let’s go with “PARTY” anyway, as it’s a valid word and tests P, R, Y with A in position 2 and T in position 4.  
But to avoid Y, let’s try “BARTR” – not a valid word.  

Better valid word: “CRAMP” – no A.  
“BRAND” already ruled out.  

Let’s try A in position 1: “ABORT” – B, O, R, T.  
Valid word, tests B, O, R.  

I’ll go with “ABORT”.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, B, O.

   - From ABORT: R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but position 4 is already T, so irrelevant), and also NOT in position 3.
   - A was also shown NOT to be in position 1 (from ABORT feedback).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- R must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).
- T is fixed in position 4.

- Places A in position 2 (since position 5 is also possible, but let’s test it here).
- Places R in position 1 (to test that placement).
- Introduces new consonants: C, H, N, etc.

A valid word fitting these constraints is “RANCH”:
- R in position 1 (new placement for R).
- A in position 2 (new placement for A).
- N, C, H are new letters to test.
- T is not in RANCH, but we know T is in position 4, so this is fine.

Let’s check for any conflicts:

- A: not in position 1 or 3 – position 2 is okay.
- No S, L, E, B, O – these are absent.
- All letters are unique in RANCH, which is fine.

Therefore, “RANCH” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and can provide good coverage for initial feedback.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _
- It contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Has A somewhere except position 3.
3. Avoids S, L, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is wrong and 4 is T).

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 1 and introduces new common consonants: “CRANT” – but that has A in position 3, which we know is wrong.  
Next try: “PARTY” – A in position 2, T in position 4, and introduces P, R, Y.  
But Y is less common, and we might prefer more consonants.

Better choice: “MARTY” – same issue with Y.  
Instead, “BRAND” – A in position 2, T in position 4, and introduces B, R, N, D.  
But A is in position 2 here, which is allowed.

Wait, let’s check: B R A N D → A is in position 3, which is invalid (from SLATE feedback A was in position 3 and marked wrong).  
So A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: “ABORT” – but O and R are fine, and T is in position 4.  
However, A in position 1 is allowed, and this introduces B, O, R.

But we might prefer to test more consonants.  
Another good option: “CARTY” – but again Y is less ideal.

Let’s pick “CRATE” – but E is excluded.  
“CRANT” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“GRANT” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“BRAND” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“FRANK” – A in position 3 (invalid).  

Let’s try A in position 5: “BIRTH” – but no A.  
“CHART” – A in position 3 (invalid).  

Best seems to be placing A in position 2:  
“PARTY” – but Y is less common.  
“BARTY” – same.  
“GRATE” – E excluded.  

Let’s go with “PARTY” anyway, as it’s a valid word and tests P, R, Y with A in position 2 and T in position 4.  
But to avoid Y, let’s try “BARTR” – not a valid word.  

Better valid word: “CRAMP” – no A.  
“BRAND” already ruled out.  

Let’s try A in position 1: “ABORT” – B, O, R, T.  
Valid word, tests B, O, R.  

I’ll go with “ABORT”.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ T _ (T is fixed in position 4).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, B, O.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, R, T (but T is already locked in position 4).
   - From SLATE: A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - From ABORT: R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but position 4 is already T, so irrelevant), and also NOT in position 3.
   - A was also shown NOT to be in position 1 (from ABORT feedback).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- R must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).
- T is fixed in position 4.

We still need to test other common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places A in position 2 (since position 5 is also possible, but let’s test it here).
- Places R in position 1 (to test that placement).
- Introduces new consonants: C, H, N, etc.

A valid word fitting these constraints is “RANCH”:
- R in position 1 (new placement for R).
- A in position 2 (new placement for A).
- N, C, H are new letters to test.
- T is not in RANCH, but we know T is in position 4, so this is fine.

Let’s check for any conflicts:
- R: not in position 3 or 4 – position 1 is okay.
- A: not in position 1 or 3 – position 2 is okay.
- No S, L, E, B, O – these are absent.
- All letters are unique in RANCH, which is fine.

Therefore, “RANCH” is a good next guess.

Let’s list everything we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ A _ T _  
   (A is fixed in position 2, T fixed in position 4)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   S, L, E, B, O, N, C, H

3. Letters that ARE in the word (and their remaining possible positions):  
   - R  → must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)  
   - A  → already fixed in position 2  
   - T  → already fixed in position 4  

4. We still need to test other common consonants: D, F, G, K, M, P, etc.

We have the skeleton: _ A _ T _

We know R must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s try placing R in position 1 and see if we can fill the remaining slots with untested letters.

Possible word form: R A _ T _

We need a 3rd letter (position 3) and a 5th letter (position 5), chosen from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding the banned letters).

Good remaining consonants: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a pair that forms a valid English word.

- R A D T ?  → no common word  
- R A G T ?  → no common word  
- R A M T ?  → no common word  
- R A P T ?  → “RAPTY” not a word; “RAPID” but D is okay, but we already know D is untested.  
- R A V T ?  → no  
- R A W T ?  → no  

Let’s try R in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ A R T _

We need a 1st and 5th letter.

Common letters left: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

- D A R T Y → “DARTY” is not standard.  
- F A R T Y → “FARTY” is not standard.  
- G A R T ? → “GARTS” but S is banned.  
- M A R T Y → “MARTY” is a valid English name (and accepted in word lists).  
- P A R T Y → “PARTY” is valid.  

“PARTY” uses P, A, R, T, Y.  
- P and Y have not been tested yet.  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- All letters are allowed so far.

Let’s go with PARTY.

(If feedback shows P or Y are in the word, we’ll know for sure; if not, we’ll eliminate them.)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and can provide good coverage for initial feedback.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _
- It contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Has A somewhere except position 3.
3. Avoids S, L, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is wrong and 4 is T).

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 1 and introduces new common consonants: “CRANT” – but that has A in position 3, which we know is wrong.  
Next try: “PARTY” – A in position 2, T in position 4, and introduces P, R, Y.  
But Y is less common, and we might prefer more consonants.

Better choice: “MARTY” – same issue with Y.  
Instead, “BRAND” – A in position 2, T in position 4, and introduces B, R, N, D.  
But A is in position 2 here, which is allowed.

Wait, let’s check: B R A N D → A is in position 3, which is invalid (from SLATE feedback A was in position 3 and marked wrong).  
So A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: “ABORT” – but O and R are fine, and T is in position 4.  
However, A in position 1 is allowed, and this introduces B, O, R.

But we might prefer to test more consonants.  
Another good option: “CARTY” – but again Y is less ideal.

Let’s pick “CRATE” – but E is excluded.  
“CRANT” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“GRANT” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“BRAND” – A in position 3 (invalid).  
“FRANK” – A in position 3 (invalid).  

Let’s try A in position 5: “BIRTH” – but no A.  
“CHART” – A in position 3 (invalid).  

Best seems to be placing A in position 2:  
“PARTY” – but Y is less common.  
“BARTY” – same.  
“GRATE” – E excluded.  

Let’s go with “PARTY” anyway, as it’s a valid word and tests P, R, Y with A in position 2 and T in position 4.  
But to avoid Y, let’s try “BARTR” – not a valid word.  

Better valid word: “CRAMP” – no A.  
“BRAND” already ruled out.  

Let’s try A in position 1: “ABORT” – B, O, R, T.  
Valid word, tests B, O, R.  

I’ll go with “ABORT”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ T _ (T is fixed in position 4).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, B, O.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, R, T (but T is already locked in position 4).
   - From SLATE: A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - From ABORT: R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but position 4 is already T, so irrelevant), and also NOT in position 3.
   - A was also shown NOT to be in position 1 (from ABORT feedback).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- R must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).
- T is fixed in position 4.

We still need to test other common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places A in position 2 (since position 5 is also possible, but let’s test it here).
- Places R in position 1 (to test that placement).
- Introduces new consonants: C, H, N, etc.

A valid word fitting these constraints is “RANCH”:
- R in position 1 (new placement for R).
- A in position 2 (new placement for A).
- N, C, H are new letters to test.
- T is not in RANCH, but we know T is in position 4, so this is fine.

Let’s check for any conflicts:
- R: not in position 3 or 4 – position 1 is okay.
- A: not in position 1 or 3 – position 2 is okay.
- No S, L, E, B, O – these are absent.
- All letters are unique in RANCH, which is fine.

Therefore, “RANCH” is a good next guess.

Let’s try placing R in position 1 and see if we can fill the remaining slots with untested letters.

Possible word form: R A _ T _

We need a 3rd letter (position 3) and a 5th letter (position 5), chosen from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding the banned letters).

Good remaining consonants: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a pair that forms a valid English word.

- R A D T ?  → no common word  
- R A G T ?  → no common word  
- R A M T ?  → no common word  
- R A P T ?  → “RAPTY” not a word; “RAPID” but D is okay, but we already know D is untested.  
- R A V T ?  → no  
- R A W T ?  → no  

Let’s try R in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ A R T _

We need a 1st and 5th letter.

Common letters left: D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

- F A R T Y → “FARTY” is not standard.  
- G A R T ? → “GARTS” but S is banned.  
- M A R T Y → “MARTY” is a valid English name (and accepted in word lists).

“PARTY” uses P, A, R, T, Y.

We have the pattern _ A R T Y and we have tried M in position 1 and it was rejected.  
Letters already ruled out for position 1: S, L, E, B, O, N, C, H, P, M.

Remaining consonants that can legally precede A R T Y:  
D, F, G, K, V, W, (and a few rarer ones).

The only common English word that matches ? A R T Y is “DARTY” (which is listed in some dictionaries as slang or dialectal).  
However, “DARTY” is generally accepted in word-lists used for Wordle-type games.

Since every other consonant gives no valid word, we must try D.
