For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so O appears somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the fifth letter is E

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S
- O must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should keep R and E fixed, place O in a new spot, and introduce new common consonants. “ROGER” fits this: it keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests G and another R (but only one R is allowed, so that’s actually bad). Let me pick “ROUTE”: keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests U, T. Or “ROVER”: but that repeats R. Better: “ROVER” is invalid. How about “CRONE”? C is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is already there). Not good. 

“PROBE” – P, B are new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is fixed at 2). Doesn’t work. 

“FROZE” – Z is uncommon, and we don’t know about F yet. 

“GROVE” – G is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (again conflicts with R). 

“TROVE” – T is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“DROVE” – D is new, same conflict. 

“BROKE” – B, K new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“CRORE” – repeats R. 

“MORTE” – M, T new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“PORCH” – wrong length. 

“FRONT” – wrong length. 

Let me try “ROUTE”: O in position 1, R in 2, U new, T new, E in 5. This fits: _ R _ _ E with O in 1, so pattern O R _ _ E. Then U and T fill 3 and 4. “ROUTE” is valid 5-letter word. 

But wait, does “ROUTE” fit the pattern? Yes: O(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And it tests U and T. 

Another option: “GROPE” – G, P new, O in 2 (conflict with R). 

“FROPE” – same issue. 

“TROPE” – same. 

“CROPE” – same. 

“DROPE” – same. 

“BROKE” – same conflict. 

“MORPH” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length.

Based on the feedback that R and E are in their correct positions and O is in the word but not in position 3, I'll try placing O in position 1 and test new consonants U and T.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)

   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is correct in position 5

   - E is still correct in position 5
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which we already knew)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5)
   - U and T are not in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S, U, T
- O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1)
- _ R O _ E (O in 3)
- _ R _ O E (O in 4)

Let's think of valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

For _ R _ _ E:
- O must be in position 3 or 4
- Possible: _ R O _ E or _ R _ O E

Looking at common letters not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out yet)
- C R O W E
- F R O N E (but N not ruled out)
- G R O V E (V not ruled out)
- P R O N E (N not ruled out)
- C R O C E (but C repeated)
- P R O B E (B not ruled out)
- G R O I N E (but GROINE is not a valid word)

Looking at valid words:
- GROVE - G, V are new, O in 3, R in 2, E in 5
- PROBE - P, B new, O in 3
- CRONE - C new, O in 3
- BRONE - B new, O in 3
- FRONE - F new, O in 3

GROVE seems like a good choice as it tests G and V which are common.

Let's go with GROVE.

- C R O C E (but C repeated)
- P R O B E (B not ruled out)
- G R O I N E (but GROINE is not a valid word)

Looking at valid words:
- GROVE - G, V are new, O in 3, R in 2, E in 5
- PROBE - P, B new, O in 3
- CRONE - C new, O in 3
- BRONE - B new, O in 3
- FRONE - F new, O in 3

GROVE seems like a good choice as it tests G and V which are common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so O appears somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the fifth letter is E

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S
- O must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should keep R and E fixed, place O in a new spot, and introduce new common consonants. “ROGER” fits this: it keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests G and another R (but only one R is allowed, so that’s actually bad). Let me pick “ROUTE”: keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests U, T. Or “ROVER”: but that repeats R. Better: “ROVER” is invalid. How about “CRONE”? C is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is already there). Not good. 

“PROBE” – P, B are new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is fixed at 2). Doesn’t work. 

“FROZE” – Z is uncommon, and we don’t know about F yet. 

“GROVE” – G is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (again conflicts with R). 

“TROVE” – T is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“DROVE” – D is new, same conflict. 

“BROKE” – B, K new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“CRORE” – repeats R. 

“MORTE” – M, T new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“PORCH” – wrong length. 

“FRONT” – wrong length. 

Let me try “ROUTE”: O in position 1, R in 2, U new, T new, E in 5. This fits: _ R _ _ E with O in 1, so pattern O R _ _ E. Then U and T fill 3 and 4. “ROUTE” is valid 5-letter word. 

But wait, does “ROUTE” fit the pattern? Yes: O(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And it tests U and T. 

Another option: “GROPE” – G, P new, O in 2 (conflict with R). 

“FROPE” – same issue. 

“TROPE” – same. 

“CROPE” – same. 

“DROPE” – same. 

“BROKE” – same conflict. 

“MORPH” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length. 

Best seems “ROUTE”. Let me check another: “CROFT” – C, F, T new, O in 2 (conflict). 

“TROOP” – repeats O. 

“GROAN” – wrong length. 

“FROND” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length. 

“GROPE” – same conflict. 

“ROUTE” seems the best next guess.Based on the feedback that R and E are in their correct positions and O is in the word but not in position 3, I'll try placing O in position 1 and test new consonants U and T.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2
   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is correct in position 5
   - A and S are not in the word

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which we already knew)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5)
   - U and T are not in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S, U, T
- O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1)
- _ R O _ E (O in 3)
- _ R _ O E (O in 4)

Let's think of valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

For _ R _ _ E:
- O must be in position 3 or 4
- Possible: _ R O _ E or _ R _ O E

Looking at common letters not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out yet)
- C R O W E
- F R O N E (but N not ruled out)
- G R O V E (V not ruled out)
- P R O N E (N not ruled out)
- C R O C E (but C repeated)
- P R O B E (B not ruled out)
- G R O I N E (but GROINE is not a valid word)

Looking at valid words:
- GROVE - G, V are new, O in 3, R in 2, E in 5
- PROBE - P, B new, O in 3
- CRONE - C new, O in 3
- BRONE - B new, O in 3
- FRONE - F new, O in 3

GROVE seems like a good choice as it tests G and V which are common.

Let's go with GROVE.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is fixed in position 2
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - E is fixed in position 5
   - A and S are out

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in 5
   - R is NOT in position 1 (already known to be in 2)
   - O is NOT in position 2
   - U and T are out

3. GROVE → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
   - R confirmed in 2
   - O confirmed in 3 (this overrides the earlier “O is NOT in 3” from ROUTE feedback—wait, no: the ROUTE feedback said O was in the word but NOT in position 2, and AROSE said O was in the word but NOT in position 3. So O must be in position 1 or 4.)
   - E confirmed in 5
   - G and V are out

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- O must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5)
- Letters out so far: A, S, U, T, G, V
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E  (O in 1)
- _ R _ O E  (O in 4)

Let’s explore both:

1. O R _ _ E:
   - Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from remaining letters.
   - Common combinations: ORB_E, ORC_E, ORD_E, ORF_E, ORH_E, ORL_E, ORM_E, ORN_E, OP_ _E (but P is allowed)
   - Valid words: ORBIT (but T is out), ORC_E (no common word), ORDE_ (no), ORF_E (no), ORH_E (no), ORL_E (no), ORN_E (no), ORP_E (no). Seems scarce.

2. _ R _ O E:
   - Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.
   - Common words: B R I O E (but I not ruled out), C R O O E (no), D R O O E (no), F R I O E (no), H R I O E (no), L R I O E (no), M R I O E (no), N R I O E (no), P R I O E (no), W R I O E (no). 
   - Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words ending in _RO_E:
     - BRIEF → but ends in F, not E
     - CRIED → but E is fixed at 5
     - DRIED → same
     - FRIED → same
     - PROBE → but O is in 3, not 4
     - BROKE → O in 3
     - CROAK → O in 3
     - DROOL → O in 3
     - FROST → O in 3
     - GROPE → O in 3
     - PROBE → O in 3
     - TROPE → O in 3
     - All these have O in 3, which is disallowed. So _RO_E seems hard.

Alternative: Maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only remaining common words fitting _R_O_E are rare. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is _R_IO_E or similar with I.

Looking for _R_IO_E: no common word.

Looking for _R_B_O_E: no.

Wait, let me list all possible remaining letters and try combinations.

Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Pattern options:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1):
  - ORB_E: ORB_E (no common word)
  - ORC_E: no
  - ORD_E: no
  - ORF_E: no
  - ORH_E: no
  - ORL_E: no
  - ORM_E: no
  - ORN_E: no
  - ORP_E: no
  - ORW_E: no
  - ORY_E: no

- _ R _ O E (O in 4):
  - B R _ O E: BRIOE (no), BRJOE (no), BRCOE (no), BRDOE (no), BRFOE (no), BRF OE (no), BRIOE (no)
  - C R _ O E: CRI OE (no), CRJOE (no), CRCOE (no), CRDOE (no), CRFOE (no), CRHOE (no), CRIOE (no)
  - D R _ O E: same issues
  - F R _ O E: same
  - H R _ O E: same
  - L R _ O E: same
  - M R _ O E: same
  - N R _ O E: same
  - P R _ O E: same
  - W R _ O E: same

This suggests that with the remaining letters, forming a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints is difficult. Perhaps I missed a letter or combination.

Wait, let me reconsider: the constraints are:
- _ R _ _ E
- O must be in 1 or 4
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Looking for _R_O_E (O in 4):
- B R I O E (but ends in E, so BRIE is 4 letters)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None of these are valid. 

Looking for O R _ _ E (O in 1):
- O R B E _ (but must be 5 letters)
- O R B E (no)
- O R C E (no)
- O R D E (no)
- O R F E (no)
- O R H E (no)
- O R I E (no)
- O R L E (no)
- O R M E (no)
- O R N E (no)
- O R P E (no)
- O R W E (no)

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

This implies that perhaps the only remaining common word is _R_I_O_E or similar, but none fit. 

Wait, let me think of words ending in _RO_E again, but with remaining letters:
- B R O N E (but O is in 3, disallowed)
- C R O N E (same)
- D R O N E (same)
- F R O N E (same)
- P R O N E (same)
- B R O K E (O in 3)
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

All have O in 3, which is disallowed. 

This is problematic. Perhaps the word is _R_I_O_E or _R_B_O_E, but none are valid. 

Looking back, maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only possible word is O R B E (no), or _R_O_E with specific letters.

Wait, let me try:
- B R I O E (no)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None are valid. 

This suggests that the only possible word left is _R_O_E with specific letters, but none fit. 

I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From GROVE:
- G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
This shows O is in position 3 (because the third letter got ✓). This overrides the earlier ROUTE feedback that said O was NOT in position 2. So now we know:
- O is in position 3 (from GROVE feedback)
- R is in position 2
- E is in position 5
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ E

Now this is straightforward. The word is _R O _ E.

Possible words:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out)
- C R O W E
- D R O W E
- F R O N E (N not ruled out)
- P R O N E
- B R O K E
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

Valid words: BROKE, CROME, DROME, FRORE (no), PROBE, BRIKE (no), etc.

Between these, BROKE, CROME, DROME, PROBE are possible. PROBE is a valid word and tests P and B.

Let me choose PROBE.

   - Valid words: ORBIT (but T is out), ORC_E (no common word), ORDE_ (no), ORF_E (no), ORH_E (no), ORL_E (no), ORN_E (no), ORP_E (no). Seems scarce.

2. _ R _ O E:
   - Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.
   - Common words: B R I O E (but I not ruled out), C R O O E (no), D R O O E (no), F R I O E (no), H R I O E (no), L R I O E (no), M R I O E (no), N R I O E (no), P R I O E (no), W R I O E (no). 
   - Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words ending in _RO_E:
     - BRIEF → but ends in F, not E
     - CRIED → but E is fixed at 5
     - DRIED → same
     - FRIED → same
     - PROBE → but O is in 3, not 4
     - BROKE → O in 3
     - CROAK → O in 3
     - DROOL → O in 3
     - FROST → O in 3
     - GROPE → O in 3
     - PROBE → O in 3
     - TROPE → O in 3
     - All these have O in 3, which is disallowed. So _RO_E seems hard.

Alternative: Maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only remaining common words fitting _R_O_E are rare. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is _R_IO_E or similar with I.

Looking for _R_IO_E: no common word.

Looking for _R_B_O_E: no.

Wait, let me list all possible remaining letters and try combinations.

Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Pattern options:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1):
  - ORB_E: ORB_E (no common word)
  - ORC_E: no
  - ORD_E: no
  - ORF_E: no
  - ORH_E: no
  - ORL_E: no
  - ORM_E: no
  - ORN_E: no
  - ORP_E: no
  - ORW_E: no
  - ORY_E: no

- _ R _ O E (O in 4):
  - B R _ O E: BRIOE (no), BRJOE (no), BRCOE (no), BRDOE (no), BRFOE (no), BRF OE (no), BRIOE (no)
  - C R _ O E: CRI OE (no), CRJOE (no), CRCOE (no), CRDOE (no), CRFOE (no), CRHOE (no), CRIOE (no)
  - D R _ O E: same issues
  - F R _ O E: same
  - H R _ O E: same
  - L R _ O E: same
  - M R _ O E: same
  - N R _ O E: same
  - P R _ O E: same
  - W R _ O E: same

This suggests that with the remaining letters, forming a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints is difficult. Perhaps I missed a letter or combination.

Wait, let me reconsider: the constraints are:
- _ R _ _ E
- O must be in 1 or 4
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Looking for _R_O_E (O in 4):
- B R I O E (but ends in E, so BRIE is 4 letters)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None of these are valid. 

Looking for O R _ _ E (O in 1):
- O R B E _ (but must be 5 letters)
- O R B E (no)
- O R C E (no)
- O R D E (no)
- O R F E (no)
- O R H E (no)
- O R I E (no)
- O R L E (no)
- O R M E (no)
- O R N E (no)
- O R P E (no)
- O R W E (no)

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

This implies that perhaps the only remaining common word is _R_I_O_E or similar, but none fit. 

Wait, let me think of words ending in _RO_E again, but with remaining letters:
- B R O N E (but O is in 3, disallowed)
- C R O N E (same)
- D R O N E (same)
- F R O N E (same)
- P R O N E (same)
- B R O K E (O in 3)
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

All have O in 3, which is disallowed. 

This is problematic. Perhaps the word is _R_I_O_E or _R_B_O_E, but none are valid. 

Looking back, maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only possible word is O R B E (no), or _R_O_E with specific letters.

Wait, let me try:
- B R I O E (no)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None are valid. 

This suggests that the only possible word left is _R_O_E with specific letters, but none fit. 

I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From GROVE:
- G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
This shows O is in position 3 (because the third letter got ✓). This overrides the earlier ROUTE feedback that said O was NOT in position 2. So now we know:
- O is in position 3 (from GROVE feedback)
- R is in position 2
- E is in position 5
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ E

Now this is straightforward. The word is _R O _ E.

Possible words:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out)
- C R O W E
- D R O W E
- F R O N E (N not ruled out)
- P R O N E
- B R O K E
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

Valid words: BROKE, CROME, DROME, FRORE (no), PROBE, BRIKE (no), etc.

Between these, BROKE, CROME, DROME, PROBE are possible. PROBE is a valid word and tests P and B.

Let me choose PROBE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so O appears somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the fifth letter is E

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S
- O must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should keep R and E fixed, place O in a new spot, and introduce new common consonants. “ROGER” fits this: it keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests G and another R (but only one R is allowed, so that’s actually bad). Let me pick “ROUTE”: keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests U, T. Or “ROVER”: but that repeats R. Better: “ROVER” is invalid. How about “CRONE”? C is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is already there). Not good. 

“PROBE” – P, B are new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is fixed at 2). Doesn’t work. 

“FROZE” – Z is uncommon, and we don’t know about F yet. 

“GROVE” – G is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (again conflicts with R). 

“TROVE” – T is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“DROVE” – D is new, same conflict. 

“BROKE” – B, K new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“CRORE” – repeats R. 

“MORTE” – M, T new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“PORCH” – wrong length. 

“FRONT” – wrong length. 

Let me try “ROUTE”: O in position 1, R in 2, U new, T new, E in 5. This fits: _ R _ _ E with O in 1, so pattern O R _ _ E. Then U and T fill 3 and 4. “ROUTE” is valid 5-letter word. 

But wait, does “ROUTE” fit the pattern? Yes: O(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And it tests U and T. 

Another option: “GROPE” – G, P new, O in 2 (conflict with R). 

“FROPE” – same issue. 

“TROPE” – same. 

“CROPE” – same. 

“DROPE” – same. 

“BROKE” – same conflict. 

“MORPH” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length. 

Best seems “ROUTE”. Let me check another: “CROFT” – C, F, T new, O in 2 (conflict). 

“TROOP” – repeats O. 

“GROAN” – wrong length. 

“FROND” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length. 

“GROPE” – same conflict. 

“ROUTE” seems the best next guess.Based on the feedback that R and E are in their correct positions and O is in the word but not in position 3, I'll try placing O in position 1 and test new consonants U and T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2
   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is correct in position 5
   - A and S are not in the word

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which we already knew)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5)
   - U and T are not in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S, U, T
- O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1)
- _ R O _ E (O in 3)
- _ R _ O E (O in 4)

Let's think of valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

For _ R _ _ E:
- O must be in position 3 or 4
- Possible: _ R O _ E or _ R _ O E

Looking at common letters not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out yet)
- C R O W E
- F R O N E (but N not ruled out)
- G R O V E (V not ruled out)
- P R O N E (N not ruled out)
- C R O C E (but C repeated)
- P R O B E (B not ruled out)
- G R O I N E (but GROINE is not a valid word)

Looking at valid words:
- GROVE - G, V are new, O in 3, R in 2, E in 5
- PROBE - P, B new, O in 3
- CRONE - C new, O in 3
- BRONE - B new, O in 3
- FRONE - F new, O in 3

GROVE seems like a good choice as it tests G and V which are common.

Let's go with GROVE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: GROVE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is fixed in position 2
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - E is fixed in position 5
   - A and S are out

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in 5
   - R is NOT in position 1 (already known to be in 2)
   - O is NOT in position 2
   - U and T are out

3. GROVE → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
   - R confirmed in 2
   - O confirmed in 3 (this overrides the earlier “O is NOT in 3” from ROUTE feedback—wait, no: the ROUTE feedback said O was in the word but NOT in position 2, and AROSE said O was in the word but NOT in position 3. So O must be in position 1 or 4.)
   - E confirmed in 5
   - G and V are out

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- O must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5)
- Letters out so far: A, S, U, T, G, V
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E  (O in 1)
- _ R _ O E  (O in 4)

Let’s explore both:

1. O R _ _ E:
   - Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from remaining letters.
   - Common combinations: ORB_E, ORC_E, ORD_E, ORF_E, ORH_E, ORL_E, ORM_E, ORN_E, OP_ _E (but P is allowed)
   - Valid words: ORBIT (but T is out), ORC_E (no common word), ORDE_ (no), ORF_E (no), ORH_E (no), ORL_E (no), ORN_E (no), ORP_E (no). Seems scarce.

2. _ R _ O E:
   - Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.
   - Common words: B R I O E (but I not ruled out), C R O O E (no), D R O O E (no), F R I O E (no), H R I O E (no), L R I O E (no), M R I O E (no), N R I O E (no), P R I O E (no), W R I O E (no). 
   - Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words ending in _RO_E:
     - BRIEF → but ends in F, not E
     - CRIED → but E is fixed at 5
     - DRIED → same
     - FRIED → same
     - PROBE → but O is in 3, not 4
     - BROKE → O in 3
     - CROAK → O in 3
     - DROOL → O in 3
     - FROST → O in 3
     - GROPE → O in 3
     - PROBE → O in 3
     - TROPE → O in 3
     - All these have O in 3, which is disallowed. So _RO_E seems hard.

Alternative: Maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only remaining common words fitting _R_O_E are rare. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is _R_IO_E or similar with I.

Looking for _R_IO_E: no common word.

Looking for _R_B_O_E: no.

Wait, let me list all possible remaining letters and try combinations.

Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Pattern options:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1):
  - ORB_E: ORB_E (no common word)
  - ORC_E: no
  - ORD_E: no
  - ORF_E: no
  - ORH_E: no
  - ORL_E: no
  - ORM_E: no
  - ORN_E: no
  - ORP_E: no
  - ORW_E: no
  - ORY_E: no

- _ R _ O E (O in 4):
  - B R _ O E: BRIOE (no), BRJOE (no), BRCOE (no), BRDOE (no), BRFOE (no), BRF OE (no), BRIOE (no)
  - C R _ O E: CRI OE (no), CRJOE (no), CRCOE (no), CRDOE (no), CRFOE (no), CRHOE (no), CRIOE (no)
  - D R _ O E: same issues
  - F R _ O E: same
  - H R _ O E: same
  - L R _ O E: same
  - M R _ O E: same
  - N R _ O E: same
  - P R _ O E: same
  - W R _ O E: same

This suggests that with the remaining letters, forming a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints is difficult. Perhaps I missed a letter or combination.

Wait, let me reconsider: the constraints are:
- _ R _ _ E
- O must be in 1 or 4
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Looking for _R_O_E (O in 4):
- B R I O E (but ends in E, so BRIE is 4 letters)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None of these are valid. 

Looking for O R _ _ E (O in 1):
- O R B E _ (but must be 5 letters)
- O R B E (no)
- O R C E (no)
- O R D E (no)
- O R F E (no)
- O R H E (no)
- O R I E (no)
- O R L E (no)
- O R M E (no)
- O R N E (no)
- O R P E (no)
- O R W E (no)

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

This implies that perhaps the only remaining common word is _R_I_O_E or similar, but none fit. 

Wait, let me think of words ending in _RO_E again, but with remaining letters:
- B R O N E (but O is in 3, disallowed)
- C R O N E (same)
- D R O N E (same)
- F R O N E (same)
- P R O N E (same)
- B R O K E (O in 3)
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

All have O in 3, which is disallowed. 

This is problematic. Perhaps the word is _R_I_O_E or _R_B_O_E, but none are valid. 

Looking back, maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only possible word is O R B E (no), or _R_O_E with specific letters.

Wait, let me try:
- B R I O E (no)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None are valid. 

This suggests that the only possible word left is _R_O_E with specific letters, but none fit. 

I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From GROVE:
- G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
This shows O is in position 3 (because the third letter got ✓). This overrides the earlier ROUTE feedback that said O was NOT in position 2. So now we know:
- O is in position 3 (from GROVE feedback)
- R is in position 2
- E is in position 5
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ E

Now this is straightforward. The word is _R O _ E.

Possible words:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out)
- C R O W E
- D R O W E
- F R O N E (N not ruled out)
- P R O N E
- B R O K E
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

Valid words: BROKE, CROME, DROME, FRORE (no), PROBE, BRIKE (no), etc.

Between these, BROKE, CROME, DROME, PROBE are possible. PROBE is a valid word and tests P and B.

Let me choose PROBE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so O appears somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the fifth letter is E

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S
- O must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should keep R and E fixed, place O in a new spot, and introduce new common consonants. “ROGER” fits this: it keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests G and another R (but only one R is allowed, so that’s actually bad). Let me pick “ROUTE”: keeps R and E, moves O to position 1, and tests U, T. Or “ROVER”: but that repeats R. Better: “ROVER” is invalid. How about “CRONE”? C is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is already there). Not good. 

“PROBE” – P, B are new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (but R is fixed at 2). Doesn’t work. 

“FROZE” – Z is uncommon, and we don’t know about F yet. 

“GROVE” – G is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (again conflicts with R). 

“TROVE” – T is new, keeps R and E, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“DROVE” – D is new, same conflict. 

“BROKE” – B, K new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“CRORE” – repeats R. 

“MORTE” – M, T new, moves O to position 2 (conflict). 

“PORCH” – wrong length. 

“FRONT” – wrong length. 

Let me try “ROUTE”: O in position 1, R in 2, U new, T new, E in 5. This fits: _ R _ _ E with O in 1, so pattern O R _ _ E. Then U and T fill 3 and 4. “ROUTE” is valid 5-letter word. 

But wait, does “ROUTE” fit the pattern? Yes: O(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And it tests U and T. 

Another option: “GROPE” – G, P new, O in 2 (conflict with R). 

“FROPE” – same issue. 

“TROPE” – same. 

“CROPE” – same. 

“DROPE” – same. 

“BROKE” – same conflict. 

“MORPH” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length. 

Best seems “ROUTE”. Let me check another: “CROFT” – C, F, T new, O in 2 (conflict). 

“TROOP” – repeats O. 

“GROAN” – wrong length. 

“FROND” – wrong length. 

“GROIN” – wrong length. 

“GROPE” – same conflict. 

“ROUTE” seems the best next guess.Based on the feedback that R and E are in their correct positions and O is in the word but not in position 3, I'll try placing O in position 1 and test new consonants U and T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2
   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is correct in position 5
   - A and S are not in the word

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which we already knew)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5)
   - U and T are not in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in: R, O, E
- Letters definitely out: A, S, U, T
- O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Has E in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1)
- _ R O _ E (O in 3)
- _ R _ O E (O in 4)

Let's think of valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

For _ R _ _ E:
- O must be in position 3 or 4
- Possible: _ R O _ E or _ R _ O E

Looking at common letters not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out yet)
- C R O W E
- F R O N E (but N not ruled out)
- G R O V E (V not ruled out)
- P R O N E (N not ruled out)
- C R O C E (but C repeated)
- P R O B E (B not ruled out)
- G R O I N E (but GROINE is not a valid word)

Looking at valid words:
- GROVE - G, V are new, O in 3, R in 2, E in 5
- PROBE - P, B new, O in 3
- CRONE - C new, O in 3
- BRONE - B new, O in 3
- FRONE - F new, O in 3

GROVE seems like a good choice as it tests G and V which are common.

Let's go with GROVE.

Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: GROVE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is fixed in position 2
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - E is fixed in position 5
   - A and S are out

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in 5
   - R is NOT in position 1 (already known to be in 2)
   - O is NOT in position 2
   - U and T are out

3. GROVE → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
   - R confirmed in 2
   - O confirmed in 3 (this overrides the earlier “O is NOT in 3” from ROUTE feedback—wait, no: the ROUTE feedback said O was in the word but NOT in position 2, and AROSE said O was in the word but NOT in position 3. So O must be in position 1 or 4.)
   - E confirmed in 5
   - G and V are out

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- O must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5)
- Letters out so far: A, S, U, T, G, V
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Possible patterns:
- O R _ _ E  (O in 1)
- _ R _ O E  (O in 4)

Let’s explore both:

1. O R _ _ E:
   - Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from remaining letters.
   - Common combinations: ORB_E, ORC_E, ORD_E, ORF_E, ORH_E, ORL_E, ORM_E, ORN_E, OP_ _E (but P is allowed)
   - Valid words: ORBIT (but T is out), ORC_E (no common word), ORDE_ (no), ORF_E (no), ORH_E (no), ORL_E (no), ORN_E (no), ORP_E (no). Seems scarce.

2. _ R _ O E:
   - Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.
   - Common words: B R I O E (but I not ruled out), C R O O E (no), D R O O E (no), F R I O E (no), H R I O E (no), L R I O E (no), M R I O E (no), N R I O E (no), P R I O E (no), W R I O E (no). 
   - Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words ending in _RO_E:
     - BRIEF → but ends in F, not E
     - CRIED → but E is fixed at 5
     - DRIED → same
     - FRIED → same
     - PROBE → but O is in 3, not 4
     - BROKE → O in 3
     - CROAK → O in 3
     - DROOL → O in 3
     - FROST → O in 3
     - GROPE → O in 3
     - PROBE → O in 3
     - TROPE → O in 3
     - All these have O in 3, which is disallowed. So _RO_E seems hard.

Alternative: Maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only remaining common words fitting _R_O_E are rare. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is _R_IO_E or similar with I.

Looking for _R_IO_E: no common word.

Looking for _R_B_O_E: no.

Wait, let me list all possible remaining letters and try combinations.

Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Pattern options:
- O R _ _ E (O in 1):
  - ORB_E: ORB_E (no common word)
  - ORC_E: no
  - ORD_E: no
  - ORF_E: no
  - ORH_E: no
  - ORL_E: no
  - ORM_E: no
  - ORN_E: no
  - ORP_E: no
  - ORW_E: no
  - ORY_E: no

- _ R _ O E (O in 4):
  - B R _ O E: BRIOE (no), BRJOE (no), BRCOE (no), BRDOE (no), BRFOE (no), BRF OE (no), BRIOE (no)
  - C R _ O E: CRI OE (no), CRJOE (no), CRCOE (no), CRDOE (no), CRFOE (no), CRHOE (no), CRIOE (no)
  - D R _ O E: same issues
  - F R _ O E: same
  - H R _ O E: same
  - L R _ O E: same
  - M R _ O E: same
  - N R _ O E: same
  - P R _ O E: same
  - W R _ O E: same

This suggests that with the remaining letters, forming a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints is difficult. Perhaps I missed a letter or combination.

Wait, let me reconsider: the constraints are:
- _ R _ _ E
- O must be in 1 or 4
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Looking for _R_O_E (O in 4):
- B R I O E (but ends in E, so BRIE is 4 letters)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None of these are valid. 

Looking for O R _ _ E (O in 1):
- O R B E _ (but must be 5 letters)
- O R B E (no)
- O R C E (no)
- O R D E (no)
- O R F E (no)
- O R H E (no)
- O R I E (no)
- O R L E (no)
- O R M E (no)
- O R N E (no)
- O R P E (no)
- O R W E (no)

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

This implies that perhaps the only remaining common word is _R_I_O_E or similar, but none fit. 

Wait, let me think of words ending in _RO_E again, but with remaining letters:
- B R O N E (but O is in 3, disallowed)
- C R O N E (same)
- D R O N E (same)
- F R O N E (same)
- P R O N E (same)
- B R O K E (O in 3)
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

All have O in 3, which is disallowed. 

This is problematic. Perhaps the word is _R_I_O_E or _R_B_O_E, but none are valid. 

Looking back, maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only possible word is O R B E (no), or _R_O_E with specific letters.

Wait, let me try:
- B R I O E (no)
- C R I O E (no)
- D R I O E (no)
- F R I O E (no)
- H R I O E (no)
- L R I O E (no)
- M R I O E (no)
- N R I O E (no)
- P R I O E (no)
- W R I O E (no)

None are valid. 

This suggests that the only possible word left is _R_O_E with specific letters, but none fit. 

I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From GROVE:
- G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
This shows O is in position 3 (because the third letter got ✓). This overrides the earlier ROUTE feedback that said O was NOT in position 2. So now we know:
- O is in position 3 (from GROVE feedback)
- R is in position 2
- E is in position 5
- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ E

Now this is straightforward. The word is _R O _ E.

Possible words:
- B R O W E (but W not ruled out)
- C R O W E
- D R O W E
- F R O N E (N not ruled out)
- P R O N E
- B R O K E
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- P R O K E (no)

Valid words: BROKE, CROME, DROME, FRORE (no), PROBE, BRIKE (no), etc.

Between these, BROKE, CROME, DROME, PROBE are possible. PROBE is a valid word and tests P and B.

Let me choose PROBE.

<guess>PROBE</guess>After re-evaluating the feedback, the pattern is now clear: _ R O _ E. The only remaining letters to test are for positions 1 and 4.

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern so far: _ R O _ E
   - Letters out: A, S

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - U and T are out
   - Confirms E in 5, R in 2, O in 3

3. GROVE → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
   - G and V are out

4. PROBE → P(x) R(✓) O(✓) B(x) E(✓)
   - P and B are out

So the pattern is fixed at: _ R O _ E  
Letters already ruled out for position 1: A, G, P, S, U, T, V, B  
Letters still allowed for position 1: C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z  

Letters allowed for position 4: any letter not yet ruled out (except those already used in wrong positions).

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ E:

- C R O W E (W allowed)
- D R O W E
- F R O N E (N allowed)
- H R O N E (no such word)
- L R O N E (no)
- M R O N E (no)
- N R O N E (no)
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)
- F R O K E (no)
- C R O F E (no)
- C R O D E (no)
- C R O L E (no)
- C R O M E (no)
- C R O I E (no)
- C R O J E (no)
- C R O Y E (no)
- C R O Z E (no)

The only common valid word left is CROME (short for chromium), but it's uncommon. The next is DROME (a variant spelling of drôme, also uncommon). The most common valid word is FRORE, but that's archaic. The next is WROTE, but T is out. 

Looking again, the word must be _ R O _ E with allowed letters. The only common valid word is FRORE, but it's not standard. 

Wait, let me list remaining letters for position 1: C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 4: same letters except those already ruled out (A, S, U, T, G, V, P, B).

Common words:
- C R O W E (W allowed)
- D R O W E
- F R O N E (N allowed)
- C R O N E (N allowed)
- D R O N E (N allowed)
- F R O K E (K allowed)
- C R O K E (no)
- D R O K E (no)

Valid words:
- CRONE
- DROVE (but V is out)
- FROZE (Z allowed, but E is in 5, so FROZE is _ R O _ E → F R O Z E)
- WROTE (T is out)
- CROME (no)
- DROME (no)

Between these, the valid options are:
- CRONE
- FROZE

CRONE is a valid word (ancient coin), FROZE is valid. Let's choose CRONE as it's more common.

But wait, let me check:
- CRONE: C R O N E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-O, 4-N, 5-E
- DROZE: D R O Z E
- FROZE: F R O Z E

All fit. CRONE is the most common.

Seems scarce.\n\n2. _ R _ O E:\n   - Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.\n   - Common words: B R I O E (but I not ruled out), C R O O E (no), D R O O E (no), F R I O E (no), H R I O E (no), L R I O E (no), M R I O E (no), N R I O E (no), P R I O E (no), W R I O E (no). \n   - Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words ending in _RO_E:\n     - BRIEF → but ends in F, not E\n     - CRIED → but E is fixed at 5\n     - DRIED → same\n     - FRIED → same\n     - PROBE → but O is in 3, not 4\n     - BROKE → O in 3\n     - CROAK → O in 3\n     - DROOL → O in 3\n     - FROST → O in 3\n     - GROPE → O in 3\n     - PROBE → O in 3\n     - TROPE → O in 3\n     - All these have O in 3, which is disallowed. So _RO_E seems hard.\n\nAlternative: Maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only remaining common words fitting _R_O_E are rare. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is _R_IO_E or similar with I.\n\nLooking for _R_IO_E: no common word.\n\nLooking for _R_B_O_E: no.\n\nWait, let me list all possible remaining letters and try combinations.\n\nLetters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z\n\nPattern options:\n- O R _ _ E (O in 1):\n  - ORB_E: ORB_E (no common word)\n  - ORC_E: no\n  - ORD_E: no\n  - ORF_E: no\n  - ORH_E: no\n  - ORL_E: no\n  - ORM_E: no\n  - ORN_E: no\n  - ORP_E: no\n  - ORW_E: no\n  - ORY_E: no\n\n- _ R _ O E (O in 4):\n  - B R _ O E: BRIOE (no), BRJOE (no), BRCOE (no), BRDOE (no), BRFOE (no), BRF OE (no), BRIOE (no)\n  - C R _ O E: CRI OE (no), CRJOE (no), CRCOE (no), CRDOE (no), CRFOE (no), CRHOE (no), CRIOE (no)\n  - D R _ O E: same issues\n  - F R _ O E: same\n  - H R _ O E: same\n  - L R _ O E: same\n  - M R _ O E: same\n  - N R _ O E: same\n  - P R _ O E: same\n  - W R _ O E: same\n\nThis suggests that with the remaining letters, forming a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints is difficult. Perhaps I missed a letter or combination.\n\nWait, let me reconsider: the constraints are:\n- _ R _ _ E\n- O must be in 1 or 4\n- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V\n\nLooking for _R_O_E (O in 4):\n- B R I O E (but ends in E, so BRIE is 4 letters)\n- C R I O E (no)\n- D R I O E (no)\n- F R I O E (no)\n- H R I O E (no)\n- L R I O E (no)\n- M R I O E (no)\n- N R I O E (no)\n- P R I O E (no)\n- W R I O E (no)\n\nNone of these are valid. \n\nLooking for O R _ _ E (O in 1):\n- O R B E _ (but must be 5 letters)\n- O R B E (no)\n- O R C E (no)\n- O R D E (no)\n- O R F E (no)\n- O R H E (no)\n- O R I E (no)\n- O R L E (no)\n- O R M E (no)\n- O R N E (no)\n- O R P E (no)\n- O R W E (no)\n\nNone of these are valid 5-letter words.\n\nThis implies that perhaps the only remaining common word is _R_I_O_E or similar, but none fit. \n\nWait, let me think of words ending in _RO_E again, but with remaining letters:\n- B R O N E (but O is in 3, disallowed)\n- C R O N E (same)\n- D R O N E (same)\n- F R O N E (same)\n- P R O N E (same)\n- B R O K E (O in 3)\n- C R O K E (no)\n- D R O K E (no)\n- F R O K E (no)\n- P R O K E (no)\n\nAll have O in 3, which is disallowed. \n\nThis is problematic. Perhaps the word is _R_I_O_E or _R_B_O_E, but none are valid. \n\nLooking back, maybe I missed that O must be in 1 or 4, and the only possible word is O R B E (no), or _R_O_E with specific letters.\n\nWait, let me try:\n- B R I O E (no)\n- C R I O E (no)\n- D R I O E (no)\n- F R I O E (no)\n- H R I O E (no)\n- L R I O E (no)\n- M R I O E (no)\n- N R I O E (no)\n- P R I O E (no)\n- W R I O E (no)\n\nNone are valid. \n\nThis suggests that the only possible word left is _R_O_E with specific letters, but none fit. \n\nI must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback:\n\nFrom GROVE:\n- G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)\nThis shows O is in position 3 (because the third letter got ✓). This overrides the earlier ROUTE feedback that said O was NOT in position 2. So now we know:\n- O is in position 3 (from GROVE feedback)\n- R is in position 2\n- E is in position 5\n- Letters out: A, S, U, T, G, V\n\nThus the pattern is: _ R O _ E\n\nNow this is straightforward. The word is _R O _ E.\n\nPossible words:\n- B R O W E (but W not ruled out)\n- C R O W E\n- D R O W E\n- F R O N E (N not ruled out)\n- P R O N E\n- B R O K E\n- C R O K E (no)\n- D R O K E (no)\n- F R O K E (no)\n- P R O K E (no)\n\nValid words: BROKE, CROME, DROME, FRORE (no), PROBE, BRIKE (no), etc.\n\nBetween these, BROKE, CROME, DROME, PROBE are possible. PROBE is a valid word and tests P and B.\n\nLet me choose PROBE.\n\n<guess>PROBE</guess>After re-evaluating the feedback, the pattern is now clear: _ R O _ E.

From the five rounds we now have a fixed pattern and only one letter left to determine:

Pattern: C R O _ E  (positions 1-5)
Letters ruled out for position 4: A, S, U, T, G, V, P, B, N
Letters still allowed for position 4: D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit C R O _ E:
- C R O W E (W is allowed)
- C R O D E (D is allowed)
- C R O F E (F is allowed)
- C R O K E (K is allowed)
- C R O L E (L is allowed)
- C R O M E (M is allowed)

Among these, the only standard English word is CROWE (a surname/term), but CROWE isn’t in most dictionaries. The next most common is CRODE (anarchic term) and CROME (short for chromium, also uncommon). 

However, the most common and dictionary-valid word fitting C R O _ E is CROWE (though rare), and the next is CROME. Since we have only one guess left, we must pick the most plausible. 

Given the constraints, CROME is the only remaining plausible common word (short for chromium), so we'll test it.
