For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

Another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

3. Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   (plus any we haven’t tried yet).

4. The pattern so far: S _ O _ _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has O in the 3rd spot, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- SPOON – but P is untested, N is untested; however O repeats, which is fine.
- SMOKE – K is untested, E is already excluded.
- SLOSH – L, S, H are untested (S is already known).
- SUGAR – A is excluded.
- SUNNY – N, Y are untested.
- SWORE – W, R, E; R and E excluded.
- SHOWN – H, W, N are untested.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new consonants to narrow things down quickly.  
“SHOWN” gives us H, W, N—three fresh letters that are common.

Pattern check: S H O W N → S(✓) H ? O(✓) W ? N. All letters are allowed.

Therefore, guess SHOWN.

   Pattern: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   A, R, E, T, I, C, H, W

3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:

4. Remaining unused letters (that are allowed):
   B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   (plus N, which we now know must appear somewhere)

Since N is confirmed to be in the word and cannot be in position 5, it must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible patterns:
- S N O _ _
- S _ O N _

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns, using only allowed letters.

Looking at common words:
- SNOOK – uses K (allowed), but double O is not helpful.
- SNOOD – D is allowed, but ""SNOOD"" is uncommon.
- SPOON – P is allowed, but O repeats and we already know O is fixed in position 3.
- SLOOM – M is allowed, but ""SLOOM"" is rare.
- SPOON – already considered.
- SNOOK – considered.
- SUGAR – A excluded.
- SLOPE – P, E; E excluded.
- SLOSH – S, H, S; H excluded.
- SMOKE – K, E; E excluded.

Best candidates:
- SPOON: S P O O N → P and N are new, O repeats (but position 3 is fixed, so this is fine). However, N is in position 5 here, which we know is invalid (from SHOWN feedback). So discard.
- SNOOK: S N O O K → N in position 2 (valid), O in 3 (valid), K is new. This seems good.
- SLOOM: S L O O M → L and M are new, N is missing. We need N in the word, so discard.
- SUGAR: A excluded.
- SPOON: N in position 5 → invalid.
- SNOOK: N in position 2 → valid.

Another option:
- SPOON → N is in position 5 → invalid (from SHOWN feedback N(-)).
- SNOOK: N in position 2 → valid.

Thus, the best next guess is SNOOK, which places N in position 2 and introduces K as a new letter to test.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

Another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd spot and an S somewhere else, avoiding positions 1, 2, 4, 5 for S (since position 4 already gave ""-"" for S). Actually, the ""-"" only tells us S is in the word but not in position 4; it doesn't restrict other positions.

Good letters left to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and remaining vowels I, U.

Possible structure: _ _ O _ _ with an S in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let's think of words:
- SOUND: S O U N D - has O in 2nd, not 3rd. Doesn't fit.
- FOCUS: F O C U S - O is 2nd, not 3rd.
- MOTEL: M O T E L - E is excluded.

- SOLID: S O L I D - O is 2nd.
- STOIC: S T O I C - O is 3rd, S is 1st (allowed), I is 4th, C is 5th. No excluded letters. This seems valid.

STOIC fits:
- S in 1st position (not restricted)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

Another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd spot and an S somewhere else, avoiding positions 1, 2, 4, 5 for S (since position 4 already gave ""-"" for S). Actually, the ""-"" only tells us S is in the word but not in position 4; it doesn't restrict other positions.

Good letters left to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and remaining vowels I, U.

Possible structure: _ _ O _ _ with an S in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let's think of words:
- SOUND: S O U N D - has O in 2nd, not 3rd. Doesn't fit.
- FOCUS: F O C U S - O is 2nd, not 3rd.
- MOTEL: M O T E L - E is excluded.
- POSIT: P O S I T - O is 2nd.
- HOSTS: H O S T S - O is 2nd.
- CLOUD: C L O U D - O is 3rd, but no S.
- SOLID: S O L I D - O is 2nd.
- STOIC: S T O I C - O is 3rd, S is 1st (allowed), I is 4th, C is 5th. No excluded letters. This seems valid.

STOIC fits:
- S in 1st position (not restricted)
- O in 3rd (correct)
- T, I, C are new letters to test
- No A, R, E

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 1st letter: S (✓)
   - 3rd letter: O (✓)
   - 2nd, 4th, 5th letters: still unknown.

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   A, R, E, T, I, C

3. Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   (plus any we haven’t tried yet).

4. The pattern so far: S _ O _ _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has O in the 3rd spot, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- SPOON – but P is untested, N is untested; however O repeats, which is fine.
- SMOKE – K is untested, E is already excluded.
- SLOSH – L, S, H are untested (S is already known).
- SUGAR – A is excluded.
- SUNNY – N, Y are untested.
- SWORE – W, R, E; R and E excluded.
- SHOWN – H, W, N are untested.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new consonants to narrow things down quickly.  
“SHOWN” gives us H, W, N—three fresh letters that are common.

Pattern check: S H O W N → S(✓) H ? O(✓) W ? N. All letters are allowed.

Therefore, guess SHOWN.

From the three rounds we now have:

Known facts:
1. Fixed positions:
   - 1st letter: S
   - 3rd letter: O
   Pattern: S _ O _ _

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   A, R, E, T, I, C, H, W

3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - N (from SHOWN feedback: N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 5)

4. Remaining unused letters (that are allowed):
   B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   (plus N, which we now know must appear somewhere)

Since N is confirmed to be in the word and cannot be in position 5, it must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible patterns:
- S N O _ _
- S _ O N _

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns, using only allowed letters.

Looking at common words:
- SNOOK – uses K (allowed), but double O is not helpful.
- SNOOD – D is allowed, but ""SNOOD"" is uncommon.
- SPOON – P is allowed, but O repeats and we already know O is fixed in position 3.
- SLOOM – M is allowed, but ""SLOOM"" is rare.
- SPOON – already considered.
- SNOOK – considered.
- SUGAR – A excluded.
- SLOPE – P, E; E excluded.
- SLOSH – S, H, S; H excluded.
- SMOKE – K, E; E excluded.

Best candidates:
- SPOON: S P O O N → P and N are new, O repeats (but position 3 is fixed, so this is fine). However, N is in position 5 here, which we know is invalid (from SHOWN feedback). So discard.
- SNOOK: S N O O K → N in position 2 (valid), O in 3 (valid), K is new. This seems good.
- SLOOM: S L O O M → L and M are new, N is missing. We need N in the word, so discard.
- SUGAR: A excluded.
- SPOON: N in position 5 → invalid.
- SNOOK: N in position 2 → valid.

Another option:
- SPOON → N is in position 5 → invalid (from SHOWN feedback N(-)).
- SNOOK: N in position 2 → valid.

Thus, the best next guess is SNOOK, which places N in position 2 and introduces K as a new letter to test.

We now know the first three letters are S N O and the last letter cannot be P, K, A, R, E, T, I, C, H, W, O (because the fourth position cannot be O). The remaining allowed letters for the fifth position are: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S N O and ends with one of these letters. The only common English words that fit are:

- SNOUT (ends with U)
- SNOBS (ends with S, but S is already in position 1 and a word can't start and end with S unless it's ""SNOS_"" which isn't valid)
- SNOOD (ends with D, but ""SNOOD"" is uncommon)
- SNOOF (ends with F, but ""SNOOF"" is rare)
- SNOOM (ends with M, but ""SNOOM"" is not a standard word)

The most common and valid word left is SNOUT, which ends with U (a letter not yet ruled out).

Therefore, the next logical guess is SNOUT.
