For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 unique letters that are all very common, allowing us to quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains O and S, but:
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re in the word).
2. Moves O and S to new positions.
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (since A, R, E are out).

Letters not yet tested that are common: I, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W.

Let’s pick a word that includes O and S in different spots and adds a few of these new common letters. A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S moves from position 4 to position 1.
- O moves from position 3 to position 2.
- Adds I and C (both common and untested).
- T is also common and untested.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters and positions.

   – O is again in the word but not in position 2 or 3.  
   – T, I, C are not in the word.

So far we know:

- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C.
- Positions ruled out for O: 2, 3.  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, L, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W, U.

We want a new guess that:
- Uses O and S in positions not yet ruled out.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is “NOSYL” (though it’s not a common word). Instead, let’s use a more common word: “SONIC” was already ruled out (C is eliminated). Another option is “SPONG” (but G and P are okay, yet “SPONG” is obscure). A better common word is “SPOON” – but O is repeated, and we don’t know if O repeats. To avoid repeats and maximize new letters, let’s try “SOLAN” – but A is eliminated. Next, “SOLID” – I is eliminated. “SOUND” – U and D are okay. Let’s check:
- S in position 1 is ruled out (feedback said S not in position 1). So “SOUND” is invalid.

Next, “SNOUT” – T is eliminated. “SNUG” – G and U are okay, but “SNUG” is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. “SNOUT” is 5 letters but T is out. “SNUG” is invalid. “SNOWY” – W, Y are okay. Let’s check positions:
- S in position 1 is out. So “SNOWY” is invalid.

“SWORD” – D and W are okay. S in position 1 is out. Invalid.

“SWOMP” – P is okay, but “SWOMP” is obscure.

“SULFO” – F is okay, but U, L, F, O are used, yet S is in position 1 (out), and we don’t know about repeats of O.

“DONUS” – S is in position 5, which hasn’t been ruled out yet (S was ruled out in positions 1, 4). So position 5 is okay. Also introduces D, U, N. This seems valid.

Let’s pick “DONUS”:
- D, U, N are new common letters.

Next, “SNOUT” – T is eliminated. “SNUG” – G and U are okay, but “SNUG” is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. “SNOUT” is 5 letters but T is out. “SNUG” is invalid. “SNOWY” – W, Y are okay. Let’s check positions:
- S in position 1 is out. So “SNOWY” is invalid.

“SWORD” – D and W are okay. S in position 1 is out. Invalid.

“SWOMP” – P is okay, but “SWOMP” is obscure.

“SULFO” – F is okay, but U, L, F, O are used, yet S is in position 1 (out), and we don’t know about repeats of O.

“DONUS” – S is in position 5, which hasn’t been ruled out yet (S was ruled out in positions 1, 4). So position 5 is okay. Also introduces D, U, N. This seems valid.

Let’s pick “DONUS”:
- D, U, N are new common letters.
- O is in position 4 (not ruled out yet).
- S is in position 5 (not ruled out yet).
- No eliminated letters are used.

This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on “donus”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 unique letters that are all very common, allowing us to quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains O and S, but:
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re in the word).
2. Moves O and S to new positions.
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (since A, R, E are out).

Letters not yet tested that are common: I, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W.

Let’s pick a word that includes O and S in different spots and adds a few of these new common letters. A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S moves from position 4 to position 1.
- O moves from position 3 to position 2.
- Adds I and C (both common and untested).
- T is also common and untested.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters and positions.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – O and S are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

2. stoic → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)  
   – S is again in the word but not in position 1.  
   – O is again in the word but not in position 2 or 3.  
   – T, I, C are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O, S (and we still need to find the other three letters).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C.
- Positions ruled out for O: 2, 3.  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, L, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W, U.

We want a new guess that:
- Uses O and S in positions not yet ruled out.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is “NOSYL” (though it’s not a common word). Instead, let’s use a more common word: “SONIC” was already ruled out (C is eliminated). Another option is “SPONG” (but G and P are okay, yet “SPONG” is obscure). A better common word is “SPOON” – but O is repeated, and we don’t know if O repeats.

- S in position 1 is ruled out (feedback said S not in position 1). So “SOUND” is invalid.

Next, “SNOUT” – T is eliminated. “SNUG” – G and U are okay, but “SNUG” is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. “SNOUT” is 5 letters but T is out. “SNUG” is invalid. “SNOWY” – W, Y are okay. Let’s check positions:
- S in position 1 is out. So “SNOWY” is invalid.

“SWORD” – D and W are okay. S in position 1 is out. Invalid.

“SWOMP” – P is okay, but “SWOMP” is obscure.

“SULFO” – F is okay, but U, L, F, O are used, yet S is in position 1 (out), and we don’t know about repeats of O.

“DONUS” – S is in position 5, which hasn’t been ruled out yet (S was ruled out in positions 1, 4). So position 5 is okay. Also introduces D, U, N. This seems valid.

Let’s pick “DONUS”:
- D, U, N are new common letters.
- O is in position 4 (not ruled out yet).
- S is in position 5 (not ruled out yet).
- No eliminated letters are used.

This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on “honks”:
- H is NOT in the word (x).
- O, N, S are confirmed in their exact positions 2, 3, 5 (✓).
- K is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word is of the form:
_ O N _ S
and the fourth letter must be K (since K is in the word but not in position 4; the only remaining position for K is 1).

Therefore the word must be K O N _ S. The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is KONGS (though it's less common), or more likely KONIS (but I is eliminated), or KONOS (but O is already in position 2). Actually, the only valid word is KONGS, but that's obscure. 

Wait, let's re-examine: K must be in the word but not in position 4. The only positions left for K are 1 (since 2,3,5 are taken by O,N,S). So the word must be K O N _ S. The only common word fitting this is KONGS (a variant of kongs, but acceptable in Wordle lists). However, looking at standard word lists, ""KONOS"" isn't valid, ""KONGS"" is questionable. 

Another possibility: perhaps K is in position 1, making the word K O N _ S. The only valid word is KONGS, but if that's not accepted, we might have to consider KONIS (invalid, I is out), or KONOS (invalid, double O). 

Upon reflection, the most likely valid word is KONGS, but since this seems unlikely, let's check if we missed any letters. We have O(2), N(3), S(5) fixed, and K must be in 1 or 4. But 4 is not allowed for K (it was marked as -), so K must be in 1. Thus the word is K O N _ S. The only valid English word is KONGS (a plural form of kong, though rare), but in Wordle word lists, ""KONGS"" is acceptable.

Therefore, the correct guess is KONGS.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 unique letters that are all very common, allowing us to quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains O and S, but:
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re in the word).
2. Moves O and S to new positions.
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (since A, R, E are out).

Letters not yet tested that are common: I, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W.

Let’s pick a word that includes O and S in different spots and adds a few of these new common letters. A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S moves from position 4 to position 1.
- O moves from position 3 to position 2.
- Adds I and C (both common and untested).
- T is also common and untested.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters and positions.

Guess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – O and S are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

2. stoic → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)  
   – S is again in the word but not in position 1.  
   – O is again in the word but not in position 2 or 3.  
   – T, I, C are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O, S (and we still need to find the other three letters).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C.
- Positions ruled out for O: 2, 3.  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, L, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W, U.

We want a new guess that:
- Uses O and S in positions not yet ruled out.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is “NOSYL” (though it’s not a common word). Instead, let’s use a more common word: “SONIC” was already ruled out (C is eliminated). Another option is “SPONG” (but G and P are okay, yet “SPONG” is obscure). A better common word is “SPOON” – but O is repeated, and we don’t know if O repeats. To avoid repeats and maximize new letters, let’s try “SOLAN” – but A is eliminated. Next, “SOLID” – I is eliminated. “SOUND” – U and D are okay. Let’s check:
- S in position 1 is ruled out (feedback said S not in position 1). So “SOUND” is invalid.

Next, “SNOUT” – T is eliminated. “SNUG” – G and U are okay, but “SNUG” is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. “SNOUT” is 5 letters but T is out. “SNUG” is invalid. “SNOWY” – W, Y are okay. Let’s check positions:
- S in position 1 is out. So “SNOWY” is invalid.

“SWORD” – D and W are okay. S in position 1 is out. Invalid.

“SWOMP” – P is okay, but “SWOMP” is obscure.

“SULFO” – F is okay, but U, L, F, O are used, yet S is in position 1 (out), and we don’t know about repeats of O.

“DONUS” – S is in position 5, which hasn’t been ruled out yet (S was ruled out in positions 1, 4). So position 5 is okay. Also introduces D, U, N. This seems valid.

Let’s pick “DONUS”:
- D, U, N are new common letters.
- O is in position 4 (not ruled out yet).
- S is in position 5 (not ruled out yet).
- No eliminated letters are used.

This seems optimal.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C, D, U.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: L, P, M, G, H, B, F, Y, W, K.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining pool, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in “…ONS”.

Possible candidates:
- “HONKS” – K is okay, H is okay, but S is already fixed at 5, so “HONKS” would have S in position 5, which matches. Let’s check: H O N K S – valid word, all letters allowed.
- “BONKS” – B is okay, K is okay.
- “MONKS” – M is okay, K is okay.
- “GONKS” – G is okay, K is okay.
- “PONKS” – P is okay, K is okay.
- “FONKS” – F is okay, K is okay.
- “WONKS” – W is okay, K is okay.

Among these, “HONKS” is a common word and uses H, which hasn’t been tested yet.

Let’s go with “HONKS”.

The only valid English word is KONGS (a plural form of kong, though rare), but in Wordle word lists, ""KONGS"" is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the correct guess is KONGS.\n\n<guess>kongs</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)\nGuess 3: donus -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) U(x) S(✓)\nGuess 4: honks -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) K(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 5: kongs -> FEEDBACK: K(-) O(✓) N(✓) G(-) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the feedback on “kongs”:
- K is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- O, N, S are confirmed in positions 2, 3, 5 (✓).
- G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the pattern is still:
_ O N _ S

Letters we know:
- Must include: O, N, S (fixed at 2,3,5), K, G.
- K cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from previous feedback), and position 1 and 4 are the only open spots. But position 5 is already S, so positions 1 and 4 are the only ones left. However, K cannot be in 1 or 4 (from feedback), and G cannot be in 4. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- K was in position 1 in guess 5 and was marked (-), so K is NOT in position 1.
- G was in position 4 in guess 5 and was marked (-), so G is NOT in position 4.

But positions 1 and 4 are the only remaining positions to place K and G, yet:
- K cannot be in 1 (from above) and cannot be in 4 (from guess 4 feedback), so K has no valid position left. This implies our earlier assumption must be wrong.

Ah! The word must be exactly 5 letters with positions 1-5:
Current fixed letters: _ O N _ S (positions 2,3,5)
Letters known to be in the word: O, N, S, K, G
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C, D, U, H

So positions 1 and 4 must be filled with K and G in some order, but:
- K cannot be in position 1 (from guess 5 feedback)
- G cannot be in position 4 (from guess 5 feedback)

This creates a deadlock unless we consider that K and G must occupy positions 1 and 4, but neither can be in their previous positions. The only possible arrangement is:
- Position 1: G
- Position 4: K

Thus the word must be G O N K S.

Let's verify:
- G in position 1: not ruled out yet.
- K in position 4: not ruled out (only position 1 was ruled out for K).
- All letters are allowed and fit previous constraints.

This seems to be the only possible arrangement.
