For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth)
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters to keep: A, S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- We need new letters to test; good candidates are common consonants and vowels not yet tried, like T, N, L, C, D, I, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Use A and S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid R, O, E

Possible options: STAIN, SLANT, STAND, SAINT, etc.

I'll choose ""STAIN"" because:
- S moves to position 1 (allowed since S was only excluded from position 4)
- A moves to position 3 (allowed since A was excluded from position 1)

Constraints on positions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from AROSE and STAIN/SCALY)

The remaining common letters are: D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We want a word that:

- SHAKY (K is okay, but Y is excluded)  
- SPASM (P, M are okay)  

""SHAKY"" is invalid because Y is excluded.  
""SPASM"" uses S twice, which wastes a letter.  
""SWAMP"" uses S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), and introduces W, M, P. All letters are still allowed.

Therefore, ""SWAMP"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth)
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters to keep: A, S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- We need new letters to test; good candidates are common consonants and vowels not yet tried, like T, N, L, C, D, I, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Use A and S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid R, O, E

Possible options: STAIN, SLANT, STAND, SAINT, etc.

I'll choose ""STAIN"" because:
- S moves to position 1 (allowed since S was only excluded from position 4)
- A moves to position 3 (allowed since A was excluded from position 1)
- Introduces T, I, N which are common and untested
- Avoids R, O, E

What we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, S  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from AROSE and STAIN)  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STAIN)

So the remaining positions for A and S are:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5  
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5  

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The unused common letters include: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y.

A good next word should:
1. Place A and S in new positions  
2. Introduce as many of the still-possible common letters as possible  
3. Avoid any of the excluded letters (R, O, E, T, I, N)

Candidate words:

From all four guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L, Y, W, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word:  
A and S (positions still unknown)

Position restrictions so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4  

Therefore:
- A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5  
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5  

We have not yet tested the letters:  
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, B, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S  
2. Places A and S only in their allowed positions  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out  
4. Introduces as many new common letters as possible

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- GASPY (but Y is out)  
- BASIN (but I, N are out)  
- DASH (too short)  
- HAKAS (but K is okay)  
- GASPS (but P is out)  
- GASSY (Y is out)  
- HASSA (but S in position 4 is out)  

The only remaining common letters we can use are D, G, H, K, U, V.  
A valid word using these: ""GASPU"" (but not a real word).  
Another: ""HAKAS"" (valid word, uses H, K, A, S).  

Let’s check:
- H: not yet tested  
- K: not yet tested  
- A: position 3 (allowed)  
- S: position 4 (but S cannot be in position 4, from AROSE feedback)  

Oops, S in position 4 is invalid.  
Next: ""VASUK"" (but not a real word).  
Next: ""DASHU"" (but S in position 3 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed).  
""DASHU"" is a valid word (meaning a dagger in some contexts).

Letters: D, A, S, H, U – all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- A in 2 (allowed)  
- S in 3 (allowed)  

So ""DASHU"" is valid.  
However, ""DASH"" is 4 letters; we need 5.  
Another word: ""HADSU"" (invalid).  
Another: ""KASUD"" (invalid).  
Another: ""GASUK"" (invalid).  

Actually, ""HAKAS"" was invalid because S in 4 is out.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words with A and S only in allowed positions:

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5  
Possible positions for S: 2,3,5  

We need to place A and S without overlap and fill the rest with allowed letters.

Try A in 2, S in 3: _ A S _ _  
Allowed letters left: D, G, H, K, U, V  
Need two more letters.  
Possible word: ""DASGU"" (invalid).  
""GASDU"" (invalid).  
""VASDK"" (invalid).  

Try A in 4, S in 2: _ S _ A _  
Possible word: ""DSKAV"" (invalid).  
""GSVAK"" (invalid).  

Try A in 5, S in 2: _ S _ _ A  
Possible word: ""DSKUA"" (invalid).  
""GSKUA"" (invalid).  

Try A in 2, S in 5: _ A _ _ S  
Possible word: ""DAHUS"" (invalid).  
""GAHUS"" (invalid).  

Try A in 4, S in 5: _ _ _ A S  
Possible word: ""DHAKS"" (invalid).  
""DGKAS"" (invalid).  

Try A in 2, S in 3: _ A S _ _  
Real word: ""BASIS"" (B is okay, I is out)  
""BASIN"" (I, N out)  
""VASAL"" (L out)  

Actually, ""HAKAS"" was invalid because S in 4 is out.  
But ""HAKAS"" has S in 3 (allowed) and A in 2 (allowed).  
""HAKAS"" is a valid word meaning a type of dance.  

Let’s check letters: H, A, K, A, S  
- H: not yet tested  
- K: not yet tested  
- A: position 2 (allowed)  
- S: position 3 (allowed)  

So ""HAKAS"" is valid and uses new letters H and K.  

Therefore, ""HAKAS"" is the best next guess.

- A cannot be in positions 1, 3  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4  

Therefore:
- A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5  
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5  

We have not yet tested the letters:  
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, B, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S  
2. Places A and S only in their allowed positions  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out  
4. Introduces as many new common letters as possible

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- GASPY (but Y is out)  
- BASIN (but I, N are out)  
- DASH (too short)  
- HAKAS (but K is okay)  
- GASPS (but P is out)  
- GASSY (Y is out)  
- HASSA (but S in position 4 is out)  

The only remaining common letters we can use are D, G, H, K, U, V.  
A valid word using these: ""GASPU"" (but not a real word).  
Another: ""HAKAS"" (valid word, uses H, K, A, S).  

Let’s check:
- H: not yet tested  
- K: not yet tested  
- A: position 3 (allowed)  
- S: position 4 (but S cannot be in position 4, from AROSE feedback)  

Oops, S in position 4 is invalid.  
Next: ""VASUK"" (but not a real word).  
Next: ""DASHU"" (but S in position 3 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed).  
""DASHU"" is a valid word (meaning a dagger in some contexts).

Letters: D, A, S, H, U – all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- A in 2 (allowed)  
- S in 3 (allowed)  

So ""DASHU"" is valid.  
However, ""DASH"" is 4 letters; we need 5.  
Another word: ""HADSU"" (invalid).  
Another: ""KASUD"" (invalid).  
Another: ""GASUK"" (invalid).  

Actually, ""HAKAS"" was invalid because S in 4 is out.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words with A and S only in allowed positions:

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5  
Possible positions for S: 2,3,5  

We need to place A and S without overlap and fill the rest with allowed letters.

Try A in 2, S in 3: _ A S _ _  
Allowed letters left: D, G, H, K, U, V  
Need two more letters.  
Possible word: ""DASGU"" (invalid).  
""GASDU"" (invalid).  
""VASDK"" (invalid).  

Try A in 4, S in 2: _ S _ A _  
Possible word: ""DSKAV"" (invalid).  
""GSVAK"" (invalid).  

Try A in 5, S in 2: _ S _ _ A  
Possible word: ""DSKUA"" (invalid).  
""GSKUA"" (invalid).  

Try A in 2, S in 5: _ A _ _ S  
Possible word: ""DAHUS"" (invalid).  
""GAHUS"" (invalid).  

Try A in 4, S in 5: _ _ _ A S  
Possible word: ""DHAKS"" (invalid).  
""DGKAS"" (invalid).  

Try A in 2, S in 3: _ A S _ _  
Real word: ""BASIS"" (B is okay, I is out)  
""BASIN"" (I, N out)  
""VASAL"" (L out)  

Actually, ""HAKAS"" was invalid because S in 4 is out.  
But ""HAKAS"" has S in 3 (allowed) and A in 2 (allowed).  
""HAKAS"" is a valid word meaning a type of dance.  

Let’s check letters: H, A, K, A, S  
- H: not yet tested  
- K: not yet tested  
- A: position 2 (allowed)  
- S: position 3 (allowed)  

So ""HAKAS"" is valid and uses new letters H and K.  

Therefore, ""HAKAS"" is the best next guess.",Guess 5: HAKAS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) K(x) A(✓) S(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth)
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters to keep: A, S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- We need new letters to test; good candidates are common consonants and vowels not yet tried, like T, N, L, C, D, I, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Use A and S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid R, O, E

Possible options: STAIN, SLANT, STAND, SAINT, etc.

I'll choose ""STAIN"" because:
- S moves to position 1 (allowed since S was only excluded from position 4)
- A moves to position 3 (allowed since A was excluded from position 1)
- Introduces T, I, N which are common and untested
- Avoids R, O, E

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: S T A I N  
Feedback: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)

What we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, S  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from AROSE and STAIN)  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STAIN)

So the remaining positions for A and S are:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5  
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5  

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The unused common letters include: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y.

A good next word should:
1. Place A and S in new positions  
2. Introduce as many of the still-possible common letters as possible  
3. Avoid any of the excluded letters (R, O, E, T, I, N)

Candidate words:
- SCUPA (but P is less common)  
- CLAPS (but L is fine, P is less common)  
- SCALY (Y is acceptable, but L is already okay)  
- PLASM (but M is okay)  
- SCAMP (C, M, P are okay)

""SCALY"" looks good because:
- Uses S in position 1 (allowed)  
- Uses A in position 3 (allowed)  
- Introduces C, L, Y which are all still possible  
- Avoids every excluded letter

Guess 3: S C A L Y  
Feedback: S(-) C(x) A(-) L(x) Y(x)

Summary of what we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L, Y

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
A, S

Constraints on positions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from AROSE and STAIN/SCALY)  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from AROSE and SCALY)

So possible positions:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5  
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5  

We still need to test other common letters that haven’t been used yet.  
The remaining common letters are: D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We want a word that:
1. Uses A and S in new allowed positions  
2. Introduces as many new common letters as possible  
3. Avoids every excluded letter

Candidate words:
- SPAMD (uses P, M, D but M and D are okay)  
- SAMUD (U is okay)  
- SWAMP (W, M, P are okay)  
- SHAKY (K is okay, but Y is excluded)  
- SPASM (P, M are okay)  

""SHAKY"" is invalid because Y is excluded.  
""SPASM"" uses S twice, which wastes a letter.  
""SWAMP"" uses S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), and introduces W, M, P. All letters are still allowed.

Therefore, ""SWAMP"" is a good next guess.

From all four guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L, Y, W, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word:  
A and S (positions still unknown)

Position restrictions so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4  

Therefore:
- A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5  
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5  

We have not yet tested the letters:  
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, B, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S  
2. Places A and S only in their allowed positions  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out  
4. Introduces as many new common letters as possible

The only remaining common letters we can use are D, G, H, K, U, V.  
A valid word using these: ""GASPU"" (but not a real word).  
Another: ""HAKAS"" (valid word, uses H, K, A, S).  

Let’s check:
- H: not yet tested  
- K: not yet tested  
- A: position 3 (allowed)  
- S: position 4 (but S cannot be in position 4, from AROSE feedback)  

Oops, S in position 4 is invalid.  
Next: ""VASUK"" (but not a real word).  
Next: ""DASHU"" (but S in position 3 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed).  
""DASHU"" is a valid word (meaning a dagger in some contexts).

Letters: D, A, S, H, U – all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- A in 2 (allowed)

""VASAL"" (L out)  

Actually, ""HAKAS"" was invalid because S in 4 is out.  
But ""HAKAS"" has S in 3 (allowed) and A in 2 (allowed).  
""HAKAS"" is a valid word meaning a type of dance.  

Let’s check letters: H, A, K, A, S  
- H: not yet tested  
- K: not yet tested  
- A: position 2 (allowed)  
- S: position 3 (allowed)  

So ""HAKAS"" is valid and uses new letters H and K.  

Therefore, ""HAKAS"" is the best next guess.

From Guess 5 (HAKAS) we received:

H(x)  A(✓)  K(x)  A(✓)  S(✓)

This tells us:

- A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).
- H and K are NOT in the word.
- The fourth letter is A (position 4 is ✓).

So the word has the pattern:

_  A  _  A  S

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, L, Y, W, M, P, H, K.

Remaining common letters we can use: D, G, F, J, Q, U, V, B, X, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A _ A S and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- D A V A S (but ""DAVAS"" is not a valid English word)
- G A V A S (not valid)
- B A V A S (not valid)
- F A V A S (not valid)
- V A D A S (not valid)
- V A G A S (not valid)
- G A D A S (not valid)

Looking at valid English words that fit the pattern _A_A_S:

- BAGAS (not valid)
- DAGAS (not valid)
- FAVAS (valid, meaning small beans)
- JAGAS (not valid)
- VADAS (not valid)
- VAGAS (valid, plural of ""vaga"")

Between ""FAVAS"" and ""VAGAS"", both are valid. ""FAVAS"" uses F and V (both allowed), while ""VAGAS"" uses V and G (both allowed). Either could work, but ""FAVAS"" is more common.

However, let's check if F is allowed - it hasn't been tested yet and isn't in the excluded list.

Thus, ""FAVAS"" is a valid guess.

But wait, let's verify:
- F: not yet tested, allowed
- A: position 2 ✓
- V: not yet tested, allowed
- A: position 4 ✓
- S: position 5 ✓

This fits perfectly.
