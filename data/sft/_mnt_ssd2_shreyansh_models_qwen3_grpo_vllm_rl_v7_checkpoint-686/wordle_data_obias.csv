2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help eliminate possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common consonants and vowels. It's a balanced choice that should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(x): T is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains S and A, but neither is in its current spot.
2. The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.
3. Positions 1, 3, 5 are still unknown but must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
4. The remaining letters must come from the unused pool (excluding L, T, E).

Next, I want to test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Good candidates to test next are R, O, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc. Since S and A must appear somewhere, I should place them in new positions.

Possible placements:
- S cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 3.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 or 3 or 4, and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that uses new common letters and respects these constraints is “ROANS”:
- R: new letter.
- O: new letter.
- A: in position 3 (but original feedback said A is not in position 3, so this would be invalid).

Oops, A cannot be in position 3. Let me try “CRANE”:
- C: new letter.
- R: new letter.
- A: position 3 (invalid, same issue).

Let me try “SONAR”:
- S: position 1 (invalid, S cannot be here).

Let me try “RANCH”:
- R: new.
- A: position 2 (valid).
- N: new.
- C: new.
- H: new.

This seems valid. It places A in position 2, S is still unplaced but will be tested in a future guess if needed. However, I want to ensure S is included in this guess since we know it’s in the word.

Let me try “RASPY”:
- R: new.
- A: position 2 (valid).
- S: position 3 (valid, since S can be here).
- P: new.
- Y: new.

This includes S in position 3, A in position 2, and introduces new common letters R, P, Y.

But Y is less common. Let me try “RASPY” anyway as it’s a valid word and tests new letters.

Alternatively, “SARAN”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

“ARSON”:
- A: position 1 (valid).
- R: new.
- S: position 3 (valid).
- O: new.

From the two guesses so far we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. ARSON → A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, O
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 4.

We still need to test other common letters (D, I, C, U, M, P, etc.) while placing A, S, O in allowed spots.

A good next word would:
- Include A, S, O in still-allowed positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

Let’s try “ADIOS”:
- A in position 1 (but we know A cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Try “COAST”:
- C: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- A: position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “POSIT”:
- P: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- S: position 3 (but S cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “COBAS”:
- C: new.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- B: new.
- A: position 4 (allowed).
- S: position 5 (allowed).

This places:
- A in 4 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- Introduces C and B.

“COBAS” is a valid 5-letter word (though less common; alternatives might be better).

A more common word that fits: “COAST” was invalid because A can’t be in 3. Next option: “COBAS” seems closest, but let’s look for something more common.

Try “SOAPY”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “SOUND”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “CLOUD”:
- L is excluded.

Try “DOING”:
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- I: new.
- N: excluded.

Try “COPAS”:
- C: new.
- O: 2 (allowed).
- P: new.
- A: 4 (allowed).

“COPAS” is valid and fits all constraints.

  – S cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 4.

We still need to test other common letters (D, I, C, U, M, P, etc.) while placing A, S, O in allowed spots.

A good next word would:
- Include A, S, O in still-allowed positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

Let’s try “ADIOS”:
- A in position 1 (but we know A cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Try “COAST”:
- C: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- A: position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “POSIT”:
- P: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- S: position 3 (but S cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “COBAS”:
- C: new.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- B: new.
- A: position 4 (allowed).
- S: position 5 (allowed).

This places:
- A in 4 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- Introduces C and B.

“COBAS” is a valid 5-letter word (though less common; alternatives might be better).

A more common word that fits: “COAST” was invalid because A can’t be in 3. Next option: “COBAS” seems closest, but let’s look for something more common.

Try “SOAPY”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “SOUND”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “CLOUD”:
- L is excluded.

Try “DOING”:
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- I: new.
- N: excluded.

Try “COPAS”:
- C: new.
- O: 2 (allowed).
- P: new.
- A: 4 (allowed).
- S: 5 (allowed).

“COPAS” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “COPAS”.",Guess 3: COPAS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) P(x) A(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help eliminate possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common consonants and vowels. It's a balanced choice that should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(x): T is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains S and A, but neither is in its current spot.
2. The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.
3. Positions 1, 3, 5 are still unknown but must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
4. The remaining letters must come from the unused pool (excluding L, T, E).

Next, I want to test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Good candidates to test next are R, O, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc. Since S and A must appear somewhere, I should place them in new positions.

Possible placements:
- S cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 3.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 or 3 or 4, and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that uses new common letters and respects these constraints is “ROANS”:
- R: new letter.
- O: new letter.
- A: in position 3 (but original feedback said A is not in position 3, so this would be invalid).

Oops, A cannot be in position 3. Let me try “CRANE”:
- C: new letter.
- R: new letter.
- A: position 3 (invalid, same issue).

Let me try “SONAR”:
- S: position 1 (invalid, S cannot be here).

Let me try “RANCH”:
- R: new.
- A: position 2 (valid).
- N: new.
- C: new.
- H: new.

This seems valid. It places A in position 2, S is still unplaced but will be tested in a future guess if needed. However, I want to ensure S is included in this guess since we know it’s in the word.

Let me try “RASPY”:
- R: new.
- A: position 2 (valid).
- S: position 3 (valid, since S can be here).
- P: new.
- Y: new.

This includes S in position 3, A in position 2, and introduces new common letters R, P, Y.

But Y is less common. Let me try “RASPY” anyway as it’s a valid word and tests new letters.

Alternatively, “SARAN”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

“ARSON”:
- A: position 1 (valid).
- R: new.
- S: position 3 (valid).
- O: new.
- N: new.

This looks good. It places A in position 1, S in position 3, and introduces R, O, N.

Let me go with “ARSON”.

Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. ARSON → A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, O
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 4.

We still need to test other common letters (D, I, C, U, M, P, etc.) while placing A, S, O in allowed spots.

A good next word would:
- Include A, S, O in still-allowed positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

Let’s try “ADIOS”:
- A in position 1 (but we know A cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Try “COAST”:
- C: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- A: position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “POSIT”:
- P: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- S: position 3 (but S cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “COBAS”:
- C: new.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- B: new.
- A: position 4 (allowed).
- S: position 5 (allowed).

This places:
- A in 4 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- Introduces C and B.

“COBAS” is a valid 5-letter word (though less common; alternatives might be better).

A more common word that fits: “COAST” was invalid because A can’t be in 3. Next option: “COBAS” seems closest, but let’s look for something more common.

Try “SOAPY”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “SOUND”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “CLOUD”:
- L is excluded.

Try “DOING”:
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- I: new.
- N: excluded.

Try “COPAS”:
- C: new.
- O: 2 (allowed).
- P: new.
- A: 4 (allowed).
- S: 5 (allowed).

“COPAS” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “COPAS”.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are out.

2. ARSON → A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   - A is not in position 1.
   - S is not in position 3.
   - O is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, N are out.

3. COPAS → C(x) O(-) P(x) A(✓) S(✓)
   - A is correctly placed in position 4.
   - S is correctly placed in position 5.
   - C, P are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- Word ends with “…AS” (positions 4-5 fixed).
- O is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N, C, P.
- Positions 1-3 must be filled with remaining letters: A, O, S are already confirmed, but A and S are already fixed in 4-5, so O must be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 2 (from COPAS) or 4 (from ARSON), and 4-5 are fixed, so O must be in position 1 or 3.
- But A is not in position 3 (from SLATE), and S is not in position 3 (from ARSON), so position 3 must be O.

Thus the word structure is: _ O _ A S.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining unused pool: common letters not yet excluded include D, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a common pair: D and I form “DOIAS” (invalid), or “DO” + “IAS”… Actually, we need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ A S.

Possible candidates:
- DOGAS (invalid)
- BOGAS (invalid)
- HOAGS (invalid)
- MOAS (needs 5 letters)

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid words fitting this:
- DOGAS – invalid
- BOGAS – invalid
- HOAGS – invalid
- MOGAS – invalid
- DODAS – invalid
- BODAS – valid (BODAS is a word, plural of boda)

But let’s find a more common word: “BOGAS” is not standard.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid English words:
- DOGAS – no
- HOAGS – no
- MOGAS – no
- BODAS – yes (BODAS is valid, plural of boda)

But let’s try “DOING” – no, N is excluded.

Wait, let me list possible letters for positions 1 and 2: from remaining letters (excluding L,T,E,R,N,C,P,A,S,O). The remaining common letters are D, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try “DO” + “M” + “AS” → “DOMAS” – invalid.

“BO” + “D” + “AS” → “BODAS” – valid.

“HO” + “D” + “AS” → “HODAS” – invalid.

“GO” + “D” + “AS” → “GODAS” – invalid.

“MO” + D + AS → “MODAS” – invalid.

“B” + “O” + “D” + “A” + “S” → “BODAS”.

Another option: “DO” + “G” + “AS” → “DOGAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “I” + “G” + “AS” → “DOIGAS” – too long.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid 5-letter words:
- BODAS
- CODAS – but C is excluded.
- DOMAS – invalid
- DOGAS – invalid
- HODAS – invalid
- MODAS – invalid
- GODAS – invalid
- JODAS – invalid
- KODAS – invalid
- LODAS – L excluded
- MODOAS – too long
- NODAS – N excluded
- PODAS – P excluded
- SODAS – S is already in 5, but S is allowed in 1? Actually S is allowed in 1 (only restricted in 1 and 3). But S is already in 5.

Wait, S is already in 5, so S cannot be in 1 (from SLATE feedback: S is in word but not in position 1).

Thus position 1 cannot be S.

So the only valid word seems to be “BODAS”.

But let me double-check: is there another word?

“DO” + “M” + “AS” → “DOMAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “B” + “AS” → “DOBAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “G” + “AS” → “DOGAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “U” + “G” + “AS” → “DOUGAS” – too long.

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ O _ A S with constraints seems to be “BODAS”.

But let me confirm: is “BODAS” a valid English word? Yes, it is the plural of “boda” (a type of dance in some cultures).

Thus, the next guess is “BODAS”.

</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- Positions 4-5 are A S.
- O must be in position 1 or 3.
- Position 3 cannot be A (already in 4) or S (already in 5), so O must be in position 1.
- Therefore the word is _ O _ A S.
- Valid English word fitting this: BODAS.

<guess>BODAS</guess>",BODAS,"From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.

   - A is correctly placed in position 4.
   - S is correctly placed in position 5.
   - C, P are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- Word ends with “…AS” (positions 4-5 fixed).
- O is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N, C, P.
- Positions 1-3 must be filled with remaining letters: A, O, S are already confirmed, but A and S are already fixed in 4-5, so O must be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 2 (from COPAS) or 4 (from ARSON), and 4-5 are fixed, so O must be in position 1 or 3.
- But A is not in position 3 (from SLATE), and S is not in position 3 (from ARSON), so position 3 must be O.

Thus the word structure is: _ O _ A S.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining unused pool: common letters not yet excluded include D, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a common pair: D and I form “DOIAS” (invalid), or “DO” + “IAS”… Actually, we need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ A S.

Possible candidates:
- DOGAS (invalid)
- BOGAS (invalid)
- HOAGS (invalid)
- MOAS (needs 5 letters)

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid words fitting this:
- DOGAS – invalid
- BOGAS – invalid
- HOAGS – invalid
- MOGAS – invalid
- DODAS – invalid
- BODAS – valid (BODAS is a word, plural of boda)

But let’s find a more common word: “BOGAS” is not standard.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid English words:
- DOGAS – no
- HOAGS – no
- MOGAS – no
- BODAS – yes (BODAS is valid, plural of boda)

But let’s try “DOING” – no, N is excluded.

Wait, let me list possible letters for positions 1 and 2: from remaining letters (excluding L,T,E,R,N,C,P,A,S,O). The remaining common letters are D, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try “DO” + “M” + “AS” → “DOMAS” – invalid.

“BO” + “D” + “AS” → “BODAS” – valid.

“HO” + “D” + “AS” → “HODAS” – invalid.

“GO” + “D” + “AS” → “GODAS” – invalid.

“MO” + D + AS → “MODAS” – invalid.

“B” + “O” + “D” + “A” + “S” → “BODAS”.

Another option: “DO” + “G” + “AS” → “DOGAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “I” + “G” + “AS” → “DOIGAS” – too long.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid 5-letter words:
- BODAS
- CODAS – but C is excluded.
- DOMAS – invalid
- DOGAS – invalid
- HODAS – invalid
- MODAS – invalid
- GODAS – invalid
- JODAS – invalid
- KODAS – invalid
- LODAS – L excluded
- MODOAS – too long
- NODAS – N excluded
- PODAS – P excluded
- SODAS – S is already in 5, but S is allowed in 1? Actually S is allowed in 1 (only restricted in 1 and 3). But S is already in 5.

Wait, S is already in 5, so S cannot be in 1 (from SLATE feedback: S is in word but not in position 1).

Thus position 1 cannot be S.

So the only valid word seems to be “BODAS”.

But let me double-check: is there another word?

“DO” + “M” + “AS” → “DOMAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “B” + “AS” → “DOBAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “G” + “AS” → “DOGAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “U” + “G” + “AS” → “DOUGAS” – too long.

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ O _ A S with constraints seems to be “BODAS”.

But let me confirm: is “BODAS” a valid English word? Yes, it is the plural of “boda” (a type of dance in some cultures).

Thus, the next guess is “BODAS”.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- Positions 4-5 are A S.
- O must be in position 1 or 3.
- Position 3 cannot be A (already in 4) or S (already in 5), so O must be in position 1.
- Therefore the word is _ O _ A S.
- Valid English word fitting this: BODAS.",Guess 4: BODAS -> FEEDBACK: B(-) O(-) D(x) A(✓) S(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help eliminate possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common consonants and vowels. It's a balanced choice that should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(x): T is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains S and A, but neither is in its current spot.
2. The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.
3. Positions 1, 3, 5 are still unknown but must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
4. The remaining letters must come from the unused pool (excluding L, T, E).

Next, I want to test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Good candidates to test next are R, O, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc. Since S and A must appear somewhere, I should place them in new positions.

Possible placements:
- S cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 3.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 or 3 or 4, and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that uses new common letters and respects these constraints is “ROANS”:
- R: new letter.
- O: new letter.
- A: in position 3 (but original feedback said A is not in position 3, so this would be invalid).

Oops, A cannot be in position 3. Let me try “CRANE”:
- C: new letter.
- R: new letter.
- A: position 3 (invalid, same issue).

Let me try “SONAR”:
- S: position 1 (invalid, S cannot be here).

Let me try “RANCH”:
- R: new.
- A: position 2 (valid).
- N: new.
- C: new.
- H: new.

This seems valid. It places A in position 2, S is still unplaced but will be tested in a future guess if needed. However, I want to ensure S is included in this guess since we know it’s in the word.

Let me try “RASPY”:
- R: new.
- A: position 2 (valid).
- S: position 3 (valid, since S can be here).
- P: new.
- Y: new.

This includes S in position 3, A in position 2, and introduces new common letters R, P, Y.

But Y is less common. Let me try “RASPY” anyway as it’s a valid word and tests new letters.

Alternatively, “SARAN”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

“ARSON”:
- A: position 1 (valid).
- R: new.
- S: position 3 (valid).
- O: new.
- N: new.

This looks good. It places A in position 1, S in position 3, and introduces R, O, N.

Let me go with “ARSON”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. ARSON → A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, O
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 4.

We still need to test other common letters (D, I, C, U, M, P, etc.) while placing A, S, O in allowed spots.

A good next word would:
- Include A, S, O in still-allowed positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

Let’s try “ADIOS”:
- A in position 1 (but we know A cannot be in position 1) – invalid.

Try “COAST”:
- C: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- A: position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “POSIT”:
- P: new letter.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- S: position 3 (but S cannot be in position 3) – invalid.

Try “COBAS”:
- C: new.
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- B: new.
- A: position 4 (allowed).
- S: position 5 (allowed).

This places:
- A in 4 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- Introduces C and B.

“COBAS” is a valid 5-letter word (though less common; alternatives might be better).

A more common word that fits: “COAST” was invalid because A can’t be in 3. Next option: “COBAS” seems closest, but let’s look for something more common.

Try “SOAPY”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “SOUND”:
- S: position 1 (invalid).

Try “CLOUD”:
- L is excluded.

Try “DOING”:
- O: position 2 (allowed).
- I: new.
- N: excluded.

Try “COPAS”:
- C: new.
- O: 2 (allowed).
- P: new.
- A: 4 (allowed).
- S: 5 (allowed).

“COPAS” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “COPAS”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
Guess 3: COPAS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) P(x) A(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are out.

2. ARSON → A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   - A is not in position 1.
   - S is not in position 3.
   - O is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, N are out.

3. COPAS → C(x) O(-) P(x) A(✓) S(✓)
   - A is correctly placed in position 4.
   - S is correctly placed in position 5.
   - C, P are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- Word ends with “…AS” (positions 4-5 fixed).
- O is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4.
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N, C, P.
- Positions 1-3 must be filled with remaining letters: A, O, S are already confirmed, but A and S are already fixed in 4-5, so O must be in 1 or 3.
  – O cannot be in 2 (from COPAS) or 4 (from ARSON), and 4-5 are fixed, so O must be in position 1 or 3.
- But A is not in position 3 (from SLATE), and S is not in position 3 (from ARSON), so position 3 must be O.

Thus the word structure is: _ O _ A S.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining unused pool: common letters not yet excluded include D, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a common pair: D and I form “DOIAS” (invalid), or “DO” + “IAS”… Actually, we need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ A S.

Possible candidates:
- DOGAS (invalid)
- BOGAS (invalid)
- HOAGS (invalid)
- MOAS (needs 5 letters)

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid words fitting this:
- DOGAS – invalid
- BOGAS – invalid
- HOAGS – invalid
- MOGAS – invalid
- DODAS – invalid
- BODAS – valid (BODAS is a word, plural of boda)

But let’s find a more common word: “BOGAS” is not standard.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid English words:
- DOGAS – no
- HOAGS – no
- MOGAS – no
- BODAS – yes (BODAS is valid, plural of boda)

But let’s try “DOING” – no, N is excluded.

Wait, let me list possible letters for positions 1 and 2: from remaining letters (excluding L,T,E,R,N,C,P,A,S,O). The remaining common letters are D, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try “DO” + “M” + “AS” → “DOMAS” – invalid.

“BO” + “D” + “AS” → “BODAS” – valid.

“HO” + “D” + “AS” → “HODAS” – invalid.

“GO” + “D” + “AS” → “GODAS” – invalid.

“MO” + D + AS → “MODAS” – invalid.

“B” + “O” + “D” + “A” + “S” → “BODAS”.

Another option: “DO” + “G” + “AS” → “DOGAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “I” + “G” + “AS” → “DOIGAS” – too long.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ A S.

Valid 5-letter words:
- BODAS
- CODAS – but C is excluded.
- DOMAS – invalid
- DOGAS – invalid
- HODAS – invalid
- MODAS – invalid
- GODAS – invalid
- JODAS – invalid
- KODAS – invalid
- LODAS – L excluded
- MODOAS – too long
- NODAS – N excluded
- PODAS – P excluded
- SODAS – S is already in 5, but S is allowed in 1? Actually S is allowed in 1 (only restricted in 1 and 3). But S is already in 5.

Wait, S is already in 5, so S cannot be in 1 (from SLATE feedback: S is in word but not in position 1).

Thus position 1 cannot be S.

So the only valid word seems to be “BODAS”.

But let me double-check: is there another word?

“DO” + “M” + “AS” → “DOMAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “B” + “AS” → “DOBAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “G” + “AS” → “DOGAS” – invalid.

“DO” + “U” + “G” + “AS” → “DOUGAS” – too long.

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ O _ A S with constraints seems to be “BODAS”.

But let me confirm: is “BODAS” a valid English word? Yes, it is the plural of “boda” (a type of dance in some cultures).

Thus, the next guess is “BODAS”.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- Positions 4-5 are A S.
- O must be in position 1 or 3.
- Position 3 cannot be A (already in 4) or S (already in 5), so O must be in position 1.
- Therefore the word is _ O _ A S.
- Valid English word fitting this: BODAS.

From the four guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are out.

2. ARSON → A(-) R(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   - A is not in position 1.
   - S is not in position 3.
   - O is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, N are out.

3. COPAS → C(x) O(-) P(x) A(✓) S(✓)
   - A is correctly placed in position 4.
   - S is correctly placed in position 5.
   - C, P are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.

4. BODAS → B(-) O(-) D(x) A(✓) S(✓)
   - A and S are confirmed in positions 4-5.
   - B is in the word but not in position 1.
   - D is out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (already known) and now also not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word ends with “…AS” (positions 4-5 fixed).
- O is in the word, must be in position 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 2,4,5).
- B is in the word, must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be 1).
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, R, N, C, P, D.
- Remaining letters to use: A, O, S are already placed; B must be used; we need one more letter from the remaining pool (e.g., F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y).

But we only have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, with constraints:
- Position 1: must be O or B (but B cannot be in position 1 from BODAS feedback), so position 1 must be O.
- Position 2: must be B (since B must be in 2 or 3, and position 3 could also be B but we’ll see).
- Position 3: must be a new letter, but we have very few choices left.

Wait, let’s reconstruct:
- Position 1: O (since it must be 1 or 3, and can’t be 2,4,5; and B can’t be 1).
- Position 2: must be B (since B must be in 2 or 3).
- Position 3: must be a new letter, but we have limited options.

So the word structure is: O B _ A S.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with OB and ending with AS.

Possible candidates:
- OBELAS – invalid
- OBIAS – invalid
- OBGAMS – too long
- OBOAS – invalid
- OBNAS – invalid
- OBMAS – invalid
- OBUGS – ends with GS, not AS.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting O B _ A S is “OBELAS” which is not recognized. This suggests our assumption might be off.

Let me re-examine:
- Position 1: must be O (only remaining spot for O).
- Position 2: must be B (since B must be in 2 or 3).
- Position 3: must be a new letter, but we have very few choices left (e.g., F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y).

Looking for a valid word: O B _ A S.

The only valid word seems to be “OBIAS” (though it’s rare) or “OBELAS” (invalid). 

However, let me check if there are other possibilities:
- O B I A S → “OBIAS” – valid (though uncommon, it’s a word).
- O B U A S – invalid.
- O B G A S – invalid.

Thus, the most plausible next guess is “OBIAS”.

But let me verify: is “OBIAS” a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, it is (short for “obedientia” or a variant spelling).

Therefore, the next guess is “OBIAS”.

Based on the feedback, the word must end with “…AS” and contain O and B in the remaining positions. The only valid word fitting these constraints is “OBIAS”.
