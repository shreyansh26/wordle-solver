For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

The clearest valid word fitting R A _ _ O with new letters is RALTO or RACON, but RALTO is more likely a recognized word. However, RALTO is listed in dictionaries as a variant spelling of “ralt” (a dialectal term), but it’s quite obscure.

A more common word is RACON, but it’s also obscure.

Another possibility: RANGO (valid as a proper noun and in some dictionaries).

Given the constraints, the best next guess is RALTO to test L and T in positions 3 & 4.

RALTO is a valid 5-letter word and uses L and T which haven’t been ruled out.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-)  → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-)  → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(-)  → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(x)  → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x)  → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, O but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, O in different positions than 1, 2, 3.
- Does NOT use S or E.
- Uses two additional letters that haven’t been ruled out (i.e., not S or E).

A good next guess is “RADIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).
- D and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- O is now in position 5 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).

This should help us determine the correct positions for A, R, O and test D and I.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RADIO:

- R(✓)  → R is in the word and in the correct 1st position.
- A(✓)  → A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- D(x)  → D is NOT in the word.
- I(x)  → I is NOT in the word.
- O(✓)  → O is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So we now know the exact pattern:
R A _ _ O

We also know from the first guess that S and E are not in the word at all, and from the second guess that D and I are also not in the word.

We need two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) that:
- Are not S, E, D, or I.
- Have not been tested yet.

Common remaining consonants that fit: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words matching R A _ _ O with valid middle letters. Some possibilities:
- RABCO (but C is fine, B is fine)
- RACCO (but C is repeated, might be valid)
- RALTO (but L and T are fine)
- RAMBO (but B and M are fine)
- RAPTO (but P and T are fine)
- RATIO (but I is already ruled out)
- RAVIN (but V and N are fine, but ends with N not O)
- RAVTO (but V and T are fine, but is RAVTO a word?)

The most common and valid word fitting R A _ _ O seems to be RACON (but is RACON a valid word? Actually, RACON is a surname, not common). Another is RALTO (a type of bird). But the most common valid word is RACON or RALTO, but let me think of more common ones.

Wait, let me list more common words:
- RACON (valid but rare)
- RALTO (valid but rare)
- RAMBO (but ends with O, and B and M are fine)
- RAPTO (but P and T are fine)
- RAVIN (but ends with N)
- RAVTO (not a word)
- RACCO (not a word)
- RAGGO (but G is fine)
- RALGO (not a word)
- RAMBO is actually a valid word (RAMBO)

But RAMBO is R A M B O, which fits R A _ _ O perfectly, and uses M and B which are new and valid.

So RAMBO is a good next guess to test M and B in positions 3 and 4.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-)  → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-)  → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(-)  → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(x)  → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x)  → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, O but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, O in different positions than 1, 2, 3.
- Does NOT use S or E.
- Uses two additional letters that haven’t been ruled out (i.e., not S or E).

A good next guess is “RADIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).
- D and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- O is now in position 5 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).

This should help us determine the correct positions for A, R, O and test D and I.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RADIO:

- R(✓)  → R is in the word and in the correct 1st position.
- A(✓)  → A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- D(x)  → D is NOT in the word.
- I(x)  → I is NOT in the word.
- O(✓)  → O is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So we now know the exact pattern:
R A _ _ O

We also know from the first guess that S and E are not in the word at all, and from the second guess that D and I are also not in the word.

We need two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) that:
- Are not S, E, D, or I.
- Have not been tested yet.

Common remaining consonants that fit: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words matching R A _ _ O with valid middle letters. Some possibilities:
- RABCO (but C is fine, B is fine)
- RACCO (but C is repeated, might be valid)
- RALTO (but L and T are fine)
- RAMBO (but B and M are fine)
- RAPTO (but P and T are fine)
- RATIO (but I is already ruled out)
- RAVIN (but V and N are fine, but ends with N not O)
- RAVTO (but V and T are fine, but is RAVTO a word?)

The most common and valid word fitting R A _ _ O seems to be RACON (but is RACON a valid word? Actually, RACON is a surname, not common). Another is RALTO (a type of bird). But the most common valid word is RACON or RALTO, but let me think of more common ones.

Wait, let me list more common words:
- RACON (valid but rare)
- RALTO (valid but rare)
- RAMBO (but ends with O, and B and M are fine)
- RAPTO (but P and T are fine)
- RAVIN (but ends with N)
- RAVTO (not a word)
- RACCO (not a word)
- RAGGO (but G is fine)
- RALGO (not a word)
- RAMBO is actually a valid word (RAMBO)

But RAMBO is R A M B O, which fits R A _ _ O perfectly, and uses M and B which are new and valid.

So RAMBO is a good next guess to test M and B in positions 3 and 4.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: R A _ _ O
- Letters NOT in the word: S, E, D, I, M, B
- Letters still allowed in positions 3 & 4: any letters except S, E, D, I, M, B

Common remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y

We need two middle letters that form a valid 5-letter word starting with RA and ending with O.

Possible candidates:
- RACCO – invalid (double C, not a common word)
- RALTO – valid (type of bird, but obscure)
- RAMBO – already tried
- RAPTO – invalid (not a common word)
- RAVIN – ends with N, not O
- RAVTO – invalid
- RALGO – invalid
- RACON – valid (small town name, but obscure)
- RANGO – valid (a type of fishing line, also a town name)

The clearest valid word fitting R A _ _ O with new letters is RALTO or RACON, but RALTO is more likely a recognized word. However, RALTO is listed in dictionaries as a variant spelling of “ralt” (a dialectal term), but it’s quite obscure.

A more common word is RACON, but it’s also obscure.

Another possibility: RANGO (valid as a proper noun and in some dictionaries).

Given the constraints, the best next guess is RALTO to test L and T in positions 3 & 4.

RALTO is a valid 5-letter word and uses L and T which haven’t been ruled out.

Therefore, RALTO is the optimal next guess.

Confirmed pattern so far: R A _ _ O  
Eliminated letters: S, E, D, I, M, B, L, T  

We need two middle letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding the above).  
Remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: A (already used), O (already used), U, Y (sometimes vowel).

We’re looking for common English 5-letter words of the form R A _ _ O.

Possible candidates:
- RACCO – invalid (double C, not common)
- RAGGO – invalid
- RANKO – invalid
- RAPPO – invalid
- RAVO – too short
- RAYON – ends with N
- RAYTO – invalid
- RACON – valid (but obscure, a town name)
- RANGO – valid (a fishing line or town name)
- RAPHO – invalid
- RAVEL – ends with L (eliminated)
- RAVEN – ends with N
- RAVEN ends with N, not O.

The only clearly valid 5-letter words left are RACON and RANGO. Between them, RANGO appears more frequently in dictionaries and is thus the safer choice.

Therefore, RANGO is the next logical guess.
