1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).

- E is not in the word.

- It contains S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Next step: choose a word that fits _ _ A _ _, uses S in a different position, and avoids L/T/E. Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels left: I, O, U.

Possible candidates: CRASH (but has H, not sure), DRAIN (but has N and I), SNACK (but has N and C), or CRAMP.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 3.  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere, but NOT in position 1 or 4.  
   ⇒ Letters L, T, E are absent.  

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)  
   ⇒ R exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (already known) or 1.  
   ⇒ C and H are absent.  

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are ruled out).  
- R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.  
- Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, C, H.  
- Allowed consonants left: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Allowed vowels left: I, O, U (A is already placed).

Let’s look for a word that:
- Has A in position 3.  
- Places S in position 2 or 5.  
- Places R in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _  
  – R must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  – Possible: R S A _ _ → but “RSA??” is unlikely.  
  – Or _ S A R _ → e.g., “DSAR?” – nothing common.  
  – Or _ S A _ R → e.g., “PSA_R” – nothing common.

- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S  
  – R must be in 1, 4.  
  – If R is in 1: R _ A _ S → e.g., “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
    – “R” + I + “A” + D + “S” → “RIADS” – but D is allowed.  
    – “RIADS” is a valid 5-letter word (plural of riod).  
    – Check letters: R, I, A, D, S – all allowed.  

Another candidate: R _ A _ S → “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.

- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _  
  – R must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  – Possible: R S A _ _ → but “RSA??” is unlikely.  
  – Or _ S A R _ → e.g., “DSAR?” – nothing common.  
  – Or _ S A _ R → e.g., “PSA_R” – nothing common.

- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S  
  – R must be in 1, 4.  
  – If R is in 1: R _ A _ S → e.g., “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
    – “R” + I + “A” + D + “S” → “RIADS” – but D is allowed.  
    – “RIADS” is a valid 5-letter word (plural of riod).  
    – Check letters: R, I, A, D, S – all allowed.  

Another candidate: R _ A _ S → “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
Other vowels: O, U.  
– “ROADS” – but D is allowed, and “ROADS” is valid.  
– “RAOSS” – invalid.  
– “RUMPS” – but P is allowed, but S is already last.  

Between “RIADS” and “ROADS”, “ROADS” is more common.

So I’ll guess “ROADS”.

From the new feedback on ROADS:

R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
A(✓) → A is still fixed in position 3.  
D(x) → D is NOT in the word.

So now we know the pattern is:
_ _ A _ S

Letters we have:
- A in 3, S in 5.
- R is somewhere in 2, 3, or 4. But 3 is A, so R must be in 2 or 4.
- O is somewhere in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is A, 5 is S, so O must be in 1 or 4.
- Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, C, H, D.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
[1] [2] A [4] S
with:

- No repeats of forbidden letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 2
   Pattern: _ R A _ S
   Then O must be in position 1 or 4.
   - If O is in 1: O R A _ S → ORA_S → ORANG? but G is allowed. ORANG is 5 letters but ends with G, not S. ORASx – no.  
   - If O is in 4: _ R A O S → ?R A O S → e.g., “GRAOS” – not a word. “BRASO” – not a word. “FRASO” – no. “PRASO” – no. “TRASO” – T is forbidden.

Case 2: R in position 4
   Pattern: _ _ A R S
   Then O must be in position 1.
   → O _ A R S
   The blank (position 2) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden.  
   Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Vowels left for position 2: only possible if O is duplicated, but O is already used once and no evidence of duplicates. So position 2 must be consonant.

Wait, let me check dictionary for O _ A R S. The only common word is “OASIS”, but that ends in S and has I in 4, but our 4 is R. So none.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Next step: choose a word that fits _ _ A _ _, uses S in a different position, and avoids L/T/E. Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels left: I, O, U.

Possible candidates: CRASH (but has H, not sure), DRAIN (but has N and I), SNACK (but has N and C), or CRAMP. 

Looking for a word with S in position 2 or 4: 
- CHASM: C H A S M → S in 4th, uses C, H, M (all new letters)
- SHARK: S H A R K → S in 1st (already ruled out)
- CRASH: C R A S H → S in 4th, uses C, R, H

CRASH seems good: fits _ _ A _ _, S in 4th, no L/T/E, and introduces C, R, H.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 3.  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere, but NOT in position 1 or 4.  
   ⇒ Letters L, T, E are absent.  

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)  
   ⇒ R exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (already known) or 1.  
   ⇒ C and H are absent.  

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are ruled out).  
- R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.  
- Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, C, H.  
- Allowed consonants left: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Allowed vowels left: I, O, U (A is already placed).

Let’s look for a word that:
- Has A in position 3.  
- Places S in position 2 or 5.  
- Places R in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _  
  – R must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  – Possible: R S A _ _ → but “RSA??” is unlikely.  
  – Or _ S A R _ → e.g., “DSAR?” – nothing common.  
  – Or _ S A _ R → e.g., “PSA_R” – nothing common.

- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S  
  – R must be in 1, 4.  
  – If R is in 1: R _ A _ S → e.g., “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
    – “R” + I + “A” + D + “S” → “RIADS” – but D is allowed.  
    – “RIADS” is a valid 5-letter word (plural of riod).  
    – Check letters: R, I, A, D, S – all allowed.  

Another candidate: R _ A _ S → “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
Other vowels: O, U.  
– “ROADS” – but D is allowed, and “ROADS” is valid.  
– “RAOSS” – invalid.  
– “RUMPS” – but P is allowed, but S is already last.  

Between “RIADS” and “ROADS”, “ROADS” is more common.

So I’ll guess “ROADS”.

Letters we have:

Case 2: R in position 4

   The blank (position 2) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden.  
   Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Vowels left for position 2: only possible if O is duplicated, but O is already used once and no evidence of duplicates. So position 2 must be consonant.

F in 1, A in 3, R in 2, O in 4, S in 5.  
R is in 2 (allowed), O is in 4 (allowed), A in 3, S in 5. No forbidden letters.

So “FAROS” fits all constraints.

Let’s extract every constraint from the four rounds of feedback.

Known positions

- S is in the word and is in the correct position (position 5): _ _ _ _ S.

Forbidden letters so far  
L, T, E, C, H, D, F.

Letters that must appear somewhere  
R (from CRASH and FAROS)  
O (from ROADS and FAROS)

Letters that appear but whose positions are not yet fixed  
A (must appear once more, not in position 3)  
R (must appear once more, not in position 2)  
O (must appear once more, not in position 4)

Current pattern  
_ _ _ _ S

We need a 5-letter English word ending in S that contains both R and O exactly once each, and exactly one A, with no repeats of any forbidden letter.

Let’s list possible placements of A, R, O:

Positions available: 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is S).

We must place  
- A somewhere other than position 3  
- R somewhere other than position 2  
- O somewhere other than position 4

One valid arrangement that satisfies all these rules is  
O in 1, A in 2, R in 4 → O A _ R S

The blank (position 3) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden. Allowed consonants left: B, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a valid English word:  
O A _ R S  
The only common word that fits is “OAKRS” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“OANRS” – no.  
“OBARS” – B is allowed, but “OBARS” is not a word.  
“OGARS” – no.  
“OMARS” – no.  
“OPARS” – no.  
“OVARS” – no.  

Another arrangement:  
R in 1, O in 2, A in 4 → R O _ A S  
The blank (position 3) must be a consonant.  
Valid word: “ROBAS” – no.  
“ROGAS” – no.  
“ROMAS” – yes! “ROMAS” is the plural of “roma” (a type of cabbage) and is listed in dictionaries.

Check letters: R, O, M, A, S – all allowed, no repeats.  
Positions:  
R in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (correct), M in 3 (allowed).

Hence “ROMAS” is a valid next guess.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Next step: choose a word that fits _ _ A _ _, uses S in a different position, and avoids L/T/E. Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels left: I, O, U.

Possible candidates: CRASH (but has H, not sure), DRAIN (but has N and I), SNACK (but has N and C), or CRAMP. 

Looking for a word with S in position 2 or 4: 
- CHASM: C H A S M → S in 4th, uses C, H, M (all new letters)
- SHARK: S H A R K → S in 1st (already ruled out)
- CRASH: C R A S H → S in 4th, uses C, R, H

CRASH seems good: fits _ _ A _ _, S in 4th, no L/T/E, and introduces C, R, H.

Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 3.  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere, but NOT in position 1 or 4.  
   ⇒ Letters L, T, E are absent.  

2. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)  
   ⇒ R exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (already known) or 1.  
   ⇒ C and H are absent.  

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are ruled out).  
- R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.  
- Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, C, H.  
- Allowed consonants left: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Allowed vowels left: I, O, U (A is already placed).

Let’s look for a word that:
- Has A in position 3.  
- Places S in position 2 or 5.  
- Places R in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _  
  – R must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  – Possible: R S A _ _ → but “RSA??” is unlikely.  
  – Or _ S A R _ → e.g., “DSAR?” – nothing common.  
  – Or _ S A _ R → e.g., “PSA_R” – nothing common.

- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S  
  – R must be in 1, 4.  
  – If R is in 1: R _ A _ S → e.g., “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
    – “R” + I + “A” + D + “S” → “RIADS” – but D is allowed.  
    – “RIADS” is a valid 5-letter word (plural of riod).  
    – Check letters: R, I, A, D, S – all allowed.  

Another candidate: R _ A _ S → “R” + vowel + “A” + consonant + “S”.  
Other vowels: O, U.  
– “ROADS” – but D is allowed, and “ROADS” is valid.  
– “RAOSS” – invalid.  
– “RUMPS” – but P is allowed, but S is already last.  

Between “RIADS” and “ROADS”, “ROADS” is more common.

So I’ll guess “ROADS”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: ROADS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) A(✓) D(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROADS:

R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
A(✓) → A is still fixed in position 3.  
D(x) → D is NOT in the word.  
S(✓) → S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So now we know the pattern is:
_ _ A _ S

Letters we have:
- A in 3, S in 5.
- R is somewhere in 2, 3, or 4. But 3 is A, so R must be in 2 or 4.
- O is somewhere in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is A, 5 is S, so O must be in 1 or 4.
- Forbidden letters so far: L, T, E, C, H, D.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
[1] [2] A [4] S
with:
- R in 2 or 4
- O in 1 or 4
- No repeats of forbidden letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 2
   Pattern: _ R A _ S
   Then O must be in position 1 or 4.
   - If O is in 1: O R A _ S → ORA_S → ORANG? but G is allowed. ORANG is 5 letters but ends with G, not S. ORASx – no.  
   - If O is in 4: _ R A O S → ?R A O S → e.g., “GRAOS” – not a word. “BRASO” – not a word. “FRASO” – no. “PRASO” – no. “TRASO” – T is forbidden.

Case 2: R in position 4
   Pattern: _ _ A R S
   Then O must be in position 1.
   → O _ A R S
   The blank (position 2) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden.  
   Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Vowels left for position 2: only possible if O is duplicated, but O is already used once and no evidence of duplicates. So position 2 must be consonant.

Looking for valid English words:
O _ A R S
- “ONARS” – no.  
- “OPARS” – no.  
- “OVARS” – no.  
- “OGARS” – no.  
- “OWARS” – no.  
- “OBARS” – no.  
- “OFARS” – no.  
- “OKARS” – no.  
- “OMARS” – no.  
- “OPARS” – no.  
- “OVARS” – no.  

Wait, let me check dictionary for O _ A R S. The only common word is “OASIS”, but that ends in S and has I in 4, but our 4 is R. So none.

Alternative: Maybe O is in position 1 and R in position 4:
O _ A R S
Still no common word.

Alternative: Maybe O is in position 4 and R in position 2:
_ R A O S
Looking for ?R A O S:
- “GRASO” – no.  
- “FRASO” – no.  
- “PRASO” – no.  
- “BRASO” – no.  
- “TRASO” – T forbidden.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine constraints.

Wait, the word must be valid English. Let me think differently: what 5-letter words fit _ _ A _ S with R and O placed appropriately?

Known:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ S
- R is in 2 or 4
- O is in 1 or 4
- No D, L, T, E, C, H

- “FAROS” – yes! “FAROS” is an ancient unit of distance, also a name. It’s valid.

Check letters:
F, A, R, O, S – all allowed.  
Positions:
F in 1, A in 3, R in 2, O in 4, S in 5.  
R is in 2 (allowed), O is in 4 (allowed), A in 3, S in 5. No forbidden letters.

So “FAROS” fits all constraints.

Let’s extract every constraint from the four rounds of feedback.

Known positions  
- A is in the word, but it is NOT in position 3 (because FAROS gave A(-) instead of A(✓)).  
- S is in the word and is in the correct position (position 5): _ _ _ _ S.

Forbidden letters so far  
L, T, E, C, H, D, F.

Letters that must appear somewhere  
R (from CRASH and FAROS)  
O (from ROADS and FAROS)

Letters that appear but whose positions are not yet fixed  
A (must appear once more, not in position 3)  
R (must appear once more, not in position 2)  
O (must appear once more, not in position 4)

Current pattern  
_ _ _ _ S

We need a 5-letter English word ending in S that contains both R and O exactly once each, and exactly one A, with no repeats of any forbidden letter.

Let’s list possible placements of A, R, O:

Positions available: 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is S).

We must place  
- A somewhere other than position 3  
- R somewhere other than position 2  
- O somewhere other than position 4

One valid arrangement that satisfies all these rules is  
O in 1, A in 2, R in 4 → O A _ R S

The blank (position 3) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden. Allowed consonants left: B, G, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a valid English word:  
O A _ R S  
The only common word that fits is “OAKRS” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“OANRS” – no.  
“OBARS” – B is allowed, but “OBARS” is not a word.  
“OGARS” – no.  
“OMARS” – no.  
“OPARS” – no.  
“OVARS” – no.  

Another arrangement:  
R in 1, O in 2, A in 4 → R O _ A S  
The blank (position 3) must be a consonant.  
Valid word: “ROBAS” – no.  
“ROGAS” – no.  
“ROMAS” – yes! “ROMAS” is the plural of “roma” (a type of cabbage) and is listed in dictionaries.

Check letters: R, O, M, A, S – all allowed, no repeats.  
Positions:  
R in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (correct), M in 3 (allowed).

Hence “ROMAS” is a valid next guess.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Position 5 is definitely S (✓ in every guess since ROMAS also gave S(✓)).
2. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word:
   - A (from SLATE, CRASH, ROADS, FAROS, ROMAS)
   - R (from CRASH, ROADS, FAROS, ROMAS)
   - O (from ROADS, FAROS, ROMAS)
3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   L, T, E, C, H, D, F, M
4. Position constraints:
   - A cannot be in position 3 (FAROS gave A(-) instead of A(✓)).
   - R cannot be in position 1 (ROMAS gave R(-)).
   - R also cannot be in position 2 (from CRASH).
   - O cannot be in position 2 (from ROADS).
   - O cannot be in position 4 (from FAROS).
   - O cannot be in position 1 (from ROMAS).

Therefore, the only possible positions left for A, R, O are:
- Position 1: only A or R (but R cannot be in 1, so A must be in 1 or 4)
- Position 2: only O is possible (but O cannot be in 2) → contradiction.
Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints carefully.

Re-listing the forbidden positions:
- A: not in 3
- R: not in 1, not in 2
- O: not in 1, not in 2, not in 4

So positions available:
1: A or O (but O is forbidden here) → only A
2: A or R or O (but A is now placed in 1, so 2 can be R or O)
3: A or R or O (but A is in 1, R cannot be in 2, so 3 can be R or O)
4: A or R or O (but O is forbidden in 4) → can be A or R
5: S

But A cannot be in 3, and we still need to place A once more (since ROMAS gave A(-) meaning A is present but not in 4). So A must be in position 1 or 4.

Case 1: A in 1
Then word is A _ _ _ S
We need to place R and O in positions 2,3,4 with:
- R not in 1 or 2 → must be in 3 or 4
- O not in 1,2,4 → must be in 3

So:
A _ O _ S
R must go in 4 (only remaining spot)
→ A _ O R S

The blank (position 2) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden. Allowed consonants left: B, G, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a valid English word: A _ O R S
The only common word that fits is “ABORS” – but B is allowed and “ABORS” is listed (short for abortions, though rare). However, let’s check if any other word is more common.

Another possibility: “AGORS” – no.  
“AKORS” – no.  
“ANORS” – no.  
“APORS” – no.  
“AVORS” – no.  

“ABORS” seems to be the only valid option here.

Case 2: A in 4
Then word is _ _ _ A S
We need to place R and O in positions 1,2,3 with:
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be in 3
- O cannot be in 1,2,4 → must be in 3
But R and O cannot both be in 3 → impossible.

Thus, only Case 1 is possible: A _ O R S → “ABORS”.

But let me double-check: is there another word I missed?

Looking at A _ O R S again, the only valid English word appears to be “ABORS”.

Therefore, the next guess must be “ABORS”.

5: S

But A cannot be in 3, and we still need to place A once more (since ROMAS gave A(-) meaning A is present but not in 4). So A must be in position 1 or 4.
