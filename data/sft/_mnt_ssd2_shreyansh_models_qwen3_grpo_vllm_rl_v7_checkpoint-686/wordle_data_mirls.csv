For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)

- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R but not in position 2.

A good second guess should:
1. Include R in a new position (not 2)
2. Introduce new common letters

- TRIAL (but A is excluded)
- DRIFT (but F is less common)

  Then I and M must fit in 1,2,4 (I≠3 already).  
  Possible: M _ R I S → M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.

  Also check positions:  
  – R is in 3 (allowed)  
  – I is in 4 (allowed)  
  – M is in 1 (allowed)  
  – S is in 5 (correct)  
  – O is new and allowed.

- GROIN (but N is excluded)
- STORM (but O is less common than A/E)

Looking for words without C/A/N/E that include R and other common letters:
- STORM (S, T, O, R, M) - but O is less common
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - but F is less common
- BRIOT (B, R, I, O, T) - but O is less common
- TRIMS (T, R, I, M, S) - good, uses T, R, I, M, S

I'll choose ""TRIMS"" as it uses very common letters (T, R, I, M, S) and places R in position 2 (different from position 2 in CRANE).

Guess 2: TRIMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) M(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   - Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E  
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. TRIMS → T(x) R(-) I(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   - Letters not in the word: T (adds to C,A,N,E)  
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known) and also NOT in position 1.  
   - Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - Letter M is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - Letter S is in the word AND in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S (position 5 = S).  
- Must contain R, I, M, none of which are in their previous positions.  
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, O, U, B, G, H, P, Y, etc.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- M cannot be in position 4.  
- Position 5 is fixed as S.

Let’s list possible positions for R, I, M:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: _ _ _ _ S

R can be in 3 or 4.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4.  
M can be in 1, 2, 3.

We need to place R, I, M in positions 1-4 without violating their forbidden spots, and fill the remaining slot with a new common letter.

Try combinations:
- If R is in 3:  
  Then I and M must fit in 1,2,4 (I≠3 already).  
  Possible: M _ R I S → M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.  
  Good candidate: M O R I S → but O is less common than A/E, but allowed.  
  Check if all letters allowed: M, O, R, I, S — none are forbidden.  
  Also check positions:  
  – R is in 3 (allowed)  
  – I is in 4 (allowed)  
  – M is in 1 (allowed)  
  – S is in 5 (correct)  
  – O is new and allowed.

Another candidate: B R I M S — but R would be in 2 (forbidden).  
P R I M S — R in 2 (forbidden).  
D R I M S — R in 2 (forbidden).  

R in 4:  
Then I and M must fit in 1,2,3 (I≠3).  
Possible: I M _ R S → I M _ R S → need letter for 3.  
I M B R S → check positions:  
– I in 1 (allowed)  
– M in 2 (allowed)  
– B new and allowed  
– R in 4 (allowed)  
– S in 5 (correct).

Between MORIS and IMBRS, both fit.  
MORIS uses O (less common), IMBRS uses B (less common).  
Both are valid, but let’s pick one.

I’ll go with MORIS because O is somewhat common and it’s a valid word.

From the new feedback on MORIS:

M(✓)  → M is in position 1 and correct.

R(✓)  → R is in position 3 and correct.  
I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
S(✓)  → S is in position 5 and correct.

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Letter:   M   ?   R   ?   S  

Constraints on remaining letters:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be in 1,3,4,5).  
- Position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, A, N, E, T, O.

Available common letters to try: D, L, U, B, G, H, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with M, has R in position 3, ends with S.  
- Contains I in either position 2 or 4.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. M I R _ S → need a letter for position 4.  
2. M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns.

Pattern 1: M I R _ S  
Possible: M I R K S, M I R L S, M I R D S, M I R B S…  
Check dictionary: MIRKS is not a common word. MIRLS, MIRD, MIRBS — none are valid.

Pattern 2: M _ R I S  
Possible: M D R I S, M B R I S, M G R I S, M H R I S…  
Check dictionary:  
- M B R I S → “MBRIS” is not a recognized English word.  
- M D R I S → “MDRIS” is not recognized.  
- M G R I S → “MGRI S” is not a word.  
- M P R I S → “MPRIS” is not a word.  
- M L R I S → “MLRIS” is not a word.  
- M U R I S → “MURIS” is not standard.  
- M Y R I S → “MYRIS” is a variant spelling of myris, but not common.

Wait, let’s double-check pattern 1 again with more common letters:  
M I R K S — not a word.  
M I R L S — not a word.  
M I R D S — not a word.  
M I R G S — not a word.  

Let me think of actual English words that fit M _ R I S:

- MURIS (not standard)  
- MIRIS (not standard)  
- MURKS (but K is allowed, and it fits M U R K S, but that would require I in position 4 and K in position 2, but we have pattern M _ R I S, so position 2 is K, position 4 is I: M K R I S — not a word).  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns carefully:

We have positions: M _ R _ S  
and I must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible words:
- M I R _ S → need position 4.  
- M _ R I S → need position 2.

Looking for actual words:

1. M I R K S — not a word.  
2. M I R L S — not a word.  
3. M I R D S — not a word.  
4. M I R B S — not a word.  

5. M _ R I S:  
   - M B R I S — not a word.  
   - M D R I S — not a word.  
   - M G R I S — not a word.  
   - M H R I S — not a word.  
   - M L R I S — not a word.  
   - M P R I S — not a word.  
   - M U R I S — not a word.  
   - M Y R I S — not a word.  

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I missed a simpler word: M I R I S — but that repeats I, and we don’t know if I can appear twice. The feedback only says I is in the word once (since it was marked “-” in TRIMS and “-” again in MORIS, meaning it’s in the word but not in that position). It doesn’t specify uniqueness.

So M I R I S is actually a valid English word (meaning a thimble or the plant Iris). Let’s check constraints:
- M in 1 ✓  
- I in 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in 4)  
- R in 3 ✓  
- I in 4 (allowed, since the previous “-” only forbade position 4 in MORIS, not globally)  
- S in 5 ✓  

Also, letters used: M, I, R, S — all allowed, no forbidden letters.

Thus, the word must be M I R I S.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R but not in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N, E.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing R in a different position. Good remaining common letters are S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Include R in a new position (not 2)
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid any of C, A, N, E

Possible candidates:
- TRIAL (but A is excluded)
- DRIFT (but F is less common)
- BRIAR (but A is excluded)
- GROIN (but N is excluded)
- STORM (but O is less common than A/E)

Looking for words without C/A/N/E that include R and other common letters:
- STORM (S, T, O, R, M) - but O is less common
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - but F is less common
- BRIOT (B, R, I, O, T) - but O is less common
- TRIMS (T, R, I, M, S) - good, uses T, R, I, M, S

I'll choose ""TRIMS"" as it uses very common letters (T, R, I, M, S) and places R in position 2 (different from position 2 in CRANE).

   - Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - Letter M is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - Letter S is in the word AND in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S (position 5 = S).  
- Must contain R, I, M, none of which are in their previous positions.  
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, O, U, B, G, H, P, Y, etc.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- M cannot be in position 4.  
- Position 5 is fixed as S.

Let’s list possible positions for R, I, M:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: _ _ _ _ S

R can be in 3 or 4.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4.  
M can be in 1, 2, 3.

We need to place R, I, M in positions 1-4 without violating their forbidden spots, and fill the remaining slot with a new common letter.

Try combinations:
- If R is in 3:  
  Then I and M must fit in 1,2,4 (I≠3 already).  
  Possible: M _ R I S → M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.  
  Good candidate: M O R I S → but O is less common than A/E, but allowed.  
  Check if all letters allowed: M, O, R, I, S — none are forbidden.  
  Also check positions:  
  – R is in 3 (allowed)  
  – I is in 4 (allowed)  
  – M is in 1 (allowed)  
  – S is in 5 (correct)  
  – O is new and allowed.

Another candidate: B R I M S — but R would be in 2 (forbidden).  
P R I M S — R in 2 (forbidden).  
D R I M S — R in 2 (forbidden).  

R in 4:  
Then I and M must fit in 1,2,3 (I≠3).  
Possible: I M _ R S → I M _ R S → need letter for 3.  
I M B R S → check positions:  
– I in 1 (allowed)  
– M in 2 (allowed)  
– B new and allowed  
– R in 4 (allowed)  
– S in 5 (correct).

Between MORIS and IMBRS, both fit.  
MORIS uses O (less common), IMBRS uses B (less common).  
Both are valid, but let’s pick one.

I’ll go with MORIS because O is somewhat common and it’s a valid word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRIMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) M(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: MORIS -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) R(✓) I(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on MORIS:

M(✓)  → M is in position 1 and correct.  
O(x)  → O is not in the word at all.  
R(✓)  → R is in position 3 and correct.  
I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
S(✓)  → S is in position 5 and correct.

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Letter:   M   ?   R   ?   S  

Constraints on remaining letters:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be in 1,3,4,5).  
- Position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, A, N, E, T, O.

Available common letters to try: D, L, U, B, G, H, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with M, has R in position 3, ends with S.  
- Contains I in either position 2 or 4.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. M I R _ S → need a letter for position 4.  
2. M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns.

Pattern 1: M I R _ S  
Possible: M I R K S, M I R L S, M I R D S, M I R B S…  
Check dictionary: MIRKS is not a common word. MIRLS, MIRD, MIRBS — none are valid.

Pattern 2: M _ R I S  
Possible: M D R I S, M B R I S, M G R I S, M H R I S…  
Check dictionary:  
- M B R I S → “MBRIS” is not a recognized English word.  
- M D R I S → “MDRIS” is not recognized.  
- M G R I S → “MGRI S” is not a word.  
- M P R I S → “MPRIS” is not a word.  
- M L R I S → “MLRIS” is not a word.  
- M U R I S → “MURIS” is not standard.  
- M Y R I S → “MYRIS” is a variant spelling of myris, but not common.

Wait, let’s double-check pattern 1 again with more common letters:  
M I R K S — not a word.  
M I R L S — not a word.  
M I R D S — not a word.  
M I R G S — not a word.  

Let me think of actual English words that fit M _ R I S:

- MURIS (not standard)  
- MIRIS (not standard)  
- MURKS (but K is allowed, and it fits M U R K S, but that would require I in position 4 and K in position 2, but we have pattern M _ R I S, so position 2 is K, position 4 is I: M K R I S — not a word).  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns carefully:

We have positions: M _ R _ S  
and I must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible words:
- M I R _ S → need position 4.  
- M _ R I S → need position 2.

Looking for actual words:

1. M I R K S — not a word.  
2. M I R L S — not a word.  
3. M I R D S — not a word.  
4. M I R B S — not a word.  

5. M _ R I S:  
   - M B R I S — not a word.  
   - M D R I S — not a word.  
   - M G R I S — not a word.  
   - M H R I S — not a word.  
   - M L R I S — not a word.  
   - M P R I S — not a word.  
   - M U R I S — not a word.  
   - M Y R I S — not a word.  

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I missed a simpler word: M I R I S — but that repeats I, and we don’t know if I can appear twice. The feedback only says I is in the word once (since it was marked “-” in TRIMS and “-” again in MORIS, meaning it’s in the word but not in that position). It doesn’t specify uniqueness.

So M I R I S is actually a valid English word (meaning a thimble or the plant Iris). Let’s check constraints:
- M in 1 ✓  
- I in 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in 4)  
- R in 3 ✓  
- I in 4 (allowed, since the previous “-” only forbade position 4 in MORIS, not globally)  
- S in 5 ✓  

Also, letters used: M, I, R, S — all allowed, no forbidden letters.

Thus, the word must be M I R I S.

We know:

  The only remaining spot for I is position 2, but position 2 is already M I R _ S → position 2 is I, which is correct.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R but not in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N, E.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing R in a different position. Good remaining common letters are S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Include R in a new position (not 2)
2. Introduce new common letters
3. Avoid any of C, A, N, E

Possible candidates:
- TRIAL (but A is excluded)
- DRIFT (but F is less common)
- BRIAR (but A is excluded)
- GROIN (but N is excluded)
- STORM (but O is less common than A/E)

Looking for words without C/A/N/E that include R and other common letters:
- STORM (S, T, O, R, M) - but O is less common
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - but F is less common
- BRIOT (B, R, I, O, T) - but O is less common
- TRIMS (T, R, I, M, S) - good, uses T, R, I, M, S

I'll choose ""TRIMS"" as it uses very common letters (T, R, I, M, S) and places R in position 2 (different from position 2 in CRANE).

   - Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - Letter M is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - Letter S is in the word AND in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S (position 5 = S).  
- Must contain R, I, M, none of which are in their previous positions.  
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, O, U, B, G, H, P, Y, etc.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- M cannot be in position 4.  
- Position 5 is fixed as S.

Let’s list possible positions for R, I, M:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: _ _ _ _ S

R can be in 3 or 4.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4.  
M can be in 1, 2, 3.

We need to place R, I, M in positions 1-4 without violating their forbidden spots, and fill the remaining slot with a new common letter.

Try combinations:
- If R is in 3:  
  Then I and M must fit in 1,2,4 (I≠3 already).  
  Possible: M _ R I S → M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.  
  Good candidate: M O R I S → but O is less common than A/E, but allowed.  
  Check if all letters allowed: M, O, R, I, S — none are forbidden.  
  Also check positions:  
  – R is in 3 (allowed)  
  – I is in 4 (allowed)  
  – M is in 1 (allowed)  
  – S is in 5 (correct)  
  – O is new and allowed.

Another candidate: B R I M S — but R would be in 2 (forbidden).  
P R I M S — R in 2 (forbidden).  
D R I M S — R in 2 (forbidden).  

R in 4:  
Then I and M must fit in 1,2,3 (I≠3).  
Possible: I M _ R S → I M _ R S → need letter for 3.  
I M B R S → check positions:  
– I in 1 (allowed)  
– M in 2 (allowed)  
– B new and allowed  
– R in 4 (allowed)  
– S in 5 (correct).

Between MORIS and IMBRS, both fit.  
MORIS uses O (less common), IMBRS uses B (less common).  
Both are valid, but let’s pick one.

I’ll go with MORIS because O is somewhat common and it’s a valid word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRIMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) M(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: MORIS -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) R(✓) I(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on MORIS:

M(✓)  → M is in position 1 and correct.  
O(x)  → O is not in the word at all.  
R(✓)  → R is in position 3 and correct.  
I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
S(✓)  → S is in position 5 and correct.

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Letter:   M   ?   R   ?   S  

Constraints on remaining letters:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be in 1,3,4,5).  
- Position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, A, N, E, T, O.

Available common letters to try: D, L, U, B, G, H, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with M, has R in position 3, ends with S.  
- Contains I in either position 2 or 4.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. M I R _ S → need a letter for position 4.  
2. M _ R I S → need a letter for position 2.

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns.

Pattern 1: M I R _ S  
Possible: M I R K S, M I R L S, M I R D S, M I R B S…  
Check dictionary: MIRKS is not a common word. MIRLS, MIRD, MIRBS — none are valid.

Pattern 2: M _ R I S  
Possible: M D R I S, M B R I S, M G R I S, M H R I S…  
Check dictionary:  
- M B R I S → “MBRIS” is not a recognized English word.  
- M D R I S → “MDRIS” is not recognized.  
- M G R I S → “MGRI S” is not a word.  
- M P R I S → “MPRIS” is not a word.  
- M L R I S → “MLRIS” is not a word.  
- M U R I S → “MURIS” is not standard.  
- M Y R I S → “MYRIS” is a variant spelling of myris, but not common.

Wait, let’s double-check pattern 1 again with more common letters:  
M I R K S — not a word.  
M I R L S — not a word.  
M I R D S — not a word.  
M I R G S — not a word.  

Let me think of actual English words that fit M _ R I S:

- MURIS (not standard)  
- MIRIS (not standard)  
- MURKS (but K is allowed, and it fits M U R K S, but that would require I in position 4 and K in position 2, but we have pattern M _ R I S, so position 2 is K, position 4 is I: M K R I S — not a word).  

Wait, let me re-examine the patterns carefully:

We have positions: M _ R _ S  
and I must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible words:
- M I R _ S → need position 4.  
- M _ R I S → need position 2.

Looking for actual words:

1. M I R K S — not a word.  
2. M I R L S — not a word.  
3. M I R D S — not a word.  
4. M I R B S — not a word.  

5. M _ R I S:  
   - M B R I S — not a word.  
   - M D R I S — not a word.  
   - M G R I S — not a word.  
   - M H R I S — not a word.  
   - M L R I S — not a word.  
   - M P R I S — not a word.  
   - M U R I S — not a word.  
   - M Y R I S — not a word.  

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I missed a simpler word: M I R I S — but that repeats I, and we don’t know if I can appear twice. The feedback only says I is in the word once (since it was marked “-” in TRIMS and “-” again in MORIS, meaning it’s in the word but not in that position). It doesn’t specify uniqueness.

So M I R I S is actually a valid English word (meaning a thimble or the plant Iris). Let’s check constraints:
- M in 1 ✓  
- I in 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in 4)  
- R in 3 ✓  
- I in 4 (allowed, since the previous “-” only forbade position 4 in MORIS, not globally)  
- S in 5 ✓  

Also, letters used: M, I, R, S — all allowed, no forbidden letters.

Thus, the word must be M I R I S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRIMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) M(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: MORIS -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) R(✓) I(-) S(✓)
Guess 4: MIRIS -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) I(✓) R(✓) I(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 4 (MIRIS) we now have:

M(✓)  → position 1 = M  
I(✓)  → position 2 = I  
R(✓)  → position 3 = R  
I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already satisfied, since we have I in position 2)  
S(✓)  → position 5 = S  

So the pattern is now completely fixed:

M I R _ S

The only unknown is position 4.  
We know:
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, O  
- I must appear somewhere, but positions 1,2,3,5 are taken by M,I,R,S respectively, and I cannot be in position 4 (from MORIS feedback).  
  Therefore I cannot appear at all, which contradicts the earlier “I is in the word”.  
  Wait — the feedback for I in MORIS was “-” (in word but wrong position), and in MIRIS it was again “-” for position 4.  
  The only remaining spot for I is position 2, but position 2 is already M I R _ S → position 2 is I, which is correct.  
  So I is already placed correctly at position 2, and cannot appear elsewhere.  

Hence position 4 must be a letter not yet used and not forbidden.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form M I R _ S.

Common dictionary check:
- M I R K S → “mirks” (valid)  
- M I R B S → not a word  
- M I R D S → “mirds” (not standard)  
- M I R L S → “mirls” (not standard)  
- M I R G S → “mirgs” (not standard)  
- M I R F S → “mirfs” (not standard)  
- M I R H S → “mirhs” (not standard)  

The only common valid word is M I R K S.

Let’s verify:
- M I R K S  
  – M(✓) I(✓) R(✓) K(?) S(✓)  
  – K has never been tested and is not forbidden.  
  – All constraints satisfied.

Therefore the next (and likely final) guess is “mirks”.
