### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Is a valid English word

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A (not in position 1 or 2)
- R (not in position 1 or 2)
- O (not in position 3 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I

So the hidden word must contain A, R, O and two other letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, D, I). The remaining common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have positional constraints:
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → R must be in 3, 4, or 5
- O cannot be in slot 3 or 5 → O must be in 2 or 4

Let’s list possible placements that satisfy these rules and still allow valid English words.

One systematic way is to enumerate the possible positions for A, R, O under the constraints and fill the remaining two slots with unused letters.

For example:
- O must be in 2 or 4
- A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5

Case 1: O in slot 2
Then A and R must be in 3,4,5 without overlap.
Sub-cases:
- A in 3 → R in 4 or 5
- A in 4 → R in 3 or 5
- A in 5 → R in 3 or 4

Case 2: O in slot 4
Then A and R must be in 3 and 5 (since 4 is taken by O)
- A in 3 → R in 5
- A in 5 → R in 3

Let’s explore valid English words under these patterns.

From Case 1.1: O in 2, A in 3, R in 4 → pattern _ O A R _
Remaining letters (from allowed set): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible first and fifth letters: need valid word.

Looking for _ O A R _:
Possible words: COBAR, FOAMY (but F,O,A,M,Y - M and Y are allowed), HOARD (but D is excluded), LOAMY, MOATS (but S excluded), ROAST (S excluded), TOADY, WORAN (but N allowed), etc.

LOAMY: L, O, A, M, Y - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R missing? Wait, this pattern has R in 4, so LOAMY doesn't fit because it lacks R.

Oops, I need to ensure both A and R are present. So for _ O A R _, the word must have O, A, R in those positions plus two more letters.

But _ O A R _ is only 5 letters, so it's O in 2, A in 3, R in 4. That's three letters fixed. The first and fifth must be from allowed letters.

Looking for words matching ?OAR? with allowed letters:
Possible: BOARS (but S excluded), COARS (S excluded), FOAMY (but no R), HOARD (D excluded), JOARS (not a word), LOARS (not a word), MOARS (not a word), NOARS (not a word), TOARS (not a word), VOARS (not a word), WOARS (not a word), XOARS (not a word), YOARS (not a word), ZOARS (not a word).

None seem valid. Let's try Case 1.2: O in 2, A in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Pattern: _ O R A _ or _ O _ A R

For _ O R A _:
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.
Possible: BORAL (but L allowed), CORAL, FORAY (but Y allowed), HORAL (not a word), MORAL, PORAL (not a word), TORAN (but N allowed).

CORAL: C, O, R, A, L - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- C and L are new letters from allowed set.

This fits perfectly.

Let’s confirm:
- Contains A, R, O
- No S, E, D, I
- A not in 1 or 2 (it's in 4) ✓
- R not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3) ✓
- O not in 3 or 5 (it's in 2) ✓

Therefore, CORAL is a valid next guess.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:

- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A (not in position 1 or 2)
- R (not in position 1 or 2)
- O (not in position 3 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I

So the hidden word must contain A, R, O and two other letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, D, I). The remaining common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have positional constraints:
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → R must be in 3, 4, or 5
- O cannot be in slot 3 or 5 → O must be in 2 or 4

Let’s list possible placements that satisfy these rules and still allow valid English words.

One systematic way is to enumerate the possible positions for A, R, O under the constraints and fill the remaining two slots with unused letters.

For example:
- O must be in 2 or 4
- A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5

Case 1: O in slot 2
Then A and R must be in 3,4,5 without overlap.
Sub-cases:
- A in 3 → R in 4 or 5
- A in 4 → R in 3 or 5
- A in 5 → R in 3 or 4

Case 2: O in slot 4
Then A and R must be in 3 and 5 (since 4 is taken by O)
- A in 3 → R in 5
- A in 5 → R in 3

Let’s explore valid English words under these patterns.

From Case 1.1: O in 2, A in 3, R in 4 → pattern _ O A R _
Remaining letters (from allowed set): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible first and fifth letters: need valid word.

Looking for _ O A R _:
Possible words: COBAR, FOAMY (but F,O,A,M,Y - M and Y are allowed), HOARD (but D is excluded), LOAMY, MOATS (but S excluded), ROAST (S excluded), TOADY, WORAN (but N allowed), etc.

LOAMY: L, O, A, M, Y - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R missing? Wait, this pattern has R in 4, so LOAMY doesn't fit because it lacks R.

Oops, I need to ensure both A and R are present. So for _ O A R _, the word must have O, A, R in those positions plus two more letters.

But _ O A R _ is only 5 letters, so it's O in 2, A in 3, R in 4. That's three letters fixed. The first and fifth must be from allowed letters.

Looking for words matching ?OAR? with allowed letters:
Possible: BOARS (but S excluded), COARS (S excluded), FOAMY (but no R), HOARD (D excluded), JOARS (not a word), LOARS (not a word), MOARS (not a word), NOARS (not a word), TOARS (not a word), VOARS (not a word), WOARS (not a word), XOARS (not a word), YOARS (not a word), ZOARS (not a word).

None seem valid. Let's try Case 1.2: O in 2, A in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Pattern: _ O R A _ or _ O _ A R

For _ O R A _:
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.
Possible: BORAL (but L allowed), CORAL, FORAY (but Y allowed), HORAL (not a word), MORAL, PORAL (not a word), TORAN (but N allowed).

CORAL: C, O, R, A, L - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- C and L are new letters from allowed set.

This fits perfectly.

Let’s confirm:
- Contains A, R, O
- No S, E, D, I
- A not in 1 or 2 (it's in 4) ✓
- R not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3) ✓
- O not in 3 or 5 (it's in 2) ✓

Therefore, CORAL is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (✓)

Known letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- A (because it got “-” in both CORAL and RADIO, meaning it’s in the word but not in the positions tried so far)

Known letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I, C, L

So the hidden word looks like:
_ O R _ _

and must contain A somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 4, or 5), while using only letters not yet ruled out.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones and the ones already placed):
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with:
- A exactly once
- two other allowed letters (can be the same or different)

And the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A in position 1 → A O R _ _
Pattern 2: A in position 4 → _ O R A _
Pattern 3: A in position 5 → _ O R _ A

Now check each pattern for valid words using allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A O R _ _
Possible 5-letter words starting with AOR:
AORAL (but L is forbidden)
AORTA (but T is allowed, second T is allowed)
AORIC (C is forbidden)
So the only valid candidate is AORTA.

Check constraints:
- A in 1: allowed (not forbidden)
- O in 2: ✓
- R in 3: ✓
- T in 4 and 5: T is allowed
- No forbidden letters
- Contains A (in 1), R, O

FORGO (G allowed, but O is already in 2, so FORGO has O in 2 and 4 – duplicate O, but that’s okay; however F, O, R, G, O – but we only know one O exists; might be invalid)
GORAL (L is forbidden)
HORAL (L is forbidden)
JORAH (H allowed)
KORAN (N allowed)
MORAL (L is forbidden)
PORCH (H allowed)

- JORAH: J, O, R, A, H – all allowed
- KORAN: K, O, R, A, N – all allowed
- PORCH: P, O, R, C, H – C is forbidden
- TORAH: T, O, R, A, H – all allowed

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Is a valid English word

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

- A is in the word but not in position 1.

- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O somewhere.
- Does NOT contain S or E.
- A cannot be in slot 1, R cannot be in slot 2, O cannot be in slot 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:

2. Avoids S and E.
3. Places A not in position 1, R not in position 2, O not in position 3.

- R (not in position 1 or 2)
- O (not in position 3 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I

So the hidden word must contain A, R, O and two other letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, D, I). The remaining common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have positional constraints:
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → R must be in 3, 4, or 5
- O cannot be in slot 3 or 5 → O must be in 2 or 4

Let’s list possible placements that satisfy these rules and still allow valid English words.

One systematic way is to enumerate the possible positions for A, R, O under the constraints and fill the remaining two slots with unused letters.

For example:
- O must be in 2 or 4
- A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5

Case 1: O in slot 2
Then A and R must be in 3,4,5 without overlap.
Sub-cases:
- A in 3 → R in 4 or 5
- A in 4 → R in 3 or 5
- A in 5 → R in 3 or 4

Case 2: O in slot 4
Then A and R must be in 3 and 5 (since 4 is taken by O)
- A in 3 → R in 5
- A in 5 → R in 3

Let’s explore valid English words under these patterns.

From Case 1.1: O in 2, A in 3, R in 4 → pattern _ O A R _
Remaining letters (from allowed set): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible first and fifth letters: need valid word.

Looking for _ O A R _:
Possible words: COBAR, FOAMY (but F,O,A,M,Y - M and Y are allowed), HOARD (but D is excluded), LOAMY, MOATS (but S excluded), ROAST (S excluded), TOADY, WORAN (but N allowed), etc.

LOAMY: L, O, A, M, Y - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R missing? Wait, this pattern has R in 4, so LOAMY doesn't fit because it lacks R.

Oops, I need to ensure both A and R are present. So for _ O A R _, the word must have O, A, R in those positions plus two more letters.

But _ O A R _ is only 5 letters, so it's O in 2, A in 3, R in 4. That's three letters fixed. The first and fifth must be from allowed letters.

Looking for words matching ?OAR? with allowed letters:
Possible: BOARS (but S excluded), COARS (S excluded), FOAMY (but no R), HOARD (D excluded), JOARS (not a word), LOARS (not a word), MOARS (not a word), NOARS (not a word), TOARS (not a word), VOARS (not a word), WOARS (not a word), XOARS (not a word), YOARS (not a word), ZOARS (not a word).

None seem valid. Let's try Case 1.2: O in 2, A in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Pattern: _ O R A _ or _ O _ A R

For _ O R A _:
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.
Possible: BORAL (but L allowed), CORAL, FORAY (but Y allowed), HORAL (not a word), MORAL, PORAL (not a word), TORAN (but N allowed).

CORAL: C, O, R, A, L - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- C and L are new letters from allowed set.

This fits perfectly.

Let’s confirm:
- Contains A, R, O
- No S, E, D, I
- A not in 1 or 2 (it's in 4) ✓
- R not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3) ✓
- O not in 3 or 5 (it's in 2) ✓

Therefore, CORAL is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: CORAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) R(✓) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Known letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (✓)

Known letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- A (because it got “-” in both CORAL and RADIO, meaning it’s in the word but not in the positions tried so far)

Known letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I, C, L

So the hidden word looks like:
_ O R _ _

and must contain A somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 4, or 5), while using only letters not yet ruled out.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones and the ones already placed):
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with:
- A exactly once
- two other allowed letters (can be the same or different)

And the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A in position 1 → A O R _ _
Pattern 2: A in position 4 → _ O R A _
Pattern 3: A in position 5 → _ O R _ A

Now check each pattern for valid words using allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A O R _ _
Possible 5-letter words starting with AOR:
AORAL (but L is forbidden)
AORTA (but T is allowed, second T is allowed)
AORIC (C is forbidden)
So the only valid candidate is AORTA.

Check constraints:
- A in 1: allowed (not forbidden)
- O in 2: ✓
- R in 3: ✓
- T in 4 and 5: T is allowed
- No forbidden letters
- Contains A (in 1), R, O
- No S, E, D, I, C, L

Pattern 2: _ O R A _
Possible words:
BORAX (B, X allowed)
FORGO (G allowed, but O is already in 2, so FORGO has O in 2 and 4 – duplicate O, but that’s okay; however F, O, R, G, O – but we only know one O exists; might be invalid)
GORAL (L is forbidden)
HORAL (L is forbidden)
JORAH (H allowed)
KORAN (N allowed)
MORAL (L is forbidden)
PORCH (H allowed)
TORAH (H allowed)

Valid candidates: BORAX, FORGO, JORAH, KORAN, PORCH, TORAH

Check each:
- BORAX: B, O, R, A, X – all allowed
- FORGO: F, O, R, G, O – has two O’s, but we only know one O is confirmed; possible
- JORAH: J, O, R, A, H – all allowed
- KORAN: K, O, R, A, N – all allowed
- PORCH: P, O, R, C, H – C is forbidden
- TORAH: T, O, R, A, H – all allowed

So valid candidates from pattern 2: BORAX, FORGO, JORAH, KORAN, TORAH

Pattern 3: _ O R _ A
Possible words:
BROKA (K allowed, but A is last)
FROZA (Z allowed)
GROBA (B allowed)
HORLA (L forbidden)
JORA B (not a word)
MORQA (Q allowed)
PROZA (Z allowed)
TORQA (Q allowed)

Valid candidates: BROKA, FROZA, GROBA, PROZA, TORQA

Among all patterns, the most straightforward valid word is AORTA (pattern 1).

Let’s choose AORTA as it fits all constraints and is a common word.

Let's extract every constraint revealed so far.

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: R

Confirmed letters that must appear:
- A (already placed at 5)
- O (already placed at 2)

Excluded letters (never appear):
S, E, D, I, C, L, T

So the pattern is:

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching ?OR?A.

Let's list possible combinations:

Position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 4: same set, possibly same letter

Scanning common words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Is a valid English word

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O somewhere.
- Does NOT contain S or E.
- A cannot be in slot 1, R cannot be in slot 2, O cannot be in slot 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O (each at least once).
2. Avoids S and E.
3. Places A not in position 1, R not in position 2, O not in position 3.

Possible candidates: RADIO, RATIO, TORAN, RONDA, etc.
Let me pick RADIO:
- Uses R, A, D, I, O.
- Contains A, R, O.
- No S or E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A can't be in 1).
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O can't be in 3).

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A (not in position 1 or 2)
- R (not in position 1 or 2)
- O (not in position 3 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I

So the hidden word must contain A, R, O and two other letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, D, I). The remaining common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have positional constraints:
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R cannot be in slot 1 or 2 → R must be in 3, 4, or 5
- O cannot be in slot 3 or 5 → O must be in 2 or 4

Let’s list possible placements that satisfy these rules and still allow valid English words.

One systematic way is to enumerate the possible positions for A, R, O under the constraints and fill the remaining two slots with unused letters.

For example:
- O must be in 2 or 4
- A must be in 3, 4, or 5
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5

Case 1: O in slot 2
Then A and R must be in 3,4,5 without overlap.
Sub-cases:
- A in 3 → R in 4 or 5
- A in 4 → R in 3 or 5
- A in 5 → R in 3 or 4

Case 2: O in slot 4
Then A and R must be in 3 and 5 (since 4 is taken by O)
- A in 3 → R in 5
- A in 5 → R in 3

Let’s explore valid English words under these patterns.

From Case 1.1: O in 2, A in 3, R in 4 → pattern _ O A R _
Remaining letters (from allowed set): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible first and fifth letters: need valid word.

Looking for _ O A R _:
Possible words: COBAR, FOAMY (but F,O,A,M,Y - M and Y are allowed), HOARD (but D is excluded), LOAMY, MOATS (but S excluded), ROAST (S excluded), TOADY, WORAN (but N allowed), etc.

LOAMY: L, O, A, M, Y - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R missing? Wait, this pattern has R in 4, so LOAMY doesn't fit because it lacks R.

Oops, I need to ensure both A and R are present. So for _ O A R _, the word must have O, A, R in those positions plus two more letters.

But _ O A R _ is only 5 letters, so it's O in 2, A in 3, R in 4. That's three letters fixed. The first and fifth must be from allowed letters.

Looking for words matching ?OAR? with allowed letters:
Possible: BOARS (but S excluded), COARS (S excluded), FOAMY (but no R), HOARD (D excluded), JOARS (not a word), LOARS (not a word), MOARS (not a word), NOARS (not a word), TOARS (not a word), VOARS (not a word), WOARS (not a word), XOARS (not a word), YOARS (not a word), ZOARS (not a word).

None seem valid. Let's try Case 1.2: O in 2, A in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Pattern: _ O R A _ or _ O _ A R

For _ O R A _:
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.
Possible: BORAL (but L allowed), CORAL, FORAY (but Y allowed), HORAL (not a word), MORAL, PORAL (not a word), TORAN (but N allowed).

CORAL: C, O, R, A, L - all allowed letters, valid word.
Check constraints:
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- C and L are new letters from allowed set.

This fits perfectly.

Let’s confirm:
- Contains A, R, O
- No S, E, D, I
- A not in 1 or 2 (it's in 4) ✓
- R not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3) ✓
- O not in 3 or 5 (it's in 2) ✓

Therefore, CORAL is a valid next guess.

- S, E, D, I, C, L

So the hidden word looks like:
_ O R _ _

and must contain A somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 4, or 5), while using only letters not yet ruled out.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones and the ones already placed):
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with:
- A exactly once
- two other allowed letters (can be the same or different)

And the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A in position 1 → A O R _ _
Pattern 2: A in position 4 → _ O R A _
Pattern 3: A in position 5 → _ O R _ A

Now check each pattern for valid words using allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A O R _ _
Possible 5-letter words starting with AOR:
AORAL (but L is forbidden)
AORTA (but T is allowed, second T is allowed)
AORIC (C is forbidden)
So the only valid candidate is AORTA.

Check constraints:
- A in 1: allowed (not forbidden)
- O in 2: ✓
- R in 3: ✓
- T in 4 and 5: T is allowed
- No forbidden letters
- Contains A (in 1), R, O
- No S, E, D, I, C, L

Pattern 2: _ O R A _
Possible words:
BORAX (B, X allowed)
FORGO (G allowed, but O is already in 2, so FORGO has O in 2 and 4 – duplicate O, but that’s okay; however F, O, R, G, O – but we only know one O exists; might be invalid)
GORAL (L is forbidden)
HORAL (L is forbidden)
JORAH (H allowed)
KORAN (N allowed)
MORAL (L is forbidden)
PORCH (H allowed)
TORAH (H allowed)

Valid candidates: BORAX, FORGO, JORAH, KORAN, PORCH, TORAH

Check each:
- BORAX: B, O, R, A, X – all allowed
- FORGO: F, O, R, G, O – has two O’s, but we only know one O is confirmed; possible
- JORAH: J, O, R, A, H – all allowed
- KORAN: K, O, R, A, N – all allowed
- PORCH: P, O, R, C, H – C is forbidden
- TORAH: T, O, R, A, H – all allowed

So valid candidates from pattern 2: BORAX, FORGO, JORAH, KORAN, TORAH

Pattern 3: _ O R _ A
Possible words:
BROKA (K allowed, but A is last)
FROZA (Z allowed)
GROBA (B allowed)
HORLA (L forbidden)
JORA B (not a word)
MORQA (Q allowed)
PROZA (Z allowed)
TORQA (Q allowed)

Valid candidates: BROKA, FROZA, GROBA, PROZA, TORQA

Among all patterns, the most straightforward valid word is AORTA (pattern 1).

Let’s choose AORTA as it fits all constraints and is a common word.

Let's extract every constraint revealed so far.

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: A

Confirmed letters that must appear:
- A (already placed at 5)
- O (already placed at 2)
- R (already placed at 3)

Excluded letters (never appear):
S, E, D, I, C, L, T

So the pattern is:
_  O  R  _  A

The missing letters (positions 1 and 4) must be chosen only from the remaining alphabet:
Allowed set = {B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching ?OR?A.

Let's list possible combinations:

Position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 4: same set, possibly same letter

Scanning common words:
- BORRA – not valid
- FORGA – not valid
- GORGE – contains E (excluded)
- HORLA – L excluded
- JORAH – valid (name, but accepted in word lists)
- MORRA – valid (slang for ""more"")
- PORGA – not valid
- QORRA – not valid
- UROTA – T excluded
- VORRA – not valid
- WORRA – not valid
- XORRA – not valid
- YORRA – not valid
- ZORRA – not valid

The most plausible valid words are:
- JORAH
- MORRA

Both fit the pattern and constraints. Since ""MORRA"" is more commonly recognized as a word (slang term), we'll choose it.
