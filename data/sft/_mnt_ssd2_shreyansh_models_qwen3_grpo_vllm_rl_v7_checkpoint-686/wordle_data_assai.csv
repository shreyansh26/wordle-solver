### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal many letters that might be in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

Between these, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better because it covers similar high-frequency letters but positions them differently. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: S, A
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and A.
2. Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3.

Good candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is less common)
- BASIN (but has N, which is okay)
- PASSE (but has E, which we know is out)
- SASSY (but has S twice, and Y is less common)
- SCARF (but has F, which is less common)

A better choice might be ""CRASH"" because it includes S and A, avoids L/T/E, and positions S in spot 3 and A in spot 2. But let me think of something simpler.

Actually, ""ARSON"" is a strong candidate:
- Contains A and S
- Does not contain L, T, or E
- A is in position 1 (allowed, since original A was in position 3)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since original S was in position 1)

But wait, does ""ARSON"" have any of the forbidden letters? No L, T, or E. Good.

Another option is ""SCRAN"" (a type of fish), but that's less common. ""ARSON"" seems better.

But let me think of a more common word. ""SANDY"" has Y, which is less common. ""SABIN"" is possible but less common.

Actually, ""SCARF"" is a good one:
- S in position 1 (but original S was in position 1 and marked wrong position, so this is bad)
Wait, original S was in position 1 and marked (-), so S cannot be in position 1 again. So ""SCARF"" is invalid.

""CARBS"":
- C, A, R, B, S
- Contains A and S
- No L, T, E
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)

This seems good. ""CARBS"" is a common word meaning carbonated beverages.

Let me verify:
- Letters: C, A, R, B, S
- No L, T, E
- A not in position 3 (it's in 2) - ok
- S not in position 1 (it's in 5) - ok

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

What we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, C, R, B  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, A  

Constraints so far:
- S must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (it was marked wrong in both those spots).
- A must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (it was marked wrong there).

Therefore:
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains both S and A.
2. Uses none of the letters L, T, E, C, R, B.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Places A in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters we can use: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit:

- ADIOS (A in 1, S in 4) – but contains I and O, which are vowels; also has D.
- ASIDE – but contains E (forbidden).
- ANGEL – contains E and L (both forbidden).
- AFOUL – contains L (forbidden).
- AGONY – contains N, G, O, Y; A in 1, S not present (so skip).
- AHEAD – contains E (forbidden).
- ADOPT – contains P, D, O, T (T forbidden).
- ANGEL – already ruled out.
- AMISS – contains S twice; S in 4 is allowed, but A in 2 is forbidden (original A was in 2 and marked wrong).
- ASIDE – E forbidden.
- ADIOS – A in 1, S in 4; letters are A, D, I, O, S – none of the forbidden letters. This looks valid.

Let’s double-check ADIOS:
- Letters: A, D, I, O, S – none of L, T, E, C, R, B.
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (allowed).
- It’s a valid English word meaning “praise” or “applause.”

No conflicts, so ADIOS is a solid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal many letters that might be in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

Between these, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better because it covers similar high-frequency letters but positions them differently. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: S, A
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and A.
2. Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3.

Good candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is less common)
- BASIN (but has N, which is okay)
- PASSE (but has E, which we know is out)
- SASSY (but has S twice, and Y is less common)
- SCARF (but has F, which is less common)

A better choice might be ""CRASH"" because it includes S and A, avoids L/T/E, and positions S in spot 3 and A in spot 2. But let me think of something simpler.

Actually, ""ARSON"" is a strong candidate:
- Contains A and S
- Does not contain L, T, or E
- A is in position 1 (allowed, since original A was in position 3)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since original S was in position 1)

But wait, does ""ARSON"" have any of the forbidden letters? No L, T, or E. Good.

Another option is ""SCRAN"" (a type of fish), but that's less common. ""ARSON"" seems better.

But let me think of a more common word. ""SANDY"" has Y, which is less common. ""SABIN"" is possible but less common.

Actually, ""SCARF"" is a good one:
- S in position 1 (but original S was in position 1 and marked wrong position, so this is bad)
Wait, original S was in position 1 and marked (-), so S cannot be in position 1 again. So ""SCARF"" is invalid.

""CARBS"":
- C, A, R, B, S
- Contains A and S
- No L, T, E
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)

This seems good. ""CARBS"" is a common word meaning carbonated beverages.

Let me verify:
- Letters: C, A, R, B, S
- No L, T, E
- A not in position 3 (it's in 2) - ok
- S not in position 1 (it's in 5) - ok

""CARBS"" seems like a strong second guess.

What we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, C, R, B  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, A  

Constraints so far:
- S must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (it was marked wrong in both those spots).
- A must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (it was marked wrong there).

Therefore:
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains both S and A.
2. Uses none of the letters L, T, E, C, R, B.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Places A in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters we can use: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit:

- ADIOS (A in 1, S in 4) – but contains I and O, which are vowels; also has D.
- ASIDE – but contains E (forbidden).
- ANGEL – contains E and L (both forbidden).
- AFOUL – contains L (forbidden).
- AGONY – contains N, G, O, Y; A in 1, S not present (so skip).
- AHEAD – contains E (forbidden).
- ADOPT – contains P, D, O, T (T forbidden).
- ANGEL – already ruled out.
- AMISS – contains S twice; S in 4 is allowed, but A in 2 is forbidden (original A was in 2 and marked wrong).
- ASIDE – E forbidden.
- ADIOS – A in 1, S in 4; letters are A, D, I, O, S – none of the forbidden letters. This looks valid.

Let’s double-check ADIOS:
- Letters: A, D, I, O, S – none of L, T, E, C, R, B.
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (allowed).
- It’s a valid English word meaning “praise” or “applause.”

No conflicts, so ADIOS is a solid next guess.

- S is in position 4 (allowed).
- It’s a valid English word meaning “praise” or “applause.”

No conflicts, so ADIOS is a solid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

Guess 3: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x) S(-)

Now we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
2. CARBS → C(x) A(-) R(x) B(x) S(-)
3. ADIOS → A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x) S(-)

What we know for certain:
- A is in position 1 (✓).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, C, R, B, D, O  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, I  
Letters already placed: A in position 1

Constraints so far:
- A is fixed in position 1.
- S must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked wrong in those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore S can only be in position 2.
- I must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 3 (it was marked wrong there).  
  Possible positions for I: 2, 4, 5, but position 2 is already taken by S, so I must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word looks like:
A S _ I _   or   A S _ _ I

Letters left to use (excluding forbidden ones): F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Starts with AS
2. Contains I in position 4 or 5
3. Uses only allowed letters

Candidate words:
- ASKIN – but K is allowed, letters: A, S, K, I, N – none forbidden. I is in 4, S in 2 – fits all constraints.
- ASHIN – H is allowed, letters: A, S, H, I, N – fits.
- ASWIN – W is allowed, letters: A, S, W, I, N – fits.
- ASPIN – P is allowed, letters: A, S, P, I, N – fits.

Among these, ""ASKIN"" is a valid English word (archaic for ""to put on a cloak,"" or a surname), but may be obscure. ""ASHIN"" is more common (a variant of ""ashen"" or a surname). ""ASWIN"" is also a surname. ""ASPIN"" is less common.

The safest common choice is ""ASHIN.""

Let's verify:
- A in 1 (✓)
- S in 2 (only remaining spot for S)
- H in 3 (new letter, allowed)
- I in 4 (only remaining spot for I)
- N in 5 (new letter, allowed)

No forbidden letters used. Perfect.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal many letters that might be in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

Between these, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better because it covers similar high-frequency letters but positions them differently. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: S, A
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and A.
2. Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3.

Good candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is less common)
- BASIN (but has N, which is okay)
- PASSE (but has E, which we know is out)
- SASSY (but has S twice, and Y is less common)
- SCARF (but has F, which is less common)

A better choice might be ""CRASH"" because it includes S and A, avoids L/T/E, and positions S in spot 3 and A in spot 2. But let me think of something simpler.

Actually, ""ARSON"" is a strong candidate:
- Contains A and S
- Does not contain L, T, or E
- A is in position 1 (allowed, since original A was in position 3)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since original S was in position 1)

But wait, does ""ARSON"" have any of the forbidden letters? No L, T, or E. Good.

Another option is ""SCRAN"" (a type of fish), but that's less common. ""ARSON"" seems better.

But let me think of a more common word. ""SANDY"" has Y, which is less common. ""SABIN"" is possible but less common.

Actually, ""SCARF"" is a good one:
- S in position 1 (but original S was in position 1 and marked wrong position, so this is bad)
Wait, original S was in position 1 and marked (-), so S cannot be in position 1 again. So ""SCARF"" is invalid.

""CARBS"":
- C, A, R, B, S
- Contains A and S
- No L, T, E
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)

This seems good. ""CARBS"" is a common word meaning carbonated beverages.

Let me verify:
- Letters: C, A, R, B, S
- No L, T, E
- A not in position 3 (it's in 2) - ok
- S not in position 1 (it's in 5) - ok

What we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, C, R, B  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, A  

Constraints so far:
- S must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (it was marked wrong in both those spots).
- A must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (it was marked wrong there).

Therefore:
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains both S and A.
2. Uses none of the letters L, T, E, C, R, B.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Places A in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters we can use: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit:

- ADIOS (A in 1, S in 4) – but contains I and O, which are vowels; also has D.
- ASIDE – but contains E (forbidden).
- ANGEL – contains E and L (both forbidden).
- AFOUL – contains L (forbidden).
- AGONY – contains N, G, O, Y; A in 1, S not present (so skip).
- AHEAD – contains E (forbidden).
- ADOPT – contains P, D, O, T (T forbidden).
- ANGEL – already ruled out.
- AMISS – contains S twice; S in 4 is allowed, but A in 2 is forbidden (original A was in 2 and marked wrong).
- ASIDE – E forbidden.
- ADIOS – A in 1, S in 4; letters are A, D, I, O, S – none of the forbidden letters. This looks valid.

Let’s double-check ADIOS:
- Letters: A, D, I, O, S – none of L, T, E, C, R, B.
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (allowed).
- It’s a valid English word meaning “praise” or “applause.”

No conflicts, so ADIOS is a solid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CARBS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(x) B(x) S(-)
Guess 3: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x) S(-)
Guess 4: ASHIN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(✓) H(x) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
2. CARBS → C(x) A(-) R(x) B(x) S(-)
3. ADIOS → A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x) S(-)
4. ASHIN → A(✓) S(✓) H(x) I(-) N(x)

What we know for certain:
- A is in position 1 (✓).
- S is in position 2 (✓).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, C, R, B, D, O, H, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I  
Letters already placed: A in 1, S in 2

Remaining positions: 3, 4, 5  
Constraints on I: it must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 3 (it was marked wrong there).  
Therefore I must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word looks like:
A S _ I _   or   A S _ _ I

Letters left to use (excluding forbidden ones): F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Starts with AS
2. Contains I in position 4 or 5
3. Uses only allowed letters

Candidate words:
- ASKIM – but M is allowed, letters: A, S, K, I, M – fits all constraints (I in 4).
- ASKPI – invalid (not a word).
- ASKVI – invalid.
- ASPIM – invalid.
- ASKIM is the only valid word here.

""ASKIM"" is a valid English word (a variant of ""askew"" or a surname).

Let's verify:
- A in 1 (✓), S in 2 (✓)
- K in 3 (new letter, allowed)
- I in 4 (only remaining spot for I)
- M in 5 (new letter, allowed)

No forbidden letters used. Perfect.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal many letters that might be in the secret word.\n\nHowever, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:\n- S: very common starting letter\n- L: common consonant\n- A: common vowel\n- T: very common consonant\n- E: most common vowel\n\nBetween these, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better because it covers similar high-frequency letters but positions them differently.

No L, T, or E. Good.\n\nAnother option is ""SCRAN"" (a type of fish), but that\'s less common. ""ARSON"" seems better.\n\nBut let me think of a more common word. ""SANDY"" has Y, which is less common. ""SABIN"" is possible but less common.\n\nActually, ""SCARF"" is a good one:\n- S in position 1 (but original S was in position 1 and marked wrong position, so this is bad)\nWait, original S was in position 1 and marked (-), so S cannot be in position 1 again.
