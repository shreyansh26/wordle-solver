For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This combination should provide good feedback about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S.
2. Avoids A, R, E.
3. Has O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Has S somewhere other than position 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for a word with O and S, and common remaining consonants. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Uses O (in position 2) and S is not present, so I need a word that includes S.
- Let me try ""SOUND"":
  - S (position 1), O (position 2), U, N, D.
  - This covers S and O, avoids A/R/E, and positions are different.
But ""SOUND"" uses U, which is less common. 

Another option: ""SLOTH""
- S (position 1), L, O (position 3), T, H.
But O is in position 3, which was marked wrong for O.

Next: ""STONY""
- S (position 1), T, O (position 3), N, Y.
Again O in position 3 is bad.

Try ""SNOUT"":
- S (position 1), N, O (position 3), U, T.
Same issue with O in position 3.

Let me place O in position 2: ""COSMY"" – but Y is uncommon.
""COSTY"" – same issue.

Better: ""SPOUT""
- S (position 1), P, O (position 3), U, T.
Still O in position 3.

Let me place O in position 4: ""SLOTH"" already tried.

Wait, let me try ""SOLID"":
- S (position 1), O (position 2), L, I, D.
This has O in position 2 (new position), and S in position 1 (new position). Avoids A/R/E. Uses common letters.

This seems good.

- Must contain S and D (both confirmed in the word).
- Must NOT contain A, R, E, L, I.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S.
2. Avoids A, R, E.
3. Has O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Has S somewhere other than position 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for a word with O and S, and common remaining consonants. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Uses O (in position 2) and S is not present, so I need a word that includes S.
- Let me try ""SOUND"":
  - S (position 1), O (position 2), U, N, D.
  - This covers S and O, avoids A/R/E, and positions are different.
But ""SOUND"" uses U, which is less common. 

Another option: ""SLOTH""
- S (position 1), L, O (position 3), T, H.
But O is in position 3, which was marked wrong for O.

Next: ""STONY""
- S (position 1), T, O (position 3), N, Y.
Again O in position 3 is bad.

Try ""SNOUT"":
- S (position 1), N, O (position 3), U, T.
Same issue with O in position 3.

Let me place O in position 2: ""COSMY"" – but Y is uncommon.
""COSTY"" – same issue.

Better: ""SPOUT""
- S (position 1), P, O (position 3), U, T.
Still O in position 3.

Let me place O in position 4: ""SLOTH"" already tried.

Wait, let me try ""SOLID"":
- S (position 1), O (position 2), L, I, D.
This has O in position 2 (new position), and S in position 1 (new position). Avoids A/R/E. Uses common letters.

This seems good.

I’ll look for a word that:

- Uses only the allowed letters.

Option 1: S in position 3 → _ O S _ _
   Then D must be in 1 or 4.
   - D O S _ _ : Need two more letters. Example: DOSER – but E is banned.
   - _ O S D _ : Need first and fifth letters. Try BOSDD – invalid (D repeated).
   - _ O S _ D : Need first and fourth. Try M O S N D – but N is allowed, but MOSND isn’t a word.

Option 2: S in position 5 → _ O _ _ S
   Then D must be in 1, 3, or 4.
   - D O _ _ S : Need third and fourth. Try DOUGH – but H is allowed, U is allowed, G is allowed. DOUGH is a valid word.
   - Check constraints: D in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (locked), U in 3 (allowed), G in 4 (allowed), H in 5 (allowed). S in 5 (allowed). No banned letters. This fits.

Let me verify DOUGH:
- Contains S (position 5) and D (position 1).

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, E, L, I, U, H):

B, C, F, J, K, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- S must be in the word (from earlier feedback) and cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from SOLID: S not in 1, and from AROSE: S not in 4). 
- The only remaining positions for S are 3 or 5.

But position 3 is currently empty (D O _ G _). Let’s check:

If S is in position 3: D O S G _
   Then position 5 must be one of the allowed letters. The only common 5-letter word fitting is DOSGN? No. DOSGM? No. DOSGY? No. Doesn’t seem valid.

If S is in position 5: D O _ G S
   Then position 3 must be one of the allowed letters. Let’s list possible letters for position 3: B, C, F, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

None of these are valid words. This suggests S must be in position 3, and we need a valid 5-letter word D O S G _.

Looking again, the only valid word seems to be DOSING, but that’s 6 letters. DOSGS isn’t a word. DOSGY isn’t either.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and positions. The word must be D O _ G _ with S in position 3 and the fifth letter from the remaining allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with DOSG...:
- DOSGO – no
- DOSGS – no
- DOSGY – no

This seems impossible. Let me re-check the constraints.

Ah! I realize now: the word must be D O _ G _ and S must be in position 3 or 5. Position 5 is S, so the word is D O _ G S. The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet excluded.

Looking at common English words: D O _ G S

The only valid word is DOGGS (but that’s plural of dog, and G is already in position 4, so DOGGS would have two G’s – but G is confirmed only in position 4, so it could be possible). However, DOGGS is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

If S is in position 3: D O S G _
   Then position 5 must be one of the allowed letters. The only common 5-letter word fitting is DOSGN? No. DOSGM? No. DOSGY? No. Doesn’t seem valid.

If S is in position 5: D O _ G S
   Then position 3 must be one of the allowed letters. Let’s list possible letters for position 3: B, C, F, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words fitting D O _ G S:
- DOBGS – no
- DOCGS – no
- DOFGS – no
- DOKGS – no
- DOMGS – no
- DONGS – no
- DOPGS – no
- DOQGS – no
- DOTGS – no
- DOVGS – no
- DOWGS – no
- DOXGS – no
- DYOGS – no
- DZOGS – no

None of these are valid words. This suggests S must be in position 3, and we need a valid 5-letter word D O S G _.

Looking again, the only valid word seems to be DOSING, but that’s 6 letters. DOSGS isn’t a word. DOSGY isn’t either.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and positions. The word must be D O _ G _ with S in position 3 and the fifth letter from the remaining allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with DOSG...:
- DOSGO – no
- DOSGS – no
- DOSGY – no

This seems impossible. Let me re-check the constraints.

Ah! I realize now: the word must be D O _ G _ and S must be in position 3 or 5. Position 5 is S, so the word is D O _ G S. The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet excluded.

Looking at common English words: D O _ G S

The only valid word is DOGGS (but that’s plural of dog, and G is already in position 4, so DOGGS would have two G’s – but G is confirmed only in position 4, so it could be possible). However, DOGGS is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- D in 1 (✓)
- O in 2 (✓)
- G in 4 (✓)
- S in 5 (allowed, and S must be in word)
- No banned letters (A, R, E, L, I, U, H)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 5) – OK
- D not in 5 (it’s in 1) – OK

DOGGS fits all constraints.

Wait, let's re-examine the allowed letters and possible combinations. The only valid word fitting D O _ G S is ""DOGGS"" which we already tried. This suggests there might be an error in our constraints.

Rechecking constraints:
- From DOUGH: D(✓) O(✓) U(x) G(✓) H(x) → G is in position 4 (✓)

Thus, the word must be D O _ G S with position 3 being any allowed letter. The only valid English word fitting this is ""DONGS"".

Let's verify:
- DONGS: D(1) O(2) N(3) G(4) S(5)
- Contains S (position 5) and D (position 1) as required
