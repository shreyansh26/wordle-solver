For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in English words.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, E

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in it (but not in position 2)
2. Does not contain C, A, N, E
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Good letters to test next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible words:
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - R in position 2, but we know R isn't in position 2, so skip
- STORM (S, T, O, R, M) - R in position 4 (valid), no forbidden letters
- BIRTH (B, I, R, T, H) - R in position 3 (valid), no forbidden letters
- DROOL (D, R, O, O, L) - R in position 2 (invalid), skip

- Contain S (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 allowed).
- Exclude C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.
Letters we know ARE in the word: R, S.

We need a 5-letter word using only remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.) while placing R and S appropriately.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, E

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in it (but not in position 2)
2. Does not contain C, A, N, E
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Good letters to test next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible words:
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - R in position 2, but we know R isn't in position 2, so skip
- STORM (S, T, O, R, M) - R in position 4 (valid), no forbidden letters
- BIRTH (B, I, R, T, H) - R in position 3 (valid), no forbidden letters
- DROOL (D, R, O, O, L) - R in position 2 (invalid), skip

""STORM"" seems good as it tests S, T, O, M while placing R in position 4.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STORM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. STORM → S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, O, M are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must:
- Contain R (positions 1, 3, 5 allowed).
- Contain S (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 allowed).
- Exclude C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.
Letters we know ARE in the word: R, S.

We need a 5-letter word using only remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.) while placing R and S appropriately.

Candidate words:
- DRIPS – R in position 2 (invalid, R not allowed here).
- BRISK – R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 4.
- FRISS – R in position 2 (invalid).
- PRISM – R in position 2 (invalid), M excluded.
- URBIC – C excluded.
- BURPS – R in position 2 (invalid).
- DRUID – R in position 2 (invalid).
- FURRY – R in position 3 (valid), S missing.
- BURRS – R in position 4 (valid), S missing.
- BURPS – S in position 5 (valid), R in position 3 (valid).

""BURPS"" fits:
- B, U, P, S, R.
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- No excluded letters.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. STORM → S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - T, O, M are not in the word.
   - R is in the word, not in position 4.

3. BURPS → B(x) U(x) R(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - B, U, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word, not in position 3.
   - S is in the correct position (position 5).

Current constraints:
- Word must contain: R and S.
- S is in position 5.
- R must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 4).
- Letters excluded so far: C, A, N, E, T, O, M, B, U, P.
- Remaining candidate letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, V, W, Y, etc.

So the word looks like: R _ _ _ S, with the middle three letters drawn from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
- R D I V S
- R I S S S (but S is already in position 5, and we don't have info on duplicates)
- R I G H S
- R I V E S (E excluded)
- R I V E S (invalid)
- R I V A S (A excluded)
- R I V E S (invalid)
- R I V E S (invalid)

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting R _ _ _ S:
- RIVYS (not a word)
- RIVAS (A excluded)
- RIVEL (not ending in S)
- RIFLS (not common)
- RIGID (doesn't end in S)
- RIGOL (doesn't end in S)
- RIKIS (not a word)
- RILKS (not a word)
- RIVET (T excluded)
- RIVEL (doesn't end in S)
- RIVES (E excluded)
- RIVYS (not a word)
- RIVUS (U excluded)
- RIVAS (A excluded)

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word is R I D G S (but ""ridgs"" isn't valid). Or R I D D S (invalid). 

Actually, looking at valid English words:
- RIVUS (invalid, U excluded)
- RIFLS (not a word)
- RIKIS (not a word)
- RILKS (not a word)
- RIGID (doesn't end in S)
- RIGOL (doesn't end in S)
- RIVET (T excluded)
- RIVES (E excluded)
- RIVAS (A excluded)

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let me re-examine possible letters. The remaining letters are: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for R _ _ _ S words:
- R I D G S (invalid)
- R I D D S (invalid)
- R I G H S (invalid)
- R I L K S (invalid)
- R I V E S (E excluded)
- R I V E S (invalid)
- R I V E S (invalid)

Wait, let's consider ""RIGHS"" - but that's not a valid word. ""RIFHS"" - invalid.

Actually, ""RIGID"" is a word but doesn't end in S. 

Looking at valid words ending in S with R in position 1:
- RIGID (doesn't end in S)
- RIFLE (ends in E, excluded)
- RIVET (T excluded)
- RIVES (E excluded)
- RIKIS (invalid)
- RILKS (invalid)
- RIFTS (T excluded)
- RIGGS (G repeated, but G is allowed)
- RIGGS (valid word: R-I-G-G-S)

""RIGGS"" fits:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (correct)
- Letters used: R, I, G, G, S
- All letters are from allowed set (no excluded letters)
- R is in position 1 (not 2,3,4 - correct)
- S is in position 5 (correct)

This seems to be the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the word must start with R and end with S, with no C, A, N, E, T, O, M, B, U, P. The remaining letters include D, F, G, H, I, K, L, V, W, Y. The valid word fitting these constraints is ""RIGGS"".

We now know the exact pattern: R I _ _ S, and the two missing letters (positions 3 and 4) cannot be any of the following letters:
- Excluded by earlier feedback: C, A, N, E, T, O, M, B, U, P, G, F
- Remaining alphabet letters still allowed: D, H, K, L, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form R I _ _ S using only these remaining letters for the two blanks.

Looking at the possible combinations:
- R I D _ S → R I D D S (invalid), R I D K S (invalid), R I D L S (invalid)
- R I H _ S → R I H D S (invalid), R I H K S (invalid), R I H L S (invalid)
- R I K _ S → R I K D S (invalid), R I K H S (invalid), R I K L S (invalid)
- R I L _ S → R I L D S (invalid), R I L H K S (invalid)
- R I V _ S → R I V D S (invalid), R I V H S (invalid), R I V K L S (invalid)
- R I W _ S → R I W D S (invalid), R I W H K L S (invalid)
- R I Y _ S → R I Y D H K L V W S (invalid)

The only valid English word fitting R I _ _ S with these constraints is R I D D S, but that's not a valid word. 

However, upon closer inspection, ""RIDDY"" is a valid word but doesn't end with S. The correct valid word ending in S with R I _ _ S is actually ""RIDDY"" which is invalid, indicating we might have missed a valid word.

But looking again, the only valid word fitting R I _ _ S with the allowed letters is ""RIDDY"" which is invalid, suggesting we need to re-examine.

Wait, let's list all valid English words matching R I _ _ S:
- RIFFS (already tried, F excluded)
- RIGGS (already tried, G excluded)
- RILLS (L allowed)
- RINSE (N and E excluded)
- RIVET (T excluded)
- RIVYS (invalid)
- RIKIS (invalid)
- RILKS (invalid)
- RIFLE (E excluded)
- RIFTS (T excluded)
- RIGOL (invalid)
- RIGID (doesn't end in S)

The valid remaining word is ""RILLS"":
- R I L L S
- L is allowed (not excluded)
- Double L is acceptable
- This fits all constraints

Thus, the correct guess is ""RILLS"".
