### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities early.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage across the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

All five letters in SLATE were marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters and vowels.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  
- Letter known to be in the word but not yet placed: O (from ROUND, where O got “-”)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O exactly once.  
- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D.

Remaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency): C, H, I, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters not yet eliminated and includes the letter O exactly once.  
A good next guess should test several fresh consonants and the vowel I (since we’ve only tested O so far).  
The word “CHIMP” uses C, H, I, M, P—none of which have been ruled out—and doesn’t contain O.  
But we want to test O, so we need to include it.

Let’s build a word with O plus four fresh letters.  
A simple, common word that fits is “COBIM” (but that’s not a valid English word).  
Another candidate: “COMPI” (also not valid).  
“COBIA” contains A (ruled out).  
“COHIP” isn’t valid.  
“COBOW” isn’t valid.  
“COMFY” uses F, Y—both still allowed.

Wait, let’s pick “COMFY”:
- C, O, M, F, Y  
- All letters are still allowed.  
- O appears once, giving us the feedback we need to confirm its position or find another slot.

But to maximize information, let’s try a word that places O in a new position and tests new letters.  
“YOGIC” uses Y, O, G, I, C—none ruled out.  
“COGIC” isn’t valid.  
“GIOC” isn’t valid.  
“COYIC” isn’t valid.  
“COBIA” ruled out.  
“COMFY” seems the most valid remaining option.

Actually, let’s use “YOGIC” even if it’s less common; it’s valid and tests Y, G, I, C plus O.

But to stay with more common letters, let’s use “COMFY”.

I’ll go with “COMFY” as it uses very common remaining letters and tests O.

These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities early.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (very common ending letter)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis should give good coverage across the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in SLATE were marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  \nThat eliminates a large chunk of common letters and vowels.  \nFor the next guess, I want to use entirely different letters—preferably ones that are still fairly common but weren’t in SLATE.  \nGood candidates: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, etc.  \n\nA balanced word using five fresh letters is “ROUND”:\n- R – common consonant  \n- O – common vowel (not A or E)  \n- U – second common vowel  \n- N – common consonant  \n- D – common consonant  \n\nThis should give fresh information while avoiding every letter already ruled out.\n\n<guess>ROUND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n\n- Letters ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  \n- Letter known to be in the word but not yet placed: O (from ROUND, where O got “-”)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains the letter O exactly once.  \n- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D.\n\nRemaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency): C, H, I, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that uses only letters not yet eliminated and includes the letter O exactly once.  \nA good next guess should test several fresh consonants and the vowel I (since we’ve only tested O so far).  \nThe word “CHIMP” uses C, H, I, M, P—none of which have been ruled out—and doesn’t contain O.  \nBut we want to test O, so we need to include it.\n\nLet’s build a word with O plus four fresh letters.  \nA simple, common word that fits is “COBIM” (but that’s not a valid English word).  \nAnother candidate: “COMPI” (also not valid).  \n“COBIA” contains A (ruled out).  \n“COHIP” isn’t valid.  \n“COBOW” isn’t valid.  \n“COMFY” uses F, Y—both still allowed.\n\nWait, let’s pick “COMFY”:\n- C, O, M, F, Y  \n- All letters are still allowed.  \n- O appears once, giving us the feedback we need to confirm its position or find another slot.\n\nBut to maximize information, let’s try a word that places O in a new position and tests new letters.  \n“YOGIC” uses Y, O, G, I, C—none ruled out.  \n“COGIC” isn’t valid.  \n“GIOC” isn’t valid.  \n“COYIC” isn’t valid.  \n“COBIA” ruled out.  \n“COMFY” seems the most valid remaining option.\n\nActually, let’s use “YOGIC” even if it’s less common; it’s valid and tests Y, G, I, C plus O.\n\nBut to stay with more common letters, let’s use “COMFY”.\n\nI’ll go with “COMFY” as it uses very common remaining letters and tests O.\n\n<guess>COMFY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) M(x) F(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
So far we have:

- Letters completely ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, Y  
- Letter known to be in the word but not yet placed: O (from both ROUND and COMFY)

Remaining common letters (alphabetically): B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains the letter O exactly once (since it only got “-” feedback twice and we have no confirmation of duplicates).
2. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set above.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words meeting these constraints:
- B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W are still allowed.
- Possible candidates: BOGIE, JOCKO, GHOUL (but L is out), etc.

Let’s pick a word that tests several new letters and places O in a new spot.  
“BOGIE” uses B, O, G, I, E – but E is already ruled out.  
“JOCKO” uses J, O, C, K, O – C is ruled out and it has two O’s.  
“GHOBI” isn’t a valid English word.  
“PIVOT” uses P, I, V, O, T – T is ruled out.  
“WHOOO” isn’t valid.  
“GHOUL” uses L (ruled out).  
“WOBBI” isn’t valid.  
“VOGUE” uses U (ruled out) and E (ruled out).  
“GROIN” uses R and N (ruled out).  
“BOINK” uses N (ruled out).  
“BOGUS” uses S (ruled out).  
“BOBBY” uses B twice and Y (ruled out).  
“JOKER” uses R (ruled out).  
“PIVOT” uses T (ruled out).  
“GHOUL” ruled out.  
“PIKED” uses D and E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities early.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage across the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters and vowels.  
For the next guess, I want to use entirely different letters—preferably ones that are still fairly common but weren’t in SLATE.  
Good candidates: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, etc.  

A balanced word using five fresh letters is “ROUND”:
- R – common consonant  
- O – common vowel (not A or E)  
- U – second common vowel  
- N – common consonant  
- D – common consonant  

This should give fresh information while avoiding every letter already ruled out.

<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  
- Letter known to be in the word but not yet placed: O (from ROUND, where O got “-”)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O exactly once.  
- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D.

Remaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency): C, H, I, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters not yet eliminated and includes the letter O exactly once.  
A good next guess should test several fresh consonants and the vowel I (since we’ve only tested O so far).  
The word “CHIMP” uses C, H, I, M, P—none of which have been ruled out—and doesn’t contain O.  
But we want to test O, so we need to include it.

Let’s build a word with O plus four fresh letters.  
A simple, common word that fits is “COBIM” (but that’s not a valid English word).  
Another candidate: “COMPI” (also not valid).  
“COBIA” contains A (ruled out).  
“COHIP” isn’t valid.  
“COBOW” isn’t valid.  
“COMFY” uses F, Y—both still allowed.

Wait, let’s pick “COMFY”:
- C, O, M, F, Y  
- All letters are still allowed.  
- O appears once, giving us the feedback we need to confirm its position or find another slot.

But to maximize information, let’s try a word that places O in a new position and tests new letters.  
“YOGIC” uses Y, O, G, I, C—none ruled out.  
“COGIC” isn’t valid.  
“GIOC” isn’t valid.  
“COYIC” isn’t valid.  
“COBIA” ruled out.  
“COMFY” seems the most valid remaining option.

Actually, let’s use “YOGIC” even if it’s less common; it’s valid and tests Y, G, I, C plus O.

But to stay with more common letters, let’s use “COMFY”.

I’ll go with “COMFY” as it uses very common remaining letters and tests O.

So far we have:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, Y

Letter that **is** in the word but whose position is still unknown:  
O (it appeared in both ROUND and COMFY with “-” feedback, so it must be present exactly once, but not in position 2 or 3).

Remaining alphabet letters that have **never** been guessed and are therefore still possible:  
B, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, J

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Contains the letter O exactly once.  
- Uses only letters from the “never guessed” list above (no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, Y).  
- Places O in a new position (positions 1, 4, or 5 so far are still open).

A quick scan of valid 5-letter words with only the remaining letters and one O gives:

- BOGIE (B, O, G, I, E) – but E is already ruled out.  
- JOCKY – contains C and K, but C is ruled out.  
- PIVOT – contains T, ruled out.  
- GLOBE – contains E, ruled out.  
- WICKY – contains C, ruled out.  
- VOGUE – contains U and E, ruled out.  
- HOPPI – two P’s, but P is allowed; however, it has no O in the word, so it’s irrelevant.  
- PIKOW – contains W and K, but O is in position 4 here, and all letters are allowed.

Let me verify PIKOW:
- P, I, K, O, W  
- All letters are in the “never guessed” set.  
- O appears once, in position 4 – a new placement for it.

PIKOW is a valid English word (a small coin or piece of currency in some countries).

Therefore, PIKOW is a good next guess.

S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, Y

Letter that **is** in the word but whose position is still unknown:  
O (it appeared in both ROUND and COMFY with “-” feedback, so it must be present exactly once, but not in position 2 or 3).

Remaining alphabet letters that have **never** been guessed and are therefore still possible:  
B, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, J

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Contains the letter O exactly once.  
- Uses only letters from the “never guessed” list above (no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, Y).  
- Places O in a new position (positions 1, 4, or 5 so far are still open).

A quick scan of valid 5-letter words with only the remaining letters and one O gives:

- BOGIE (B, O, G, I, E) – but E is already ruled out.  
- JOCKY – contains C and K, but C is ruled out.  
- PIVOT – contains T, ruled out.  
- GLOBE – contains E, ruled out.  
- WICKY – contains C, ruled out.  
- VOGUE – contains U and E, ruled out.  
- HOPPI – two P’s, but P is allowed; however, it has no O in the word, so it’s irrelevant.  
- PIKOW – contains W and K, but O is in position 4 here, and all letters are allowed.

Let me verify PIKOW:
- P, I, K, O, W  
- All letters are in the “never guessed” set.  
- O appears once, in position 4 – a new placement for it.

PIKOW is a valid English word (a small coin or piece of currency in some countries).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities early.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage across the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters and vowels.  
For the next guess, I want to use entirely different letters—preferably ones that are still fairly common but weren’t in SLATE.  
Good candidates: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, etc.  

A balanced word using five fresh letters is “ROUND”:
- R – common consonant  
- O – common vowel (not A or E)  
- U – second common vowel  
- N – common consonant  
- D – common consonant  

This should give fresh information while avoiding every letter already ruled out.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  
- Letter known to be in the word but not yet placed: O (from ROUND, where O got “-”)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O exactly once.  
- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D.

Remaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency): C, H, I, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters not yet eliminated and includes the letter O exactly once.  
A good next guess should test several fresh consonants and the vowel I (since we’ve only tested O so far).  
The word “CHIMP” uses C, H, I, M, P—none of which have been ruled out—and doesn’t contain O.  
But we want to test O, so we need to include it.

Let’s build a word with O plus four fresh letters.  
A simple, common word that fits is “COBIM” (but that’s not a valid English word).  
Another candidate: “COMPI” (also not valid).  
“COBIA” contains A (ruled out).  
“COHIP” isn’t valid.  
“COBOW” isn’t valid.  
“COMFY” uses F, Y—both still allowed.

Wait, let’s pick “COMFY”:
- C, O, M, F, Y  
- All letters are still allowed.  
- O appears once, giving us the feedback we need to confirm its position or find another slot.

But to maximize information, let’s try a word that places O in a new position and tests new letters.  
“YOGIC” uses Y, O, G, I, C—none ruled out.  
“COGIC” isn’t valid.  
“GIOC” isn’t valid.  
“COYIC” isn’t valid.  
“COBIA” ruled out.  
“COMFY” seems the most valid remaining option.

Actually, let’s use “YOGIC” even if it’s less common; it’s valid and tests Y, G, I, C plus O.

But to stay with more common letters, let’s use “COMFY”.

I’ll go with “COMFY” as it uses very common remaining letters and tests O.
