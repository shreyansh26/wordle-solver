2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

None of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller pool of candidates.  
Common remaining high-frequency letters are:  
- S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q, N (but N is already out).

A good next guess should use fresh, common letters to narrow things down.  
Let’s pick a word that uses S, T, I, O, L, and avoids the eliminated letters.

Candidate words:  
- STOIL (not valid)  
- STOIC (valid)  
- STOIL (invalid)  
- STOIC is valid and uses S, T, O, I, C – but C is eliminated.  
- STOIL (invalid)  
- STOIL (invalid)  

Let’s try “STOIL” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next valid option: “STOIC” – but C is eliminated.  
Another valid word: “STOKE” – but E is eliminated.  
Another: “STOMP” – uses S, T, O, M, P. All letters are still possible.

“STOMP” is a valid word and uses five fresh, common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
None of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller pool of candidates.  
Common remaining high-frequency letters are:  
- S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q, N (but N is already out).

A good next guess should use fresh, common letters to narrow things down.  
Let’s pick a word that uses S, T, I, O, L, and avoids the eliminated letters.

Candidate words:  
- STOIL (not valid)  
- STOIC (valid)  
- STOIL (invalid)  
- STOIC is valid and uses S, T, O, I, C – but C is eliminated.  
- STOIL (invalid)  
- STOIL (invalid)  

Let’s try “STOIL” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next valid option: “STOIC” – but C is eliminated.  
Another valid word: “STOKE” – but E is eliminated.  
Another: “STOMP” – uses S, T, O, M, P. All letters are still possible.

“STOMP” is a valid word and uses five fresh, common letters.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word:
  – S is in the correct position (position 1).
  – O is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _   (S fixed in slot 1)
and the word contains O somewhere among slots 2, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: D, I, L, U, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains O not in position 3
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P)

Candidate words:
- SPOIL – uses P (eliminated) and I, L (but P is out)
- SLOTH – uses T (eliminated)
- SUGAR – uses U, G, A (A eliminated)
- SWORD – uses W, O, R, D (R eliminated)
- SLOSH – uses L, O, S, H – all still possible
- SLOSH: S ✓, O in position 2 (allowed), L, S, H – no conflicts
- SLOSH is valid.

Another check: S, L, O, S, H – letters are all allowed so far.
