For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words. Common choices include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in many words, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.
- The letters L, T, E are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and A.
2. Does not contain L, T, E.
3. Has S not in position 1 and A not in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding L, T, E).

A good next guess would be something that places S and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. Words like ""CRASH"" or ""RASPY"" are possibilities, but let's think of one that covers new common letters.

""CRASH"" includes:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 - but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this is invalid)
Oops, that puts A in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.

""RASPY"":
- R (new)
- A (known, now in position 2)
- S (known, now in position 3)
- P (new)
- Y (new)

This seems valid because:
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- S is in position 3 (not 1)
- Introduces R, P, Y
- Excludes L, T, E as required

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A – must be in position 2 (from RASPY feedback: A(✓))
- S – in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Y – in the word but not in position 5

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, R, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- A must be in 2 (already fixed)
- Y cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is taken by A)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _
with remaining letters to place: S, Y plus two more letters that are not L,T,E,R,P.

Available letters (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (with S and Y placed appropriately).

Let’s try to pick common remaining consonants and vowels: N, D, I, O, K, M, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- S must be in 4 or 5
- Y must be in 1, 3, or 4

Consider the word “M A S S Y” – but S repeats, which is unlikely.

Consider “D A N S Y”:
- D (new)
- A (fixed in 2)
- N (new)
- S (in position 4 – allowed)
- Y (in position 5 – NOT allowed, since Y cannot be in 5)

Next try “C A N S Y” – same issue with Y in 5.

Try “B A N S Y” – Y in 5 again.

Try “B A S I N” – but Y is missing, and we know Y must be present.

We must include Y somewhere. Let’s try placing Y in position 1:

Y A _ _ _
S must go in 4 or 5.

Try “Y A S D K” – but this seems obscure.

Try “B A Y S N” – B and N are new, Y in 3, S in 4.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 ✓
- S in 4 (allowed) ✓
- Y in 3 (allowed) ✓
- B and N are new letters not excluded ✓
- No L,T,E,R,P ✓

“BAYSN” is not a valid English word, though.

Try “C A Y S N” – “CAYS” is a word, but “CAYSN” isn’t.

Try “M A Y S N” – “MAYS” is a word, but “MAYS N” isn’t.

Try “D A Y S N” – “DAYS” is a word, but again not 5-letter unique.

Instead, let’s try placing S in position 5 and Y in position 1 or 3 or 4.

</think>

<guess>YACKS</guess>",YACKS,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A – must be in position 2 (from RASPY feedback: A(✓))
- S – in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Y – in the word but not in position 5

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, R, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- A must be in 2 (already fixed)
- Y cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is taken by A)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _
with remaining letters to place: S, Y plus two more letters that are not L,T,E,R,P.

Available letters (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (with S and Y placed appropriately).

Let’s try to pick common remaining consonants and vowels: N, D, I, O, K, M, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- S must be in 4 or 5
- Y must be in 1, 3, or 4

Consider the word “M A S S Y” – but S repeats, which is unlikely.

Consider “D A N S Y”:
- D (new)
- A (fixed in 2)
- N (new)
- S (in position 4 – allowed)
- Y (in position 5 – NOT allowed, since Y cannot be in 5)

Next try “C A N S Y” – same issue with Y in 5.

Try “B A N S Y” – Y in 5 again.

Try “B A S I N” – but Y is missing, and we know Y must be present.

We must include Y somewhere. Let’s try placing Y in position 1:

Y A _ _ _
S must go in 4 or 5.

Try “Y A S D K” – but this seems obscure.

Try “B A Y S N” – B and N are new, Y in 3, S in 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words. Common choices include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in many words, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.
- The letters L, T, E are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and A.
2. Does not contain L, T, E.
3. Has S not in position 1 and A not in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding L, T, E).

A good next guess would be something that places S and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. Words like ""CRASH"" or ""RASPY"" are possibilities, but let's think of one that covers new common letters.

""CRASH"" includes:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 - but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this is invalid)
Oops, that puts A in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.

""RASPY"":
- R (new)
- A (known, now in position 2)
- S (known, now in position 3)
- P (new)
- Y (new)

This seems valid because:
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- S is in position 3 (not 1)
- Introduces R, P, Y
- Excludes L, T, E as required

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A – must be in position 2 (from RASPY feedback: A(✓))
- S – in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Y – in the word but not in position 5

Letters that are NOT in the word:

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- A must be in 2 (already fixed)
- Y cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is taken by A)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (with S and Y placed appropriately).

- D (new)
- A (fixed in 2)
- N (new)
- S (in position 4 – allowed)
- Y (in position 5 – NOT allowed, since Y cannot be in 5)

Next try “C A N S Y” – same issue with Y in 5.

Try “B A N S Y” – Y in 5 again.

Try “B A S I N” – but Y is missing, and we know Y must be present.

We must include Y somewhere. Let’s try placing Y in position 1:

From the three rounds we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 3 respectively; L, T, E are out.

2. RASPY → R(x) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(-)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 2; S is in the word but not positions 1 or 3; Y is in the word but not position 5; R, P are out.

3. YACKS → Y(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) S(✓)  
   ⇒ Y is fixed in position 1; A is fixed in position 2; S is fixed in position 5; C, K are out.

So the word must be of the form:  
Y A _ _ S

Letters still allowed (excluding L, T, E, R, P, C, K):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Looking for common English 5-letter words matching Y A _ _ S:

- YACKS – invalid (K already excluded)  
- YAGGS – G allowed, but double G seems rare  
- YAHTS – T excluded  
- YAMBS – M, B allowed → “YAMBS” is a valid word  
- YANKS – N, K allowed but K excluded  
- YAOWS – O, W allowed → “YAOWS” is obscure  
- YAPHS – P excluded

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words. Common choices include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in many words, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.
- The letters L, T, E are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and A.
2. Does not contain L, T, E.
3. Has S not in position 1 and A not in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding L, T, E).

A good next guess would be something that places S and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. Words like ""CRASH"" or ""RASPY"" are possibilities, but let's think of one that covers new common letters.

""CRASH"" includes:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 - but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this is invalid)
Oops, that puts A in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.

""RASPY"":
- R (new)
- A (known, now in position 2)
- S (known, now in position 3)
- P (new)
- Y (new)

This seems valid because:
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- S is in position 3 (not 1)
- Introduces R, P, Y
- Excludes L, T, E as required

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A – must be in position 2 (from RASPY feedback: A(✓))
- S – in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Y – in the word but not in position 5

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, R, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- A must be in 2 (already fixed)
- Y cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is taken by A)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _
with remaining letters to place: S, Y plus two more letters that are not L,T,E,R,P.

Available letters (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (with S and Y placed appropriately).

Let’s try to pick common remaining consonants and vowels: N, D, I, O, K, M, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- S must be in 4 or 5
- Y must be in 1, 3, or 4

Consider the word “M A S S Y” – but S repeats, which is unlikely.

Consider “D A N S Y”:
- D (new)
- A (fixed in 2)
- N (new)
- S (in position 4 – allowed)
- Y (in position 5 – NOT allowed, since Y cannot be in 5)

Next try “C A N S Y” – same issue with Y in 5.

Try “B A N S Y” – Y in 5 again.

Try “B A S I N” – but Y is missing, and we know Y must be present.

We must include Y somewhere. Let’s try placing Y in position 1:

Y A _ _ _
S must go in 4 or 5.

Try “Y A S D K” – but this seems obscure.

Try “B A Y S N” – B and N are new, Y in 3, S in 4.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 ✓
- S in 4 (allowed) ✓
- Y in 3 (allowed) ✓
- B and N are new letters not excluded ✓
- No L,T,E,R,P ✓

“BAYSN” is not a valid English word, though.

Try “C A Y S N” – “CAYS” is a word, but “CAYSN” isn’t.

Try “M A Y S N” – “MAYS” is a word, but “MAYS N” isn’t.

Try “D A Y S N” – “DAYS” is a word, but again not 5-letter unique.

Instead, let’s try placing S in position 5 and Y in position 1 or 3 or 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words. Common choices include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in many words, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.
- The letters L, T, E are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and A.
2. Does not contain L, T, E.
3. Has S not in position 1 and A not in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding L, T, E).

A good next guess would be something that places S and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. Words like ""CRASH"" or ""RASPY"" are possibilities, but let's think of one that covers new common letters.

""CRASH"" includes:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 - but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this is invalid)
Oops, that puts A in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.

""RASPY"":
- R (new)
- A (known, now in position 2)
- S (known, now in position 3)
- P (new)
- Y (new)

This seems valid because:
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- S is in position 3 (not 1)
- Introduces R, P, Y
- Excludes L, T, E as required

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A – must be in position 2 (from RASPY feedback: A(✓))
- S – in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- Y – in the word but not in position 5

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, R, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- A must be in 2 (already fixed)
- Y cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is taken by A)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _
with remaining letters to place: S, Y plus two more letters that are not L,T,E,R,P.

Available letters (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (with S and Y placed appropriately).

Let’s try to pick common remaining consonants and vowels: N, D, I, O, K, M, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- S must be in 4 or 5
- Y must be in 1, 3, or 4

Consider the word “M A S S Y” – but S repeats, which is unlikely.

Consider “D A N S Y”:
- D (new)
- A (fixed in 2)
- N (new)
- S (in position 4 – allowed)
- Y (in position 5 – NOT allowed, since Y cannot be in 5)

Next try “C A N S Y” – same issue with Y in 5.

Try “B A N S Y” – Y in 5 again.

Try “B A S I N” – but Y is missing, and we know Y must be present.

We must include Y somewhere. Let’s try placing Y in position 1:

Y A _ _ _
S must go in 4 or 5.

Try “Y A S D K” – but this seems obscure.

Try “B A Y S N” – B and N are new, Y in 3, S in 4.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 ✓
- S in 4 (allowed) ✓
- Y in 3 (allowed) ✓
- B and N are new letters not excluded ✓
- No L,T,E,R,P ✓

“BAYSN” is not a valid English word, though.

Try “C A Y S N” – “CAYS” is a word, but “CAYSN” isn’t.

Try “M A Y S N” – “MAYS” is a word, but “MAYS N” isn’t.

Try “D A Y S N” – “DAYS” is a word, but again not 5-letter unique.

Try “Y A _ _ S” with Y in 1 and S in 5:

Need valid 5-letter word starting with Y and ending with S, with A in 2 and no L,T,E,R,P.

Possible: Y A _ _ S

Try “Y A C K S” – “YACKS” is valid.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 ✓
- S in 5 (allowed) ✓
- Y in 1 (allowed) ✓
- C, K are new letters not excluded ✓
- No L,T,E,R,P ✓

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: YACKS -> FEEDBACK: Y(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 3 respectively; L, T, E are out.

2. RASPY → R(x) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(-)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 2; S is in the word but not positions 1 or 3; Y is in the word but not position 5; R, P are out.

3. YACKS → Y(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) S(✓)  
   ⇒ Y is fixed in position 1; A is fixed in position 2; S is fixed in position 5; C, K are out.

So the word must be of the form:  
Y A _ _ S

Letters still allowed (excluding L, T, E, R, P, C, K):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more distinct letters from that set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Looking for common English 5-letter words matching Y A _ _ S:

- YACKS – invalid (K already excluded)  
- YAGGS – G allowed, but double G seems rare  
- YAHTS – T excluded  
- YAMBS – M, B allowed → “YAMBS” is a valid word  
- YANKS – N, K allowed but K excluded  
- YAOWS – O, W allowed → “YAOWS” is obscure  
- YAPHS – P excluded  
- YARNS – R excluded  
- YAZZY – Z allowed but double Z and J allowed, word exists but uncommon  

Among these, “YAMBS” is the most common and fits all constraints:
- Y in 1 ✓  
- A in 2 ✓  
- M, B new and allowed ✓  
- S in 5 ✓  

Hence, the next logical guess is YAMBS.

Current constraints after four guesses:

1. Word must be Y A _ _ S (positions 1, 2, 5 fixed).
2. Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, R, P, C, K, M, B.
3. Remaining letters that can appear in positions 3 and 4:  
   D, F, G, H, I, J, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form Y A _ _ S using only these letters for the two blanks.

Common words that fit:
- YARDS – R excluded  
- YAKKS – K excluded  
- YAHTS – T excluded  
- YAMBS – already tried (M, B excluded)  
- YAPPS – P excluded  
- YARNS – R excluded  
- YAZZY – Z allowed, but double Z and J allowed, word exists but uncommon  

Looking at the remaining letters, the most promising common word is:

Y A D _ S → YADIS (obscure)  
Y A D S _ → invalid (S already used)  
Y A N _ S → YANGS (valid, uses N, G)  

Check YANGS:
- Y(✓) A(✓) N(_) G(_) S(✓)  
- N and G are both still allowed.  
- “YANGS” is a recognized 5-letter English word.

No other common word seems to fit, so we’ll try YANGS.

We now know the word is Y A _ _ S and the only two letters still allowed for the blanks are from the set  
{D, F, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}.  

Common 5-letter English words of the form Y A _ _ S with those letters:

- Y A D _ S → YADIS (obscure, plural of “yad” — not standard)  
- Y A F _ S → YAFIS (non-word)  
- Y A H _ S → YAHS (non-word)  
- Y A I _ S → YAITS (non-word)  
- Y A J _ S → YAJES (non-word)  
- Y A O _ S → YAOLS (non-word)  
- Y A Q _ S → YAQS (non-word)  
- Y A U _ S → YAUS (non-word)  
- Y A V _ S → YAVS (non-word)  
- Y A W _ S → YAWS (valid, plural of “yawn”)  
- Y A X _ S → YAXS (non-word)  
- Y A Z _ S → YAZS (non-word)  

The only remaining common word is YAWS, but it is the plural of “yawn” and is quite informal. Despite its rarity, it is the only valid candidate left that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the final guess is YAWS.
