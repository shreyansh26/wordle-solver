For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This maximizes the chance of hitting at least some correct letters or eliminating many common letters early on. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are among the most common letters in English words.
- S is very common as both a consonant and a vowel.
- R and O are also high-frequency letters.
- Using no repeated letters gives maximum coverage.

This should provide good feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is R _ _ _ _.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O appears somewhere else (not in position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else (not in position 4).

So far we know:
- First letter: R
- O and S are somewhere in positions 2-5, but not where they were in AROSE.
- A and E are excluded.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Place O and S in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible word structures: R _ _ _ _ with O and S in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try a word that moves O and S and adds new common letters: R O S _ _ → but that repeats the S position issue. Instead, let’s try R _ O _ S or R _ S _ O.

A word like ""ROUST"" comes to mind:
- R (✓) stays in position 1.
- O moves to position 2 (was position 3).
- U is a new common vowel.
- S moves to position 4 (was position 4 – oops, same position, bad). Let’s avoid that.

Better: ""ROUST"" has S in position 4 again – same as before, not helpful.

Let’s try ""ROBIN"":
- R (✓) position 1.
- O position 2 (was 3).
- B, I, N are new letters.
- S is not used, but we know S is in the word somewhere. Maybe better to include S.

""ROINS"" – but that’s not a valid word.

""RISON"" – valid? Not sure.

""ROUST"" was invalid due to S position.

""ROUND"" – no S.

""ROUST"" was invalid.

""ROUST"" is valid, but S is same position.

Alternative: ""SOUR"" – too short.

""STORM"" – has S in position 1, but R is fixed at 1.

""STORY"" – S at 1, R at 2 (but R must be at 1).

""TORUS"" – R at 2, invalid.

""ROUST"" seems best but S position is same.

Wait, let’s try ""ROUST"" anyway, as it’s the closest valid word with O and S moved, even if S is same position – but that’s not helpful.

Better: ""RISON"" – R, I, S, O, N. Let’s check:
- R at 1 (✓).
- I new.
- S at 3 (was 4, now new).
- O at 4 (was 3, now new).
- N new.

""RISON"" is a valid word meaning a group of people or a feud.

This seems optimal: keeps R, tests S at 3, O at 4, and introduces I and N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (conflicting with Guess 1).  
  Wait – this must mean the feedback for RISON was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading: RISON feedback is R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x).  
  The first letter R(-) means “R is in the word but in the wrong position.”  
  But Guess 1 already told us R(✓) – i.e., R is in the correct position (position 1).  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback for RISON is relative to RISON’s positions, not absolute positions.  
  Let me re-analyze:

Absolute positions:
- Position 1: R (✓ from AROSE) → word must start with R.
- Position 3 in AROSE: O was marked (-) → O is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4 in AROSE: S was marked (-) → S is in the word but not at position 4.
- Position 1 in RISON: R was marked (-) → but we know position 1 must be R, so this is consistent (R is correct at 1, so (-) here would actually be impossible; this suggests the feedback is position-relative).

Actually, the feedback symbols are always relative to the guess, not absolute positions. So:

From AROSE:
- A(x) – A not in word.
- R(✓) – R is correct at position 1.
- O(-) – O is in word but not at position 3.
- S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- E(x) – E not in word.

From RISON:
- R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But we know from AROSE that R is at position 1.  
  This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
  Re-reading the original feedback carefully:

Original feedback provided:
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: RISON -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Ah! The feedback for Guess 1 has O(✓) – meaning O is correct at position 3.  
But the feedback for Guess 2 has O(-) – meaning O is in the word but not at position 4 (since in RISON, O is at position 4).  
This is consistent with O being at position 3 (from Guess 1), because then in RISON (where O is at 4), it would be (-).

Similarly, S(-) from RISON means S is in word but not at position 3 (since in RISON, S is at 3).  
From Guess 1, S(-) means S is not at position 4.  
So S must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, from RISON:
- R(-) means R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But from Guess 1, R is at position 1.  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback was meant to be relative to the guess positions.

Wait, let’s re-interpret strictly per guess:

Guess 1 positions:
1:A 2:R 3:O 4:S 5:E
Feedback: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2 positions:
1:R 2:I 3:S 4:O 5:N
Feedback: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Now the feedback is clear per-guess.

From Guess 1:
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2?  
  Wait, no: in AROSE, position 2 is R, and feedback for that position is R(✓).  
  So R is correct at position 2, not 1.  
  I misread earlier – the ✓ applies to the letter in that specific position in the guess.

This changes everything. Let me re-summarize:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O is correct at position 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) – E not in word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:
_ R O _ _

Letters in word: R, O, S (since S is in word but not at 4).
Letters not in word: A, E.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- Position 1: R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  We already know R is at position 2, so this is consistent.
- Position 2: I(x) – I not in word.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 3.  
  From Guess 1, S is not at position 4.  
  So S must be at position 5 (only remaining spot).
- Position 4: O(-) – O is in word but not at position 4.  
  We already know O is at position 3, so this is consistent.
- Position 5: N(x) – N not in word.

So far:
- Pattern: _ R O _ S
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E, I, N
- Missing letters must come from remaining alphabet excluding A, E, I, N.

Possible remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But position 4 is currently empty (since pattern is _ R O _ S), and we have no info yet on what’s there.  
We also have no info on position 1.

We need a word that:
- Has R at 2, O at 3, S at 5.
- Has no A, E, I, N.
- Has valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching _ R O _ S:

Possible candidates:
- BOROS – but has O twice, and we don’t know if O repeats.
- CORAL – but A is excluded.
- DROSS – has S twice, but S is already known.
- FROST – T is allowed, but F, R, O, S, T – all allowed so far.
- GROTS – G, R, O, T, S – all allowed.
- PROSO – has O twice.
- TROTS – T, R, O, T, S – has T twice, but T is allowed.

""FROST"" seems like a strong candidate:
- F, R, O, S, T – all allowed (none of A, E, I, N).
- Matches _ R O _ S pattern.

Let’s check if ""FROST"" is valid and fits all constraints:
- F: new letter, not tested yet.
- R: at position 2 (✓ from Guess 1).
- O: at position 3 (✓ from Guess 1).
- S: at position 5 (must be, since it can’t be 3 or 4).
- T: new letter, not tested yet.

This should give us maximum information.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed at position 2.
- O is confirmed at position 3.
- S must be at position 5 (since it can't be at 3 or 4).
- The word has no A, E, I, or N.
- We need valid letters for positions 1 and 4.

A strong next guess is ""FROST"", which fits _ R O _ S and introduces new letters F and T.

<guess>FROST</guess>",FROST,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (conflicting with Guess 1).  
  Wait – this must mean the feedback for RISON was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading: RISON feedback is R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x).  
  The first letter R(-) means “R is in the word but in the wrong position.”  
  But Guess 1 already told us R(✓) – i.e., R is in the correct position (position 1).  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback for RISON is relative to RISON’s positions, not absolute positions.  
  Let me re-analyze:

Absolute positions:
- Position 1: R (✓ from AROSE) → word must start with R.
- Position 3 in AROSE: O was marked (-) → O is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4 in AROSE: S was marked (-) → S is in the word but not at position 4.
- Position 1 in RISON: R was marked (-) → but we know position 1 must be R, so this is consistent (R is correct at 1, so (-) here would actually be impossible; this suggests the feedback is position-relative).

Actually, the feedback symbols are always relative to the guess, not absolute positions. So:

From AROSE:
- A(x) – A not in word.
- R(✓) – R is correct at position 1.
- O(-) – O is in word but not at position 3.
- S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- E(x) – E not in word.

From RISON:
- R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But we know from AROSE that R is at position 1.  
  This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
  Re-reading the original feedback carefully:

Original feedback provided:
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: RISON -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Ah! The feedback for Guess 1 has O(✓) – meaning O is correct at position 3.  
But the feedback for Guess 2 has O(-) – meaning O is in the word but not at position 4 (since in RISON, O is at position 4).  
This is consistent with O being at position 3 (from Guess 1), because then in RISON (where O is at 4), it would be (-).

Similarly, S(-) from RISON means S is in word but not at position 3 (since in RISON, S is at 3).  
From Guess 1, S(-) means S is not at position 4.  
So S must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, from RISON:
- R(-) means R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But from Guess 1, R is at position 1.  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback was meant to be relative to the guess positions.

Wait, let’s re-interpret strictly per guess:

Guess 1 positions:
1:A 2:R 3:O 4:S 5:E
Feedback: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2 positions:
1:R 2:I 3:S 4:O 5:N
Feedback: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Now the feedback is clear per-guess.

From Guess 1:
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2?  
  Wait, no: in AROSE, position 2 is R, and feedback for that position is R(✓).  
  So R is correct at position 2, not 1.  
  I misread earlier – the ✓ applies to the letter in that specific position in the guess.

This changes everything. Let me re-summarize:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O is correct at position 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) – E not in word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:

Letters not in word: A, E.

- Position 2: I(x) – I not in word.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 3.  
  From Guess 1, S is not at position 4.  
  So S must be at position 5 (only remaining spot).
- Position 4: O(-) – O is in word but not at position 4.  
  We already know O is at position 3, so this is consistent.
- Position 5: N(x) – N not in word.

So far:
- Pattern: _ R O _ S
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E, I, N
- Missing letters must come from remaining alphabet excluding A, E, I, N.

Possible remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But position 4 is currently empty (since pattern is _ R O _ S), and we have no info yet on what’s there.  
We also have no info on position 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This maximizes the chance of hitting at least some correct letters or eliminating many common letters early on. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are among the most common letters in English words.
- S is very common as both a consonant and a vowel.
- R and O are also high-frequency letters.
- Using no repeated letters gives maximum coverage.

This should provide good feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is R _ _ _ _.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O appears somewhere else (not in position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else (not in position 4).

So far we know:
- First letter: R
- O and S are somewhere in positions 2-5, but not where they were in AROSE.
- A and E are excluded.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Place O and S in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible word structures: R _ _ _ _ with O and S in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try a word that moves O and S and adds new common letters: R O S _ _ → but that repeats the S position issue. Instead, let’s try R _ O _ S or R _ S _ O.

A word like ""ROUST"" comes to mind:
- R (✓) stays in position 1.
- O moves to position 2 (was position 3).
- U is a new common vowel.
- S moves to position 4 (was position 4 – oops, same position, bad). Let’s avoid that.

Better: ""ROUST"" has S in position 4 again – same as before, not helpful.

Let’s try ""ROBIN"":
- R (✓) position 1.
- O position 2 (was 3).
- B, I, N are new letters.
- S is not used, but we know S is in the word somewhere. Maybe better to include S.

""ROINS"" – but that’s not a valid word.

""RISON"" – valid? Not sure.

""ROUST"" was invalid due to S position.

""ROUND"" – no S.

""ROUST"" was invalid.

""ROUST"" is valid, but S is same position.

Alternative: ""SOUR"" – too short.

""STORM"" – has S in position 1, but R is fixed at 1.

""STORY"" – S at 1, R at 2 (but R must be at 1).

""TORUS"" – R at 2, invalid.

""ROUST"" seems best but S position is same.

Wait, let’s try ""ROUST"" anyway, as it’s the closest valid word with O and S moved, even if S is same position – but that’s not helpful.

Better: ""RISON"" – R, I, S, O, N. Let’s check:
- R at 1 (✓).
- I new.
- S at 3 (was 4, now new).
- O at 4 (was 3, now new).
- N new.

""RISON"" is a valid word meaning a group of people or a feud.

This seems optimal: keeps R, tests S at 3, O at 4, and introduces I and N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This maximizes the chance of hitting at least some correct letters or eliminating many common letters early on. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are among the most common letters in English words.
- S is very common as both a consonant and a vowel.
- R and O are also high-frequency letters.
- Using no repeated letters gives maximum coverage.

This should provide good feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is R _ _ _ _.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O appears somewhere else (not in position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else (not in position 4).

So far we know:
- First letter: R
- O and S are somewhere in positions 2-5, but not where they were in AROSE.
- A and E are excluded.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Place O and S in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible word structures: R _ _ _ _ with O and S in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try a word that moves O and S and adds new common letters: R O S _ _ → but that repeats the S position issue. Instead, let’s try R _ O _ S or R _ S _ O.

A word like ""ROUST"" comes to mind:
- R (✓) stays in position 1.
- O moves to position 2 (was position 3).
- U is a new common vowel.
- S moves to position 4 (was position 4 – oops, same position, bad). Let’s avoid that.

Better: ""ROUST"" has S in position 4 again – same as before, not helpful.

Let’s try ""ROBIN"":
- R (✓) position 1.
- O position 2 (was 3).
- B, I, N are new letters.
- S is not used, but we know S is in the word somewhere. Maybe better to include S.

""ROINS"" – but that’s not a valid word.

""RISON"" – valid? Not sure.

""ROUST"" was invalid due to S position.

""ROUND"" – no S.

""ROUST"" was invalid.

""ROUST"" is valid, but S is same position.

Alternative: ""SOUR"" – too short.

""STORM"" – has S in position 1, but R is fixed at 1.

""STORY"" – S at 1, R at 2 (but R must be at 1).

""TORUS"" – R at 2, invalid.

""ROUST"" seems best but S position is same.

Wait, let’s try ""ROUST"" anyway, as it’s the closest valid word with O and S moved, even if S is same position – but that’s not helpful.

Better: ""RISON"" – R, I, S, O, N. Let’s check:
- R at 1 (✓).
- I new.
- S at 3 (was 4, now new).
- O at 4 (was 3, now new).
- N new.

""RISON"" is a valid word meaning a group of people or a feud.

This seems optimal: keeps R, tests S at 3, O at 4, and introduces I and N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (conflicting with Guess 1).  
  Wait – this must mean the feedback for RISON was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading: RISON feedback is R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x).  
  The first letter R(-) means “R is in the word but in the wrong position.”  
  But Guess 1 already told us R(✓) – i.e., R is in the correct position (position 1).  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback for RISON is relative to RISON’s positions, not absolute positions.  
  Let me re-analyze:

Absolute positions:
- Position 1: R (✓ from AROSE) → word must start with R.
- Position 3 in AROSE: O was marked (-) → O is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4 in AROSE: S was marked (-) → S is in the word but not at position 4.
- Position 1 in RISON: R was marked (-) → but we know position 1 must be R, so this is consistent (R is correct at 1, so (-) here would actually be impossible; this suggests the feedback is position-relative).

Actually, the feedback symbols are always relative to the guess, not absolute positions. So:

From AROSE:
- A(x) – A not in word.
- R(✓) – R is correct at position 1.
- O(-) – O is in word but not at position 3.
- S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- E(x) – E not in word.

From RISON:
- R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But we know from AROSE that R is at position 1.  
  This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
  Re-reading the original feedback carefully:

Original feedback provided:
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: RISON -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Ah! The feedback for Guess 1 has O(✓) – meaning O is correct at position 3.  
But the feedback for Guess 2 has O(-) – meaning O is in the word but not at position 4 (since in RISON, O is at position 4).  
This is consistent with O being at position 3 (from Guess 1), because then in RISON (where O is at 4), it would be (-).

Similarly, S(-) from RISON means S is in word but not at position 3 (since in RISON, S is at 3).  
From Guess 1, S(-) means S is not at position 4.  
So S must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, from RISON:
- R(-) means R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But from Guess 1, R is at position 1.  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback was meant to be relative to the guess positions.

Wait, let’s re-interpret strictly per guess:

Guess 1 positions:
1:A 2:R 3:O 4:S 5:E
Feedback: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2 positions:
1:R 2:I 3:S 4:O 5:N
Feedback: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Now the feedback is clear per-guess.

From Guess 1:
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2?  
  Wait, no: in AROSE, position 2 is R, and feedback for that position is R(✓).  
  So R is correct at position 2, not 1.  
  I misread earlier – the ✓ applies to the letter in that specific position in the guess.

This changes everything. Let me re-summarize:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O is correct at position 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) – E not in word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:
_ R O _ _

Letters in word: R, O, S (since S is in word but not at 4).
Letters not in word: A, E.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- Position 1: R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  We already know R is at position 2, so this is consistent.
- Position 2: I(x) – I not in word.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 3.  
  From Guess 1, S is not at position 4.  
  So S must be at position 5 (only remaining spot).
- Position 4: O(-) – O is in word but not at position 4.  
  We already know O is at position 3, so this is consistent.
- Position 5: N(x) – N not in word.

So far:
- Pattern: _ R O _ S
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E, I, N
- Missing letters must come from remaining alphabet excluding A, E, I, N.

Possible remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But position 4 is currently empty (since pattern is _ R O _ S), and we have no info yet on what’s there.  
We also have no info on position 1.

We need a word that:
- Has R at 2, O at 3, S at 5.
- Has no A, E, I, N.
- Has valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching _ R O _ S:

Possible candidates:
- BOROS – but has O twice, and we don’t know if O repeats.
- CORAL – but A is excluded.
- DROSS – has S twice, but S is already known.
- FROST – T is allowed, but F, R, O, S, T – all allowed so far.
- GROTS – G, R, O, T, S – all allowed.
- PROSO – has O twice.
- TROTS – T, R, O, T, S – has T twice, but T is allowed.

""FROST"" seems like a strong candidate:
- F, R, O, S, T – all allowed (none of A, E, I, N).
- Matches _ R O _ S pattern.

Let’s check if ""FROST"" is valid and fits all constraints:
- F: new letter, not tested yet.
- R: at position 2 (✓ from Guess 1).
- O: at position 3 (✓ from Guess 1).
- S: at position 5 (must be, since it can’t be 3 or 4).
- T: new letter, not tested yet.

This should give us maximum information.Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed at position 2.
- O is confirmed at position 3.
- S must be at position 5 (since it can't be at 3 or 4).
- The word has no A, E, I, or N.
- We need valid letters for positions 1 and 4.

A strong next guess is ""FROST"", which fits _ R O _ S and introduces new letters F and T.

From Guess 3 (FROST):
- Position 1: F(x) – F not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R confirmed at 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O confirmed at 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at 4.  
  (Again confirms S must be at 5.)
- Position 5: T(-) – T is in word but not at 5.  
  (So T must be at position 1 or 4.)

Current pattern: _ R O _ S

Letters in word: R, O, S, T  
Letters not in word: A, E, I, N, F

T must be at position 1 or 4.  
- If T is at 1: T R O _ S → but then position 4 must be filled, and T is already used.  
  Possible word: T R O _ S. The only common word is “TROPS” but P is allowed.  
- If T is at 4: _ R O T S → position 1 must be filled. Possible word: “GROTS” but G is allowed.

Between “TROPS” and “GROTS”, “GROTS” is more common and uses G (new letter).

Check constraints:
- G, R, O, T, S – none of A, E, I, N, F.
- Pattern _ R O T S.

Thus, next guess: GROTS

1. Position constraints:

   - Position 5: S (✓) – fixed.
   - Position 4: T (-) – T is in the word but not at position 4.
   - Position 1: G (x) – G is not in the word.

2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - R, O, S, T (from T being “in word but not at 4” and S being “in word but not at 4” in earlier guesses).

3. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   A, E, I, N, F, G.

4. Pattern so far:

5. T must be placed:
   - Cannot be at position 4 (from GROTS feedback).
   - Cannot be at positions 2, 3, 5 (already occupied by R, O, S).
   - Therefore T must be at position 1.

Thus the word is forced to be: T R O _ S

Only position 4 remains to be determined.  
We know:
- Letters already used / confirmed: R, O, S, T

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This maximizes the chance of hitting at least some correct letters or eliminating many common letters early on. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are among the most common letters in English words.
- S is very common as both a consonant and a vowel.
- R and O are also high-frequency letters.
- Using no repeated letters gives maximum coverage.

This should provide good feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is R _ _ _ _.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O appears somewhere else (not in position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else (not in position 4).

So far we know:
- First letter: R
- O and S are somewhere in positions 2-5, but not where they were in AROSE.
- A and E are excluded.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Place O and S in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible word structures: R _ _ _ _ with O and S in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try a word that moves O and S and adds new common letters: R O S _ _ → but that repeats the S position issue. Instead, let’s try R _ O _ S or R _ S _ O.

A word like ""ROUST"" comes to mind:
- R (✓) stays in position 1.
- O moves to position 2 (was position 3).
- U is a new common vowel.
- S moves to position 4 (was position 4 – oops, same position, bad). Let’s avoid that.

Better: ""ROUST"" has S in position 4 again – same as before, not helpful.

Let’s try ""ROBIN"":
- R (✓) position 1.
- O position 2 (was 3).
- B, I, N are new letters.
- S is not used, but we know S is in the word somewhere. Maybe better to include S.

""ROINS"" – but that’s not a valid word.

""RISON"" – valid? Not sure.

""ROUST"" was invalid due to S position.

""ROUND"" – no S.

""ROUST"" was invalid.

""ROUST"" is valid, but S is same position.

Alternative: ""SOUR"" – too short.

""STORM"" – has S in position 1, but R is fixed at 1.

""STORY"" – S at 1, R at 2 (but R must be at 1).

""TORUS"" – R at 2, invalid.

""ROUST"" seems best but S position is same.

Wait, let’s try ""ROUST"" anyway, as it’s the closest valid word with O and S moved, even if S is same position – but that’s not helpful.

Better: ""RISON"" – R, I, S, O, N. Let’s check:
- R at 1 (✓).
- I new.
- S at 3 (was 4, now new).
- O at 4 (was 3, now new).
- N new.

""RISON"" is a valid word meaning a group of people or a feud.

This seems optimal: keeps R, tests S at 3, O at 4, and introduces I and N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (conflicting with Guess 1).  
  Wait – this must mean the feedback for RISON was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading: RISON feedback is R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x).  
  The first letter R(-) means “R is in the word but in the wrong position.”  
  But Guess 1 already told us R(✓) – i.e., R is in the correct position (position 1).  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback for RISON is relative to RISON’s positions, not absolute positions.  
  Let me re-analyze:

Absolute positions:
- Position 1: R (✓ from AROSE) → word must start with R.
- Position 3 in AROSE: O was marked (-) → O is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4 in AROSE: S was marked (-) → S is in the word but not at position 4.
- Position 1 in RISON: R was marked (-) → but we know position 1 must be R, so this is consistent (R is correct at 1, so (-) here would actually be impossible; this suggests the feedback is position-relative).

Actually, the feedback symbols are always relative to the guess, not absolute positions. So:

From AROSE:
- A(x) – A not in word.
- R(✓) – R is correct at position 1.
- O(-) – O is in word but not at position 3.
- S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- E(x) – E not in word.

From RISON:
- R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But we know from AROSE that R is at position 1.  
  This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
  Re-reading the original feedback carefully:

Original feedback provided:
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: RISON -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Ah! The feedback for Guess 1 has O(✓) – meaning O is correct at position 3.  
But the feedback for Guess 2 has O(-) – meaning O is in the word but not at position 4 (since in RISON, O is at position 4).  
This is consistent with O being at position 3 (from Guess 1), because then in RISON (where O is at 4), it would be (-).

Similarly, S(-) from RISON means S is in word but not at position 3 (since in RISON, S is at 3).  
From Guess 1, S(-) means S is not at position 4.  
So S must be at position 2 or 5.

Also, from RISON:
- R(-) means R is in word but not at position 1.  
  But from Guess 1, R is at position 1.  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback was meant to be relative to the guess positions.

Wait, let’s re-interpret strictly per guess:

Guess 1 positions:
1:A 2:R 3:O 4:S 5:E
Feedback: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2 positions:
1:R 2:I 3:S 4:O 5:N
Feedback: R(-) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)

Now the feedback is clear per-guess.

From Guess 1:
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2?  
  Wait, no: in AROSE, position 2 is R, and feedback for that position is R(✓).  
  So R is correct at position 2, not 1.  
  I misread earlier – the ✓ applies to the letter in that specific position in the guess.

This changes everything. Let me re-summarize:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O is correct at position 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) – E not in word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:
_ R O _ _

Letters in word: R, O, S (since S is in word but not at 4).
Letters not in word: A, E.

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- Position 1: R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  We already know R is at position 2, so this is consistent.
- Position 2: I(x) – I not in word.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 3.  
  From Guess 1, S is not at position 4.  
  So S must be at position 5 (only remaining spot).
- Position 4: O(-) – O is in word but not at position 4.  
  We already know O is at position 3, so this is consistent.
- Position 5: N(x) – N not in word.

So far:
- Pattern: _ R O _ S
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E, I, N
- Missing letters must come from remaining alphabet excluding A, E, I, N.

Possible remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But position 4 is currently empty (since pattern is _ R O _ S), and we have no info yet on what’s there.  
We also have no info on position 1.

We need a word that:
- Has R at 2, O at 3, S at 5.
- Has no A, E, I, N.
- Has valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching _ R O _ S:

Possible candidates:
- BOROS – but has O twice, and we don’t know if O repeats.
- CORAL – but A is excluded.
- DROSS – has S twice, but S is already known.
- FROST – T is allowed, but F, R, O, S, T – all allowed so far.
- GROTS – G, R, O, T, S – all allowed.
- PROSO – has O twice.
- TROTS – T, R, O, T, S – has T twice, but T is allowed.

""FROST"" seems like a strong candidate:
- F, R, O, S, T – all allowed (none of A, E, I, N).
- Matches _ R O _ S pattern.

Let’s check if ""FROST"" is valid and fits all constraints:
- F: new letter, not tested yet.
- R: at position 2 (✓ from Guess 1).
- O: at position 3 (✓ from Guess 1).
- S: at position 5 (must be, since it can’t be 3 or 4).
- T: new letter, not tested yet.

This should give us maximum information.Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed at position 2.
- O is confirmed at position 3.
- S must be at position 5 (since it can't be at 3 or 4).
- The word has no A, E, I, or N.
- We need valid letters for positions 1 and 4.

A strong next guess is ""FROST"", which fits _ R O _ S and introduces new letters F and T.

Let’s re-express all feedback in absolute terms, using the known correct positions.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- Position 1: A(x) – A not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R is correct at position 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O is correct at position 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) – E not in word.

So the word looks like: _ R O _ _

Letters in word: R, O, S  
Letters not in word: A, E

From Guess 2 (RISON):
- Position 1: R(-) – R is in word but not at position 1.  
  (Consistent: R is at 2.)
- Position 2: I(x) – I not in word.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in word but not at position 3.  
  (So S cannot be at 3 or 4; must be at 5.)
- Position 4: O(-) – O is in word but not at position 4.  
  (Consistent: O is at 3.)
- Position 5: N(x) – N not in word.

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ S

Letters not in word: A, E, I, N

From Guess 3 (FROST):
- Position 1: F(x) – F not in word.
- Position 2: R(✓) – R confirmed at 2.
- Position 3: O(✓) – O confirmed at 3.
- Position 4: S(-) – S is in word but not at 4.  
  (Again confirms S must be at 5.)
- Position 5: T(-) – T is in word but not at 5.  
  (So T must be at position 1 or 4.)

Current pattern: _ R O _ S

Letters in word: R, O, S, T  
Letters not in word: A, E, I, N, F

T must be at position 1 or 4.  
- If T is at 1: T R O _ S → but then position 4 must be filled, and T is already used.  
  Possible word: T R O _ S. The only common word is “TROPS” but P is allowed.  
- If T is at 4: _ R O T S → position 1 must be filled. Possible word: “GROTS” but G is allowed.

Between “TROPS” and “GROTS”, “GROTS” is more common and uses G (new letter).

Check constraints:
- G, R, O, T, S – none of A, E, I, N, F.
- Pattern _ R O T S.

Thus, next guess: GROTS

Let’s extract the absolute constraints from all feedback so far.

1. Position constraints:
   - Position 2: R (✓) – fixed.
   - Position 3: O (✓) – fixed.
   - Position 5: S (✓) – fixed.
   - Position 4: T (-) – T is in the word but not at position 4.
   - Position 1: G (x) – G is not in the word.

2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - R, O, S, T (from T being “in word but not at 4” and S being “in word but not at 4” in earlier guesses).

3. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   A, E, I, N, F, G.

4. Pattern so far:
   _ R O _ S

5. T must be placed:
   - Cannot be at position 4 (from GROTS feedback).
   - Cannot be at positions 2, 3, 5 (already occupied by R, O, S).
   - Therefore T must be at position 1.

Thus the word is forced to be: T R O _ S

Only position 4 remains to be determined.  
We know:
- Letters already used / confirmed: R, O, S, T  
- Letters excluded: A, E, I, N, F, G  
- Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, C, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common 5-letter words matching TRO_S:
- TROPS – P is allowed.
- TRODS – D is allowed.
- TROCS – C is allowed.
- TROBS – B is allowed.

Among these, “TROPS” is the most common English word.

From the latest feedback on TROPS:
- T(✓) – T is correct at position 1.
- R(✓) – R is correct at position 2.
- O(✓) – O is correct at position 3.
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – S is correct at position 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined:
T R O _ S

We know:
- Position 4 must be a letter that has NOT been excluded.
- Excluded letters so far: A, E, I, N, F, G, P.
- Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, C, D, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit TRO_S:
- TROBS – B is allowed.
- TRODS – D is allowed.
- TROCS – C is allowed.
- TROMS – M is allowed.
- TROKS – K is allowed.

Among these, “TRODS” is the most common word.
