### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in AROSE—A, R, O, S, E—are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid those letters entirely.

- uses none of A, R, O, S, E

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the word.
2. UNTIL →  
   - U is in the word but in the **wrong** position (it is not in position 1).  
   - I is in the word **and** in the **correct** position (position 4).  
   - N, T, L are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ I _  
- It contains the letter U somewhere, but **not** in the first position.  
- It does **not** contain: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (already confirmed present), and Y (sometimes used as a vowel).

Since we need a 5-letter word with I in position 4 and U somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5), let’s brainstorm possibilities:

- C H U I K → CHUIK (not a valid word)  
- C U I K Y → (invalid length)  
- M U I C H → (I must be in position 4)  
- C H U I D → CHUID (not valid)  
- M U I D Y → (invalid)  
- C U I D Y → (invalid)  
- F U I C H → (invalid)  
- P U I C H → (invalid)  
- C U I P Y → (invalid)  
- C H U I K → (invalid)  

A valid word that fits: **CHUID** is not valid.  
Another valid word: **MUCKY** – but I is not in position 4.  
Another: **PUCKY** – same issue.  

Wait: we need I in position 4.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words with I in position 4 and no forbidden letters:

- C H U I K → invalid  
- C H U I D → invalid  
- M U I C H → invalid  
- F U I C H → invalid  
- P U I C H → invalid  
- C U I D Y → invalid  
- C H U I K → invalid  

Actually, let’s think differently:  
We have pattern _ _ _ I _ with U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible valid words:
- **D U I K Y** – but K and Y are uncommon.  
- **C H U I K** – invalid.  
- **M U I C H** – invalid.  
- **F U I C H** – invalid.  
- **P U I C H** – invalid.  
- **C U I D Y** – invalid.  

Wait, let me check a dictionary for valid 5-letter words with I in position 4 and containing U but not in position 1, and avoiding A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L.

A valid word is **CHUID**? No.  
Another: **MUCKY** – but I is not in position 4.  

Actually, let me think of **FUDGY** – but I is not in position 4.  

Wait, let me systematically build:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
We know: _ _ _ I _  
And U must appear in 2, 3, or 5.  
Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- Position 2 = U: _ U _ I _  
  - C U _ I _ → C U B I D, C U D I K, C U M I D, C U P I D, C U H I D, etc.  
  Valid words:  
  - C U D I K – invalid  
  - C U M I D – invalid  
  - C U P I D – valid (CUPID)  
  - C U H I D – invalid

  - P U C I D – valid (PUCID)  
  - F U C I D – valid (FUCID)  
  - H U C I D – invalid  
  - K U C I D – invalid  

- Position 3 = U: _ _ U I _

  - D U U I K – invalid  
  - C D U I K – invalid

  - C H U I K – invalid

  - C P D I U – invalid  
  - M C D I U – invalid

  - H C D I U – invalid  
  - C H M I U – invalid  
  - C H P I U – invalid  
  - C H G I U – invalid  
  - C H K I U – invalid  

The most promising valid word from above is **CUPID** (C U P I D).  
It fits:
- I is in position 4 (✓)  
- U is in position 2 (not position 1, so allowed)  
- Letters used: C, U, P, I, D – none of which are forbidden (A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L are excluded).  

Therefore, **CUPID** is a strong next guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

A balanced choice that covers several fresh high-frequency letters is “UNTIL”:
- U, N, T, I, L – none of which were in AROSE.
- It tests two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).

So I’ll go with “UNTIL”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the word.
2. UNTIL →  
   - U is in the word but in the **wrong** position (it is not in position 1).  
   - I is in the word **and** in the **correct** position (position 4).  
   - N, T, L are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ I _  
- It contains the letter U somewhere, but **not** in the first position.  
- It does **not** contain: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (already confirmed present), and Y (sometimes used as a vowel).

Since we need a 5-letter word with I in position 4 and U somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5), let’s brainstorm possibilities:

- C H U I K → CHUIK (not a valid word)  
- C U I K Y → (invalid length)  
- M U I C H → (I must be in position 4)  
- C H U I D → CHUID (not valid)  
- M U I D Y → (invalid)  
- C U I D Y → (invalid)  
- F U I C H → (invalid)  
- P U I C H → (invalid)  
- C U I P Y → (invalid)  
- C H U I K → (invalid)  

A valid word that fits: **CHUID** is not valid.  
Another valid word: **MUCKY** – but I is not in position 4.  
Another: **PUCKY** – same issue.  

Wait: we need I in position 4.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words with I in position 4 and no forbidden letters:

- C H U I K → invalid  
- C H U I D → invalid  
- M U I C H → invalid  
- F U I C H → invalid  
- P U I C H → invalid  
- C U I D Y → invalid  
- C H U I K → invalid  

Actually, let’s think differently:  
We have pattern _ _ _ I _ with U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible valid words:
- **D U I K Y** – but K and Y are uncommon.  
- **C H U I K** – invalid.  
- **M U I C H** – invalid.  
- **F U I C H** – invalid.  
- **P U I C H** – invalid.  
- **C U I D Y** – invalid.  

Wait, let me check a dictionary for valid 5-letter words with I in position 4 and containing U but not in position 1, and avoiding A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L.

A valid word is **CHUID**? No.  
Another: **MUCKY** – but I is not in position 4.  

Actually, let me think of **FUDGY** – but I is not in position 4.  

Wait, let me systematically build:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
We know: _ _ _ I _  
And U must appear in 2, 3, or 5.  
Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- Position 2 = U: _ U _ I _  
  - C U _ I _ → C U B I D, C U D I K, C U M I D, C U P I D, C U H I D, etc.  
  Valid words:  
  - C U D I K – invalid  
  - C U M I D – invalid  
  - C U P I D – valid (CUPID)  
  - C U H I D – invalid  
  - M U C I D – valid (MUCID)  
  - P U C I D – valid (PUCID)  
  - F U C I D – valid (FUCID)  
  - H U C I D – invalid  
  - K U C I D – invalid  

- Position 3 = U: _ _ U I _  
  - C H U I K – invalid  
  - C M U I K – invalid  
  - C P U I K – invalid  
  - M C U I K – invalid  
  - P C U I K – invalid  
  - H C U I K – invalid  
  - D U U I K – invalid  
  - C D U I K – invalid  
  - C G U I K – invalid  
  - C H U I K – invalid  

- Position 5 = U: _ _ _ I U  
  - C H D I U – invalid  
  - C M D I U – invalid  
  - C P D I U – invalid  
  - M C D I U – invalid  
  - P C D I U – invalid  
  - H C D I U – invalid  
  - C H M I U – invalid  
  - C H P I U – invalid  
  - C H G I U – invalid  
  - C H K I U – invalid  

The most promising valid word from above is **CUPID** (C U P I D).  
It fits:
- I is in position 4 (✓)  
- U is in position 2 (not position 1, so allowed)  
- Letters used: C, U, P, I, D – none of which are forbidden (A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L are excluded).  

Therefore, **CUPID** is a strong next guess.

Let's summarize what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ U _ I D  
   (positions 2 = U, 4 = I, 5 = D are locked)

2. Forbidden letters (never appear):  
   A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, P

3. Letters that have appeared and their status:  
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - U is in position 2.  
   - I is in position 4.  
   - D is in position 5.  

4. Remaining consonants we can still use (common ones):  
   B, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.

5. We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern:  
   [not C] C [somewhere] U [somewhere] I [somewhere] D

   But since positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed, the word must be:  
   _ U _ I D with the missing letters in positions 1 and 3.

   Also, C must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1 and 3.  
   But C is NOT allowed in position 1 (feedback for CUPID showed C(-)), so C must be in position 3.

   Therefore the pattern is: _ U C I D

6. Valid 5-letter English words ending in ""UCID"" – only one:  
   M U C I D → ""MUCID"" (though it's uncommon).  
   Another: B U C I D – not a valid word.  
   F U C I D – valid (as in ""fucidin"").  
   H U C I D – invalid.  
   K U C I D – invalid.  
   G U C I D – invalid.  

   The most plausible valid word is **FUCID**.

   Let's verify:  
   - F, U, C, I, D – none are forbidden.  
   - C is in position 3 (allowed, since C is in word but not position 1).  
   - U, I, D are correctly placed.  

   Therefore, **FUCID** is the logical next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in AROSE—A, R, O, S, E—are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid those letters entirely.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that:
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- contains common remaining letters to test new ones quickly

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good vowels still available: I, U (and sometimes Y).

A balanced choice that covers several fresh high-frequency letters is “UNTIL”:

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: CUPID -> FEEDBACK: C(-) U(✓) P(x) I(✓) D(✓)

Let's summarize what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ U _ I D  
   (positions 2 = U, 4 = I, 5 = D are locked)

2. Forbidden letters (never appear):  
   A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, P

3. Letters that have appeared and their status:  
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - U is in position 2.  
   - I is in position 4.  
   - D is in position 5.  

4. Remaining consonants we can still use (common ones):  
   B, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.

5. We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern:  
   [not C] C [somewhere] U [somewhere] I [somewhere] D

   But since positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed, the word must be:  
   _ U _ I D with the missing letters in positions 1 and 3.

   Also, C must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1 and 3.  
   But C is NOT allowed in position 1 (feedback for CUPID showed C(-)), so C must be in position 3.

   Therefore the pattern is: _ U C I D

6. Valid 5-letter English words ending in ""UCID"" – only one:  
   M U C I D → ""MUCID"" (though it's uncommon).  
   Another: B U C I D – not a valid word.  
   F U C I D – valid (as in ""fucidin"").  
   H U C I D – invalid.  
   K U C I D – invalid.  
   G U C I D – invalid.  

   The most plausible valid word is **FUCID**.

   Let's verify:  
   - F, U, C, I, D – none are forbidden.  
   - C is in position 3 (allowed, since C is in word but not position 1).  
   - U, I, D are correctly placed.  

   Therefore, **FUCID** is the logical next guess.
