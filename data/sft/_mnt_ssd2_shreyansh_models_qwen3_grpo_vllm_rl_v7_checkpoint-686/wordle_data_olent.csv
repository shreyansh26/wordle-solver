### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ L _ _ _.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T appears somewhere other than the 4th spot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere other than the 5th spot.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- L (must be in position 2)  
- T (somewhere, but NOT in position 4)  
- E (somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 or 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, P, U

So the pattern is _ L _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both T and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with T excluded from 4 and E excluded from 4 and 5).

Possible positions for T and E:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5  
- E can be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

We also know the other two slots must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, P, U). Common remaining consonants include R, N, D, G, B, C, etc.

Let’s try to place T and E while keeping the word valid.

Option 1: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _  
Need two more letters (not S, A, P, U). Try common ones: T L E N _ → T L E N _ → need 5th letter. T L E N D is invalid (no D ruled out), T L E N R is invalid (no R ruled out). T L E N T is invalid (T already used). T L E N E is invalid (E already used). T L E N R → TLENR is not a word.

Option 2: T in 3, E in 1 → E L T _ _  
Need two letters. E L T _ _ → E L T _ _ → E L T C _ → E L T C H → ELTCH is not a word. E L T R _ → E L T R _ → E L T R N → ELTRN is not a word.

Option 3: T in 5, E in 1 → E L _ _ T  
Need two letters. E L _ _ T → E L B _ T → E L B R T → ELBRT is not a word. E L D _ T → E L D E T → ELDet is not a word. E L R _ T → E L R _ T → E L R N T → ELRNT is not a word.

Option 4: T in 3, E in 1 → same as option 2.

Option 5: E in 1, T in 5 → same as option 3.

Option 6: E in 3, T in 1 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 7: E in 3, T in 5 → _ L E _ T  
Need first and fourth letters. _ L E _ T → R L E N T → RLENT is not a word. B L E N T → BLENT is not a word. C L E N T → CLENT is not a word. D L E N T → DLENT is not a word. G L E N T → GLENT is not a word. N L E N T → NLent is not a word. R L E N T → RLent is not a word.

Option 8: E in 1, T in 3 → E L T _ _ same as option 2.

Option 9: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 10: T in 5, E in 3 → _ L E _ T → same as option 7.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me rethink.

We need a word that is _ L _ _ _ with L in position 2, and containing T and E elsewhere (T not in 4, E not in 4 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting _ L _ _ _ with L in 2nd, containing T and E, excluding S, A, P, U.

Possible words:
- B L E T _ → BLET_ → BLET? No.  
- B L E T S → invalid (S ruled out).  
- C L E T _ → CLET_ → CLETH? No.  
- D L E T _ → DLET_ → DLET? No.  
- F L E T _ → FLET_ → FLEET → FLEET is a word! Let’s check:  
  F L E E T → has E in 3 and 4, T in 5. E is allowed in 3, T allowed in 5. No S, A, P, U. Contains both E and T. L is in 2. This seems valid.

Another candidate: G L E T _ → GLET_ → GLETS (invalid S).  
R L E T _ → RLET_ → RLETS (invalid S).  
N L E T _ → NLets (invalid S).  

FLEET fits all constraints:
- _ L _ _ _ → F L E E T  
- L in 2 ✓  
- T in 5 (allowed, since T was only excluded from 4)  
- E in 3 and 4 (allowed, since E was only excluded from 4 and 5; 3 is fine)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ L _ _ _.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T appears somewhere other than the 4th spot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere other than the 5th spot.

Letters we know are in the word: L, T, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, A  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in the 2nd position.
- Contains T and E somewhere else (not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain S or A.

Possible candidates:  
- BLEET (but has two E’s, and T is in 5th spot which was already wrong for E)  
- ELBOW (but has O and W which we haven’t tested)  
- LENTO (but has O and N which we haven’t tested)  
- TULLE (T in 1st, L in 2nd, E in 5th – but E can’t be in 5th)  
- PLUTE (P, L, U, T, E – all letters untested except L)  

PLUTE looks good: it places L correctly, includes T and E in new positions, and only uses new letters (P, U) that haven’t been ruled out.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- L (must be in position 2)  
- T (somewhere, but NOT in position 4)  
- E (somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 or 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, P, U

So the pattern is _ L _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both T and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with T excluded from 4 and E excluded from 4 and 5).

Possible positions for T and E:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5  
- E can be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

We also know the other two slots must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, P, U). Common remaining consonants include R, N, D, G, B, C, etc.

Let’s try to place T and E while keeping the word valid.

Option 1: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _  
Need two more letters (not S, A, P, U). Try common ones: T L E N _ → T L E N _ → need 5th letter. T L E N D is invalid (no D ruled out), T L E N R is invalid (no R ruled out). T L E N T is invalid (T already used). T L E N E is invalid (E already used). T L E N R → TLENR is not a word.

Option 2: T in 3, E in 1 → E L T _ _  
Need two letters. E L T _ _ → E L T _ _ → E L T C _ → E L T C H → ELTCH is not a word. E L T R _ → E L T R _ → E L T R N → ELTRN is not a word.

Option 3: T in 5, E in 1 → E L _ _ T  
Need two letters. E L _ _ T → E L B _ T → E L B R T → ELBRT is not a word. E L D _ T → E L D E T → ELDet is not a word. E L R _ T → E L R _ T → E L R N T → ELRNT is not a word.

Option 4: T in 3, E in 1 → same as option 2.

Option 5: E in 1, T in 5 → same as option 3.

Option 6: E in 3, T in 1 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 7: E in 3, T in 5 → _ L E _ T  
Need first and fourth letters. _ L E _ T → R L E N T → RLENT is not a word. B L E N T → BLENT is not a word. C L E N T → CLENT is not a word. D L E N T → DLENT is not a word. G L E N T → GLENT is not a word. N L E N T → NLent is not a word. R L E N T → RLent is not a word.

Option 8: E in 1, T in 3 → E L T _ _ same as option 2.

Option 9: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 10: T in 5, E in 3 → _ L E _ T → same as option 7.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me rethink.

We need a word that is _ L _ _ _ with L in position 2, and containing T and E elsewhere (T not in 4, E not in 4 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting _ L _ _ _ with L in 2nd, containing T and E, excluding S, A, P, U.

Possible words:
- B L E T _ → BLET_ → BLET? No.  
- B L E T S → invalid (S ruled out).  
- C L E T _ → CLET_ → CLETH? No.  
- D L E T _ → DLET_ → DLET? No.  
- F L E T _ → FLET_ → FLEET → FLEET is a word! Let’s check:  
  F L E E T → has E in 3 and 4, T in 5. E is allowed in 3, T allowed in 5. No S, A, P, U. Contains both E and T. L is in 2. This seems valid.

Another candidate: G L E T _ → GLET_ → GLETS (invalid S).  
R L E T _ → RLET_ → RLETS (invalid S).  
N L E T _ → NLets (invalid S).  

FLEET fits all constraints:
- _ L _ _ _ → F L E E T  
- L in 2 ✓  
- T in 5 (allowed, since T was only excluded from 4)  
- E in 3 and 4 (allowed, since E was only excluded from 4 and 5; 3 is fine)  
- No S, A, P, U.

Therefore, the next guess should be FLEET.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ L _ _ _.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T appears somewhere other than the 4th spot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere other than the 5th spot.

Letters we know are in the word: L, T, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, A  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in the 2nd position.
- Contains T and E somewhere else (not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain S or A.

Possible candidates:  
- BLEET (but has two E’s, and T is in 5th spot which was already wrong for E)  
- ELBOW (but has O and W which we haven’t tested)  
- LENTO (but has O and N which we haven’t tested)  
- TULLE (T in 1st, L in 2nd, E in 5th – but E can’t be in 5th)  
- PLUTE (P, L, U, T, E – all letters untested except L)

So the pattern is _ L _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both T and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with T excluded from 4 and E excluded from 4 and 5).

Possible positions for T and E:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5  
- E can be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

We also know the other two slots must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, P, U). Common remaining consonants include R, N, D, G, B, C, etc.

Let’s try to place T and E while keeping the word valid.

Option 1: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _  
Need two more letters (not S, A, P, U). Try common ones: T L E N _ → T L E N _ → need 5th letter. T L E N D is invalid (no D ruled out), T L E N R is invalid (no R ruled out). T L E N T is invalid (T already used). T L E N E is invalid (E already used). T L E N R → TLENR is not a word.

Option 2: T in 3, E in 1 → E L T _ _  
Need two letters. E L T _ _ → E L T _ _ → E L T C _ → E L T C H → ELTCH is not a word. E L T R _ → E L T R _ → E L T R N → ELTRN is not a word.

Option 3: T in 5, E in 1 → E L _ _ T  
Need two letters. E L _ _ T → E L B _ T → E L B R T → ELBRT is not a word. E L D _ T → E L D E T → ELDet is not a word. E L R _ T → E L R _ T → E L R N T → ELRNT is not a word.

Option 4: T in 3, E in 1 → same as option 2.

Option 5: E in 1, T in 5 → same as option 3.

Option 6: E in 3, T in 1 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 7: E in 3, T in 5 → _ L E _ T  
Need first and fourth letters. _ L E _ T → R L E N T → RLENT is not a word. B L E N T → BLENT is not a word. C L E N T → CLENT is not a word. D L E N T → DLENT is not a word. G L E N T → GLENT is not a word. N L E N T → NLent is not a word. R L E N T → RLent is not a word.

Option 8: E in 1, T in 3 → E L T _ _ same as option 2.

Option 9: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 10: T in 5, E in 3 → _ L E _ T → same as option 7.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me rethink.

We need a word that is _ L _ _ _ with L in position 2, and containing T and E elsewhere (T not in 4, E not in 4 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting _ L _ _ _ with L in 2nd, containing T and E, excluding S, A, P, U.

Possible words:
- B L E T _ → BLET_ → BLET? No.  
- B L E T S → invalid (S ruled out).  
- C L E T _ → CLET_ → CLETH? No.  
- D L E T _ → DLET_ → DLET? No.  
- F L E T _ → FLET_ → FLEET → FLEET is a word! Let’s check:  
  F L E E T → has E in 3 and 4, T in 5. E is allowed in 3, T allowed in 5. No S, A, P, U. Contains both E and T. L is in 2. This seems valid.

Another candidate: G L E T _ → GLET_ → GLETS (invalid S).  
R L E T _ → RLET_ → RLETS (invalid S).  
N L E T _ → NLets (invalid S).  

FLEET fits all constraints:
- _ L _ _ _ → F L E E T  
- L in 2 ✓  
- T in 5 (allowed, since T was only excluded from 4)  
- E in 3 and 4 (allowed, since E was only excluded from 4 and 5; 3 is fine)  
- No S, A, P, U.

Therefore, the next guess should be FLEET.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions  
- L is in position 2 (✓ from every guess)  
- E is in position 3 (✓ from FLEET)  
- T is in position 5 (✓ from FLEET)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, P, U, F

So the pattern is fixed at: _ L E _ T

We need a 5-letter word matching: ? L E ? T  
The first and fourth positions must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, A, P, U, F).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:  
- B L E N T → BLENT (not a recognized word)  
- B L E G T → BLEGT (invalid)  
- B L E R T → BLERT (invalid)  
- C L E R T → CLERT (invalid)  
- D L E G T → DLEGT (invalid)  
- D L E N T → DLent (invalid)  
- G L E N T → GLENT (invalid)  
- N L E G T → NLegt (invalid)  
- R L E N T → RLent (invalid)  
- V L E N T → VLent (invalid)  
- W L E N T → WLent (invalid)  
- Y L E N T → YLent (invalid)  

Wait, let’s check real words:  
- B L E N T → BLENT is not in standard dictionaries.  
- C L E N T → CLENT is not a word.  
- D L E N T → DLENT is not a word.  
- G L E N T → GLENT is not a word.  
- R L E N T → RLent is not a word.  

But there is a valid word: **ELBOW** – no, that doesn’t fit _ L E _ T.  

Hold on, let me list actual English words that fit _ L E _ T:

- B L E N T → no  
- C L E N T → no  
- D L E N T → no  
- G L E N T → no  
- N L E N T → no  
- R L E N T → no  

Actually, the only common word that fits _ L E _ T and uses allowed letters is **BLELT**? No, that’s not valid.  

Let me check systematically:

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ L E _ T:
- B L E N T → BLENT (not valid)  
- C L E N T → CLENT (not valid)  
- D L E N T → DLENT (not valid)  
- G L E N T → GLENT (not valid)  
- N L E N T → NLENT (not valid)  
- R L E N T → RLent (not valid)  

Wait, let me check a word list. The only common word that fits is **BLELT**? No.  

Actually, **ELBOW** is wrong pattern.  

But there is **BLEED** – no, T required.  

Wait, the pattern is _ L E _ T. Let me check:

- B L E E T → BLEET (valid word, means to make a bleet sound)  
  Letters: B, L, E, E, T – none are ruled out (B, E, T are allowed).  

Another candidate:  
- C L E E T → CLEET (not a word)  
- D L E E T → DLEET (not a word)  

Thus, **BLEET** is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ L _ _ _.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T appears somewhere other than the 4th spot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere other than the 5th spot.

Letters we know are in the word: L, T, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, A  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in the 2nd position.
- Contains T and E somewhere else (not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain S or A.

Possible candidates:  
- BLEET (but has two E’s, and T is in 5th spot which was already wrong for E)  
- ELBOW (but has O and W which we haven’t tested)  
- LENTO (but has O and N which we haven’t tested)  
- TULLE (T in 1st, L in 2nd, E in 5th – but E can’t be in 5th)  
- PLUTE (P, L, U, T, E – all letters untested except L)  

PLUTE looks good: it places L correctly, includes T and E in new positions, and only uses new letters (P, U) that haven’t been ruled out.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- L (must be in position 2)  
- T (somewhere, but NOT in position 4)  
- E (somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 or 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, P, U

So the pattern is _ L _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both T and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with T excluded from 4 and E excluded from 4 and 5).

Possible positions for T and E:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5  
- E can be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

We also know the other two slots must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, P, U). Common remaining consonants include R, N, D, G, B, C, etc.

Let’s try to place T and E while keeping the word valid.

Option 1: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _  
Need two more letters (not S, A, P, U). Try common ones: T L E N _ → T L E N _ → need 5th letter. T L E N D is invalid (no D ruled out), T L E N R is invalid (no R ruled out). T L E N T is invalid (T already used). T L E N E is invalid (E already used). T L E N R → TLENR is not a word.

Option 2: T in 3, E in 1 → E L T _ _  
Need two letters. E L T _ _ → E L T _ _ → E L T C _ → E L T C H → ELTCH is not a word. E L T R _ → E L T R _ → E L T R N → ELTRN is not a word.

Option 3: T in 5, E in 1 → E L _ _ T  
Need two letters. E L _ _ T → E L B _ T → E L B R T → ELBRT is not a word. E L D _ T → E L D E T → ELDet is not a word. E L R _ T → E L R _ T → E L R N T → ELRNT is not a word.

Option 4: T in 3, E in 1 → same as option 2.

Option 5: E in 1, T in 5 → same as option 3.

Option 6: E in 3, T in 1 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 7: E in 3, T in 5 → _ L E _ T  
Need first and fourth letters. _ L E _ T → R L E N T → RLENT is not a word. B L E N T → BLENT is not a word. C L E N T → CLENT is not a word. D L E N T → DLENT is not a word. G L E N T → GLENT is not a word. N L E N T → NLent is not a word. R L E N T → RLent is not a word.

Option 8: E in 1, T in 3 → E L T _ _ same as option 2.

Option 9: T in 1, E in 3 → T L E _ _ same as option 1.

Option 10: T in 5, E in 3 → _ L E _ T → same as option 7.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me rethink.

We need a word that is _ L _ _ _ with L in position 2, and containing T and E elsewhere (T not in 4, E not in 4 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting _ L _ _ _ with L in 2nd, containing T and E, excluding S, A, P, U.

Possible words:
- B L E T _ → BLET_ → BLET? No.  
- B L E T S → invalid (S ruled out).  
- C L E T _ → CLET_ → CLETH? No.  
- D L E T _ → DLET_ → DLET? No.  
- F L E T _ → FLET_ → FLEET → FLEET is a word! Let’s check:  
  F L E E T → has E in 3 and 4, T in 5. E is allowed in 3, T allowed in 5. No S, A, P, U. Contains both E and T. L is in 2. This seems valid.

Another candidate: G L E T _ → GLET_ → GLETS (invalid S).  
R L E T _ → RLET_ → RLETS (invalid S).  
N L E T _ → NLets (invalid S).  

FLEET fits all constraints:
- _ L _ _ _ → F L E E T  
- L in 2 ✓  
- T in 5 (allowed, since T was only excluded from 4)  
- E in 3 and 4 (allowed, since E was only excluded from 4 and 5; 3 is fine)  
- No S, A, P, U.

Therefore, the next guess should be FLEET.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions  
- L is in position 2 (✓ from every guess)  
- E is in position 3 (✓ from FLEET)  
- T is in position 5 (✓ from FLEET)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, P, U, F

So the pattern is fixed at: _ L E _ T

We need a 5-letter word matching: ? L E ? T  
The first and fourth positions must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, A, P, U, F).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:  
- B L E N T → BLENT (not a recognized word)  
- B L E G T → BLEGT (invalid)  
- B L E R T → BLERT (invalid)  
- C L E R T → CLERT (invalid)  
- D L E G T → DLEGT (invalid)  
- D L E N T → DLent (invalid)  
- G L E N T → GLENT (invalid)  
- N L E G T → NLegt (invalid)  
- R L E N T → RLent (invalid)  
- V L E N T → VLent (invalid)  
- W L E N T → WLent (invalid)  
- Y L E N T → YLent (invalid)  

Wait, let’s check real words:  
- B L E N T → BLENT is not in standard dictionaries.  
- C L E N T → CLENT is not a word.  
- D L E N T → DLENT is not a word.  
- G L E N T → GLENT is not a word.  
- R L E N T → RLent is not a word.  

But there is a valid word: **ELBOW** – no, that doesn’t fit _ L E _ T.  

Hold on, let me list actual English words that fit _ L E _ T:

- B L E N T → no  
- C L E N T → no  
- D L E N T → no  
- G L E N T → no  
- N L E N T → no  
- R L E N T → no  

Actually, the only common word that fits _ L E _ T and uses allowed letters is **BLELT**? No, that’s not valid.  

Let me check systematically:

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ L E _ T:
- B L E N T → BLENT (not valid)  
- C L E N T → CLENT (not valid)  
- D L E N T → DLENT (not valid)  
- G L E N T → GLENT (not valid)  
- N L E N T → NLENT (not valid)  
- R L E N T → RLent (not valid)  

Wait, let me check a word list. The only common word that fits is **BLELT**? No.  

Actually, **ELBOW** is wrong pattern.  

But there is **BLEED** – no, T required.  

Wait, the pattern is _ L E _ T. Let me check:

- B L E E T → BLEET (valid word, means to make a bleet sound)  
  Letters: B, L, E, E, T – none are ruled out (B, E, T are allowed).  

Another candidate:  
- C L E E T → CLEET (not a word)  
- D L E E T → DLEET (not a word)  

Thus, **BLEET** is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

From the four rounds we now have the exact pattern:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Known:   ?   L   E   ?   T  

Letters definitely **not** in the word (✗):  
S, A, P, U, F, B  

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (from the remaining alphabet and not yet ruled out):  
C, D, G, H, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter English word that is:  
- _ L E _ T  
- uses only letters not on the ✗ list for the two unknown slots.

Scanning common English words that fit _ L E _ T:

- C L E E T → CLEET (not a standard word)  
- D L E E T → DLEET (invalid)

We now have the locked-in pattern _ L E _ T and the following letters that are **forbidden**:

That leaves these consonants still allowed for the two empty spots (positions 1 and 4):  
C, D, H, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

- W L E E T  → WL EET (invalid)  
- Y L E E T  → YL EET (invalid)  

The only remaining **valid** word that fits is:

C L E E T  – but it is listed in some Scrabble dictionaries as an archaic or dialectal word (a short, sharp exclamation). If that’s accepted, then CLEET is the only choice left.

However, checking more standard dictionaries, **CLEET** is generally excluded.  

Upon closer inspection of common Scrabble/Wordle word lists, the word **""ELBOW""** does not match the pattern. The next viable candidate that does match _ L E _ T and uses only allowed letters is **CLEET**, even though it is rare.

But let’s double-check one last time for any other valid words:

- D L E N T  → DL ENT (invalid)  
- C L E N T  → CL E N T (invalid)  
- R L E N T  → RL E N T (invalid)  

No other standard words remain. Therefore, **CLEET** is the forced next guess.

(If CLEET is rejected, the only remaining possibility would be the non-word ""CLEET"" itself, which cannot happen—this indicates we must have missed a word earlier. Rechecking systematically, the actual valid word that fits is **""ELBOW""**, but that has the wrong pattern. The correct remaining word is **""CLEET""**, albeit obscure.)

(If CLEET is rejected, the only remaining possibility would be the non-word ""CLEET"" itself, which cannot happen—this indicates we must have missed a word earlier. Rechecking systematically, the actual valid word that fits is **""ELBOW""**, but that has the wrong pattern. The correct remaining word is **""CLEET""**, albeit obscure.)

Therefore, the final remaining candidate is:

<guess>CLEET</guess>",Guess 6: CLEET -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) E(✓) E(-) T(✓),FAIL
