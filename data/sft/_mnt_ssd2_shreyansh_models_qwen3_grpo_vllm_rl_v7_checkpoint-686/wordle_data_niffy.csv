For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is not in the 4th position.

Letters we still have to work with: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses N (but not in position 4).
- Avoids C, R, A, E.

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that introduces several new common letters while placing N in a different position. Common letters not yet tried include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – but E is already ruled out.
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) – no N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is not in the 4th position.

Letters we still have to work with: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses N (but not in position 4).
- Avoids C, R, A, E.

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that introduces several new common letters while placing N in a different position. Common letters not yet tried include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – but E is already ruled out.
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) – no N.
- UNITS (U, N, I, T, S) – N in position 2, uses U, I, T, S. All letters are new and common.

Let’s go with UNITS.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
UNITS → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) S(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T, S.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N (from CRANE) and I (from UNITS).
3. Therefore the word must contain both N and I, and:
   - N is not in position 4 (from CRANE).
   - I is not in position 3 (from UNITS).

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, U, T, S.
- Places N somewhere other than position 4.
- Places I somewhere other than position 3.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is ""BLIND"":
- Letters: B, L, I, N, D — all allowed.
- N is in position 4 → but CRANE told us N is NOT in position 4. So BLIND is invalid.

Next candidate: ""MINOR"":
- Letters: M, I, N, O, R — but R is ruled out. Invalid.

Next: ""WINDY"":
- Letters: W, I, N, D, Y — all allowed.
- N is in position 3 (allowed; only position 4 is forbidden).
- I is in position 2 (allowed; only position 3 is forbidden).

""WINDY"" meets all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N, but N is not in the 4th position.

Letters we still have to work with: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses N (but not in position 4).
- Avoids C, R, A, E.

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that introduces several new common letters while placing N in a different position. Common letters not yet tried include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – but E is already ruled out.
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) – no N.
- UNITS (U, N, I, T, S) – N in position 2, uses U, I, T, S. All letters are new and common.

Let’s go with UNITS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
UNITS → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) S(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T, S.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N (from CRANE) and I (from UNITS).
3. Therefore the word must contain both N and I, and:
   - N is not in position 4 (from CRANE).
   - I is not in position 3 (from UNITS).

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, U, T, S.
- Places N somewhere other than position 4.
- Places I somewhere other than position 3.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is ""BLIND"":
- Letters: B, L, I, N, D — all allowed.
- N is in position 4 → but CRANE told us N is NOT in position 4. So BLIND is invalid.

Next candidate: ""MINOR"":
- Letters: M, I, N, O, R — but R is ruled out. Invalid.

Next: ""WINDY"":
- Letters: W, I, N, D, Y — all allowed.
- N is in position 3 (allowed; only position 4 is forbidden).
- I is in position 2 (allowed; only position 3 is forbidden).

""WINDY"" meets all constraints.

Guess 3: WINDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. UNITS → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) S(x)  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. WINDY → W(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(✓)  
   – I is correctly placed in position 2.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – Letters W and D are NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Fixed letters:  
  – Position 2 = I  
  – Position 5 = Y  
- Must contain: N (and N cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).  
- Cannot contain: C, R, A, E, U, T, S, W, D.  
- Allowed letters (besides I and Y): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, X, Z.

The only remaining position for N is position 1.

So the pattern is: N I _ _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with N, has I in position 2, ends with Y, and uses only the allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible combinations:
- N I L L Y → “NILLY” (valid English word, all letters allowed).  
- N I M M Y → not a word.  
- N I L O Y → not a word.  
- N I L K Y → not a word.  
- N I L G Y → not a word.  
- N I L B Y → not a word.  
- N I L F Y → not a word.  
- N I L V Y → not a word.  
- N I L H Y → not a word.  
- N I L P Y → not a word.  
- N I L O Y → not a word.  
- N I L K Y → not a word.  
- N I L J Y → not a word.  
- N I L Q Y → not a word.  
- N I L Z Y → not a word.

The only valid English word fitting N I _ _ Y with allowed letters is NILLY.

Therefore, the next guess is NILLY.
