For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is NOT in the word
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5)

So we know:
- Positions: _ _ A T _
- Letters in word: S, A, T, E
- Letters not in word: L
- S cannot be in position 1
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and T in position 4
- Contains S and E somewhere (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain L

Possible patterns: _ _ A T _ with S and E to place.

Possible candidates:
- STEAK (but has K, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- SPEAT (not a valid word)
- SWATE (not a valid word)
- SHATE (not a valid word)
- HEART (but has H, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- GREAT (but has G, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- CRATE (has C, but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- BRATE (has B, but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- SHARE (has H, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)

Looking at valid words:
- HEART - invalid (E in position 5)
- GREAT - invalid (E in position 5)
- SHARE - invalid (E in position 5)
- STEAK - invalid (E in position 5)
- SPEAT - invalid (not a word)
- CRATE - invalid (E in position 5)
- BRATE - invalid (E in position 5)

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ _ A T _ with S and E somewhere, but not in their original positions (S not in 1, E not in 5).

Possible placements:
- S could be in position 2 or 5
- E could be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is A), so positions 1 or 2

But position 3 is A, position 4 is T, so:
Possible word structure:
- Position 1: E or S
- Position 2: E or S
- Position 5: S (since S can't be in 1, and 3,4 are taken)

But if S is in position 5, then E must be in position 1 or 2.

Looking for words:
- E S A T S - not valid
- E _ A T S - need valid word
- _ E A T S - need valid word

- BEATS - has B, valid word
- DEATS - not valid

Among these, HEATS seems strongest as H is common.

But let's check HEATS:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is NOT in the word
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5)

So we know:
- Positions: _ _ A T _
- Letters in word: S, A, T, E
- Letters not in word: L
- S cannot be in position 1
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and T in position 4
- Contains S and E somewhere (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain L

Possible patterns: _ _ A T _ with S and E to place.

Possible candidates:
- STEAK (but has K, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- SPEAT (not a valid word)
- SWATE (not a valid word)
- SHATE (not a valid word)
- HEART (but has H, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- GREAT (but has G, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- CRATE (has C, but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- BRATE (has B, but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- SHARE (has H, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)

Looking at valid words:
- HEART - invalid (E in position 5)
- GREAT - invalid (E in position 5)
- SHARE - invalid (E in position 5)
- STEAK - invalid (E in position 5)
- SPEAT - invalid (not a word)
- CRATE - invalid (E in position 5)
- BRATE - invalid (E in position 5)

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ _ A T _ with S and E somewhere, but not in their original positions (S not in 1, E not in 5).

Possible placements:
- S could be in position 2 or 5
- E could be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is A), so positions 1 or 2

But position 3 is A, position 4 is T, so:
Possible word structure:
- Position 1: E or S
- Position 2: E or S
- Position 5: S (since S can't be in 1, and 3,4 are taken)

But if S is in position 5, then E must be in position 1 or 2.

Looking for words:
- E S A T S - not valid
- E _ A T S - need valid word
- _ E A T S - need valid word

Valid words fitting _ E A T _ or E _ A T _:
- HEATS - has H, valid word
- BEATS - has B, valid word
- DEATS - not valid
- FEATS - has F, valid word
- YEATS - has Y, valid word

Among these, HEATS seems strongest as H is common.

But let's check HEATS:
- H E A T S
- A is position 3 ✓
- T is position 4 ✓
- S is position 5 (was originally position 1, now new position - ok)
- E is position 2 (was originally position 5, now new position - ok)
- No L - ok

HEATS seems valid.

Guess 2: HEATS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on HEATS:

- H is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: unknown
Position 2: E
Position 3: A
Position 4: T
Position 5: S

The word looks like: _ E A T S

We need a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and does not contain L or H (from previous feedback).

Possible candidates:
- BEATS (but has B - valid)
- DEATS (not a word)
- FEATS (has F - valid)
- YEATS (has Y - valid)
- NEATS (has N - valid)
- PEATS (has P - valid)

Among these, ""BEATS"" is a common word and seems like the most likely candidate.

We need a 5-letter word that:

Possible placements:

- Position 5: S (since S can't be in 1, and 3,4 are taken)

But if S is in position 5, then E must be in position 1 or 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is NOT in the word
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5)

So we know:
- Positions: _ _ A T _
- Letters in word: S, A, T, E
- Letters not in word: L
- S cannot be in position 1
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and T in position 4
- Contains S and E somewhere (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain L

Possible patterns: _ _ A T _ with S and E to place.

Possible candidates:
- STEAK (but has K, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- SPEAT (not a valid word)
- SWATE (not a valid word)
- SHATE (not a valid word)
- HEART (but has H, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- GREAT (but has G, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- CRATE (has C, but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- BRATE (has B, but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- SHARE (has H, and E is in position 5 which is invalid)

Looking at valid words:
- HEART - invalid (E in position 5)
- GREAT - invalid (E in position 5)
- SHARE - invalid (E in position 5)
- STEAK - invalid (E in position 5)
- SPEAT - invalid (not a word)
- CRATE - invalid (E in position 5)
- BRATE - invalid (E in position 5)

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ _ A T _ with S and E somewhere, but not in their original positions (S not in 1, E not in 5).

Possible placements:
- S could be in position 2 or 5
- E could be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is A), so positions 1 or 2

But position 3 is A, position 4 is T, so:
Possible word structure:
- Position 1: E or S
- Position 2: E or S
- Position 5: S (since S can't be in 1, and 3,4 are taken)

But if S is in position 5, then E must be in position 1 or 2.

Looking for words:
- E S A T S - not valid
- E _ A T S - need valid word
- _ E A T S - need valid word

Valid words fitting _ E A T _ or E _ A T _:
- HEATS - has H, valid word
- BEATS - has B, valid word
- DEATS - not valid
- FEATS - has F, valid word
- YEATS - has Y, valid word

Among these, HEATS seems strongest as H is common.

But let's check HEATS:
- H E A T S
- A is position 3 ✓
- T is position 4 ✓
- S is position 5 (was originally position 1, now new position - ok)
- E is position 2 (was originally position 5, now new position - ok)
- No L - ok

HEATS seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: HEATS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on HEATS:

- H is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: unknown
Position 2: E
Position 3: A
Position 4: T
Position 5: S

The word looks like: _ E A T S

We need a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and does not contain L or H (from previous feedback).

Possible candidates:
- BEATS (but has B - valid)
- DEATS (not a word)
- FEATS (has F - valid)
- YEATS (has Y - valid)
- NEATS (has N - valid)
- PEATS (has P - valid)

Among these, ""BEATS"" is a common word and seems like the most likely candidate.

From the feedback so far we know:

- Pattern: _ E A T S (positions 2-5 are locked)
- Letters NOT in the word: L, H, B
- We still need a valid first letter.

Possible first letters (must form a real 5-letter word ending in EATS):
- C → CEATS (not a word)
- D → DEATS (not a word)
- F → FEATS (valid)
- N → NEATS (valid)
- P → PEATS (valid)
- S → SEATS (valid)
- W → WEATS (not a word)
- Y → YEATS (valid)

Among these, FEATS, NEATS, PEATS, and SEATS are all valid.  
""FEATS"" is a common word and hasn’t been tried yet.

So the next logical guess is FEATS.
