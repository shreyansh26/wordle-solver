### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Let me think through why this is a good choice:
1. A, O, E are very common vowels that appear in many 5-letter words.
2. R and S are among the most common consonants in English.
3. This combination covers 5 distinct letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback.

Therefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

- Contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.

1. Uses R and S.
2. Does not use A, O, or E.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses R and S plus the remaining vowels and consonants.  
A simple candidate is “FIRST”:
- Contains R and S.
- Uses I (a remaining vowel).
- Places R in position 3 (allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed).
- Does not use A, O, or E.

Other possibilities like “TRIPS”, “CRISP”, “DRIPS” are also valid, but “FIRST” feels like a balanced choice.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, I, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, S.
3. Positions so far:
   - R is in position 3 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and FIRST feedback).
   - Therefore S must be in position 1 or 2.
   - F is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from FIRST feedback).
   - Remaining unused consonants: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Remaining unused vowels: U (since A, O, E, I are out).

So the pattern so far:
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- S must be in position 1 or 2
- F must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but 3 is R, so 2, 4, or 5
- We have to use U as the only remaining vowel
- Need two more consonants from the allowed set

Let’s try to build words:
- If S is in position 1: S _ R _ _
- If S is in position 2: _ S R _ _

Let’s try S in position 2:
Word form: _ S R _ _
We need to place F somewhere (positions 2,4,5). Position 2 is S, so F in 4 or 5.
We need U somewhere (positions 1,4,5).
Let’s try F in position 4: _ S R F _
Then U must be in position 1 or 5. Position 5 is open.
So possible: U S R F _ or _ S R F U
But _ S R F U would be _ S R F U, but position 5 can’t be U if we need another consonant.
Wait, we need two consonants plus U.

Actually, let’s list possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
And we have to use U once.

Let’s try a concrete word: “SURFY”
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- U in position 2
- R in position 3 (fixed)
- F in position 4
- Y in position 5
This uses S, U, R, F, Y. All letters are allowed so far.

But let’s check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it can’t be 4 or 5)
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- F is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be 1)
- U is used (only remaining vowel)
- Y is allowed (unused consonant)

This seems valid.

   - Remaining unused consonants: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
