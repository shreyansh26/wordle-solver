### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English words
- L and T are common consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- It tests 5 unique letters

This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in the first position.

- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English words
- L and T are common consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- It tests 5 unique letters

This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in the first position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

We need four more letters that are NOT L, A, T, E.  
Popular consonants that remain available: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A good next step is to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S is already confirmed in position 1.
- O, U, N, D haven’t been tested yet and are all different from the eliminated letters.

This tests two new vowels (O, U) and two new consonants (N, D) while keeping S fixed.

Current knowledge:

So the pattern is: S _ _ _ _ with O somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We still need to test other vowels (I) and consonants (R, C, H, M, P, etc.).

A good next guess would place O in a new position and test fresh letters.  
Let’s try “SHOCK”:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- H, C, K are new consonants.
- O is moved to position 4 to see if that’s correct.

This tests H, C, K and repositions O.

   B, F, G, I, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We still need to test vowels: I is the only common vowel left untested.

5. Good consonants left: R, M, P, B, F, G, V, W, Y.

- Keeps S _ O _ _
- Uses fresh letters, especially I and some of the top remaining consonants.

From the latest feedback on SPIRO:

- S(✓) – fixed in position 1
- P(x), I(x), R(x) – none of these letters appear anywhere in the word
- O(-) – the letter O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already know it’s not in positions 2, 4, or 5 from earlier feedback)

Therefore:
- O must be in position 3 (only remaining slot that has never been ruled out)
- This locks the word pattern as S _ O _ _

Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, P, I, R  
Remaining consonants to test: B, F, G, M, V, W, Y  
We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words matching S _ O _ _ gives:
- SOBBY
- SOGGY
- SOWFY
- SMOKE (but K is out)
- SMOCK (but C and K are out)
- SFOGY
- SVOGY
- SWONY (but N is out)

The simplest valid candidates using remaining letters are:
1. SOBBY – uses B twice (allowed, but less informative)
2. SOGGY – uses G twice
3. SOWFY – uses W and F

Among these, SOWFY tests two new letters (W and F) and the vowel Y (which sometimes acts as a vowel). However, Y is a bit of a stretch.

A better choice is SOGGY, which tests G twice but gives more info about G.

But to maximize information, let’s pick a word that uses two distinct remaining consonants. The best pair is B and M (common and unused).

Candidate: S B O M _ – but we need a 5-letter word. “SBO M?” doesn’t form a word.

Next best: S B O B Y – “SOBBY” (but B is repeated).

Actually, the simplest valid word fitting S _ O _ _ with new letters is SOGGY (G appears twice but is the only new letter that makes sense).

However, G is fine to test twice. Let’s go with SOGGY.

Wait – let’s list all valid S _ O _ _ words with remaining letters:

Remaining consonants: B, F, G, M, V, W, Y

Possible combinations:
- S B O B Y → SOBBY
- S B O G Y → SBOGY (not a valid English word)
- S B O M B → SBOBM (invalid)
- S F O G Y → SFOGY (valid)
- S M O K E → invalid (K, E out)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English words
- L and T are common consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- It tests 5 unique letters

No repeated letters to test more unique letters\n\nPopular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"".

However, Y is a bit of a stretch.\n\nA better choice is SOGGY, which tests G twice but gives more info about G.\n\nBut to maximize information, let’s pick a word that uses two distinct remaining consonants. The best pair is B and M (common and unused).\n\nCandidate: S B O M _ – but we need a 5-letter word. “SBO M?” doesn’t form a word.\n\nNext best: S B O B Y – “SOBBY” (but B is repeated).\n\nActually, the simplest valid word fitting S _ O _ _ with new letters is SOGGY (G appears twice but is the only new letter that makes sense).\n\nHowever, G is fine to test twice.

From the feedback on SMOGG:

- S(✓) – position 1 locked
- M(✓) – position 2 locked
- O(✓) – position 3 locked
- G(✓) – position 4 locked
- G(-) – the second G is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern is: S M O G _

Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, P, I, R, B, F, Y  
Only remaining consonants: V, W, Z (and G, but G is already in position 4)

We need a single letter for position 5 that hasn’t been used yet and forms a valid word.  
The only common English letter left that hasn’t been tried and fits is V.

Word: SMOGV – not valid.  
Next: SMOGW – not valid.  
SMOGZ – not valid.

Wait, let me double-check elimination:

Eliminated list so far:
L, A, T, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, P, I, R, B, F, Y

Remaining consonants: V, W, Z, G (G already used once in position 4)

Valid 5-letter words starting with SMOG:
- SMOKE – K and E eliminated
- SMOGS – S is repeated (allowed but G already used)
- SMOGH – H eliminated
- SMOGO – O already used
- SMOGY – Y eliminated
- SMOGZ – not a word
- SMOGV – not a word
- SMOGW – not a word

The only plausible remaining word is SMOGS, which repeats S but uses G again in position 5. Since G is confirmed in the word (from G(✓) in position 4 and G(-) in position 5), SMOGS is the only valid option.

Therefore, the correct word must be SMOGS.
