### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

- It places E in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).
- It uses U, N, T, I, which are all common and haven't been tested yet.

2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: N and E (both marked “-” in both guesses, so they appear somewhere, but we still don’t know where).

- E is in position 3 (never tested in that spot before).

Therefore E must be in slot 1 or 2.

Remaining unused consonants (still allowed):  
C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels still allowed: none left except E (A, O, U, I already ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- N in position 4
- E in position 1 or 2
- All other letters from the remaining set above

Candidate words:
- E _ _ N _  (E in position 1)
- _ E _ N _  (E in position 2)

Let’s pick the second pattern (_ E _ N _) because it gives us two new consonant slots to test.

A common word fitting _ E _ N _ is “HENNY” but double N is unlikely.  
Another is “VENNY” – also unlikely.  
“MENNY” – same.  
“PENNY” – same.  
“GENNY” – same.  

Let’s try “HENGY” – but Y is allowed, H and G are allowed.  
Actually “HENGY” isn’t a valid English word.

A valid word is “VENNY” – no, that’s not valid.  
“VENNY” isn’t recognized.  
“VENNY” is not a valid English word.

A valid word is “HENGY” – no.  
“VENNY” – no.  
“GENNY” – no.  
“MENNY” – no.  
“PENNY” – valid.

“PENNY” fits:
- P E N N Y
- N is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (new slot)
- P and Y are new letters to test
- Second N is allowed because letters can repeat (though unlikely).

But we already know N is in position 4, so a second N would be in position 5. That’s acceptable for testing.

However, let’s avoid double letters for now to maximize information.

Instead, let’s try “FENNY” – but again double N.  
“JENNY” – same.  
“WENNY” – same.

Let’s try “CENGY” – but not a word.  
“MENGY” – not a word.  
“VENNY” – not a word.  
“HENGY” – not a word.

Let’s try “E _ _ N _” pattern.

A valid word: “ENEMY”
- E N E M Y
- N in position 2 – but we need N in position 4. Doesn’t fit.

“ENEMY” has N in position 2, wrong.

“EMEEN” – invalid.

“EMBEN” – invalid.

“EMYEN” – invalid.

Let’s try “FEMNY” – invalid.

“GEMNY” – invalid.

“HEMNY” – invalid.

“JEMNY” – invalid.

“KEMNY” – invalid.

“LEMNY” – invalid.

“MEMNY” – invalid.

“PEMNY” – invalid.

“QEMNY” – invalid.

“VENNY” – invalid.

“WENNY” – invalid.

“XEMNY” – invalid.

“YENNY” – invalid.

“ZENNY” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s step back.

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- N in position 4
- E in position 1 or 2
- No banned letters

Let’s list valid words fitting _ E _ N _:
- “HENNY” – invalid (double N, not common)
- “VENNY” – invalid
- “GENNY” – invalid
- “MENNY” – invalid
- “PENNY” – valid (though double N)

“PENNY” seems the only valid word fitting _ E _ N _ with allowed letters.

But let’s check E _ _ N _:

Valid words:
- “ENTRY” – but T is banned.
- “ENZYM” – invalid.
- “ENEMA” – A is banned.
- “ENEMY” – N is in position 2, but we need it in 4.

“ENEMY” doesn’t fit.

“EMBEN” – invalid.

“EMGEN” – invalid.

“EMYEN” – invalid.

“ENGEN” – invalid.

“ENHEN” – invalid.

“ENJEN” – invalid.

“ENKEN” – invalid.

“ENLEN” – invalid.

“ENMEN” – invalid.

“ENPEN” – invalid.

“ENVEN” – invalid.

“ENVEN” – invalid.

“ENYEN” – invalid.

It seems the only valid word fitting _ E _ N _ is “HENNY”, but double N is odd.

Let’s try “VENNY” – invalid.

Wait, let’s check “GENNY” – invalid.

“MENNY” – invalid.

“PENNY” – valid.

“PENNY” has:
- P E N N Y
- N in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 2 (new)
- P and Y are new letters

Even though it has double N, it’s the only valid word I can find fitting the constraints.

Let’s use “PENNY”.

But to maximize information, let’s try another approach.

We have:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ N _
- Must contain E (not in 3 or 5)
- So E must be in 1 or 2
- Available letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try “HENGY” – invalid.

“VENNY” – invalid.

“GENNY” – invalid.

“MENNY” – invalid.

“PENNY” – valid.

“JENNY” – valid.

“JENNY” has:
- J E N N Y
- N in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 2 (new)
- J and Y are new letters

“JENNY” seems better than “PENNY” because J is less common and we want to test more unique letters.

But “JENNY” is valid.

Another option: “WENNY” – invalid.

“ZENNY” – invalid.

“CENNY” – invalid.

“FENNY” – invalid.

“GIVEN” – but N is in position 4, so “GIVEN” has N in position 4:
- G I V E N
But I is banned.

“HIVEN” – I banned.

“KIVEN” – I banned.

“LIVEN” – L is banned.

“MIVEN” – I banned.

“RIVEN” – R banned.

“SIVEN” – S banned.

“TIVEN” – T banned.

“UVIVEN” – U banned.

“XIVEN” – I banned.

“YIVEN” – I banned.

“ZIVEN” – I banned.

So no.

“GEMNY” – invalid.

“GENNY” – invalid.

“GEJNY” – invalid.

“GEEKY” – K is allowed, but E is in position 2, N is in 4:
G E E K Y – but N must be in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

“GENNY” – N in 4, E in 2, G in 1, Y in 5 – but “GENNY” is invalid.

“GIVEN” – I banned.

“GONER” – O, R banned.

“GONER” – invalid.

“GONER” – invalid.

Let’s try “H” in position 1 with E in position 2:
H E _ N _
“HEMNY” – invalid.

“HENNY” – valid (though double N).

“HENNY” seems the only valid word.

“HENNY”:
- H E N N Y
- N in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 2 (new)
- H and Y are new letters

This is the best candidate.

<guess>HENNY</guess>",HENNY,"Let’s list everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, L, D

Letters that ARE in the word:  
N (confirmed in position 4)  
E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5)

So the word looks like: _ _ _ N _  
and it must contain at least one E, but E cannot be in slot 3 or 5.

Therefore E must be in slot 1 or 2.

Remaining unused consonants (still allowed):  
C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
