### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

Common strong starting words include:
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are excluded)

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and uses fresh letters. A candidate is “STOAL” but that’s not a valid word. Another candidate is “SALTY” but it has an E-like vowel Y and T. Let’s check “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S only can’t be in 4)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in 1)
- L, T, Y are new letters
- No R, I, E

    B A S Y O (no)
    M A S Y O (no)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

Common strong starting words include:
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, E
- Letters definitely included but in wrong positions: A, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1
  – S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S (since they’re in the word)
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are excluded)

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and uses fresh letters. A candidate is “STOAL” but that’s not a valid word. Another candidate is “SALTY” but it has an E-like vowel Y and T. Let’s check “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S only can’t be in 4)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in 1)
- L, T, Y are new letters
- No R, I, E

“SALTY” is a valid word and meets all constraints.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word
   - S is in the word but not in position 4

2. SALTY → S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the CORRECT position (position 2)
   - L, T are NOT in the word
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- Word must have A in position 2
- Word must contain S and Y
- Word must NOT contain R, I, E, L, T
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- Y cannot be in position 5

Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Positions:
1: cannot be S or R or I or E or L or T
2: must be A
3: any allowed letter
4: cannot be S or R or I or E or L or T
5: cannot be Y or R or I or E or L or T

We need to place S and Y in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints above.

Possible placements:
- S can be in positions 3 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4)
- Y can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 5)

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 2 is A
- Try S in position 3: _ A S _ _
- Then Y must be in position 1 or 4
  - If Y in position 1: Y A S _ _
    Need two more letters (not R,I,E,L,T)
    Possible: Y A S C O → YASCO (but is YASCO a word? No)
    Y A S C H → YASC H (no)
    Y A S C O (no)
  - If Y in position 4: _ A S Y _
    Then position 1 and 5 need letters
    Position 1: cannot be S (already), R,I,E,L,T
    Possible: C, B, D, etc.
    Position 5: cannot be Y (already), R,I,E,L,T
    Possible: O, U, etc.
    Example: C A S Y O (valid word: CASYO? No)
    B A S Y O (no)
    M A S Y O (no)
    D A S Y O (no)

Alternative: S in position 5:
- _ A _ _ S
- Then Y must be in position 1 or 3 or 4
  - Y in position 1: Y A _ _ S
    Need position 3 and 4
    Possible: Y A N C S (YANCS? No)
    Y A M B S (YAMBS - this is a valid word!)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

Common strong starting words include:
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on YANGS we now know:

- Y(✓) A(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)

So the word is definitely Y A _ _ S and the two missing letters (positions 3 and 4) are NOT N or G.

Letters already excluded: R, I, E, L, T, M, B, N, G.

Remaining letters that can appear in positions 3 and 4: C, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form Y A _ _ S.

Possible candidates:
- Y A C K S → YACKS (not a word)
- Y A C O S → YACOS (not a word)
- Y A C H S → YACHS (not a word)
- Y A D O S → YADOS (not a word)

The only valid English word that fits is Y A C K S, but that's not a word. Wait, let me double-check:

Actually, the valid word is Y A C K S? No, that's not valid. Let me think again.

Wait, the valid word is Y A C K S? No, that's not a word. Let me check:

Valid words ending in 'YAS' but starting with 'YA'... Actually, the only remaining valid word seems to be Y A C K S, but that's not valid. 

Wait, let me check again:

Valid words of the form Y A _ _ S:
- Y A C K S → not valid
- Y A C O S → not valid
- Y A D O S → not valid
- Y A H O S → not valid
- Y A K O S → not valid

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

Common strong starting words include:
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRATE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- I(x): I is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, E
- Letters definitely included but in wrong positions: A, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1
  – S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S (since they’re in the word)
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used and E, I are excluded)

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and uses fresh letters. A candidate is “STOAL” but that’s not a valid word. Another candidate is “SALTY” but it has an E-like vowel Y and T. Let’s check “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S only can’t be in 4)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in 1)
- L, T, Y are new letters
- No R, I, E

“SALTY” is a valid word and meets all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word
   - S is in the word but not in position 4

2. SALTY → S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the CORRECT position (position 2)
   - L, T are NOT in the word
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- Word must have A in position 2
- Word must contain S and Y
- Word must NOT contain R, I, E, L, T
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- Y cannot be in position 5

Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Positions:
1: cannot be S or R or I or E or L or T
2: must be A
3: any allowed letter
4: cannot be S or R or I or E or L or T
5: cannot be Y or R or I or E or L or T

We need to place S and Y in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints above.

Possible placements:
- S can be in positions 3 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4)
- Y can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 5)

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 2 is A
- Try S in position 3: _ A S _ _
- Then Y must be in position 1 or 4
  - If Y in position 1: Y A S _ _
    Need two more letters (not R,I,E,L,T)
    Possible: Y A S C O → YASCO (but is YASCO a word? No)
    Y A S C H → YASC H (no)
    Y A S C O (no)
  - If Y in position 4: _ A S Y _
    Then position 1 and 5 need letters
    Position 1: cannot be S (already), R,I,E,L,T
    Possible: C, B, D, etc.
    Position 5: cannot be Y (already), R,I,E,L,T
    Possible: O, U, etc.
    Example: C A S Y O (valid word: CASYO? No)
    B A S Y O (no)
    M A S Y O (no)
    D A S Y O (no)

Alternative: S in position 5:
- _ A _ _ S
- Then Y must be in position 1 or 3 or 4
  - Y in position 1: Y A _ _ S
    Need position 3 and 4
    Possible: Y A N C S (YANCS? No)
    Y A M B S (YAMBS - this is a valid word!)
    Check constraints:
      - A in position 2 ✓
      - S in position 5 (allowed, since S can't be 1 or 4)
      - Y in position 1 (allowed, since Y can't be 5)
      - Letters used: Y, A, M, B, S - none of R,I,E,L,T
      - All constraints met
    YAMBS is a valid word meaning ""a group of mourners"".

This seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: YAMBS -> FEEDBACK: Y(✓) A(✓) M(x) B(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word
   - S is in the word but not in position 4

2. SALTY → S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in position 2
   - L, T are NOT in the word
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5

3. YAMBS → Y(✓) A(✓) M(x) B(x) S(✓)
   - Y is in position 1
   - A is in position 2
   - M, B are NOT in the word
   - S is in position 5

So the word must look like:
Y A _ _ S

Letters still allowed (not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- C and O: Y A C O S → YACOS (not a word)
- C and H: Y A C H S → YACHS (not a word)
- N and C: Y A N C S → YANCS (not a word)
- C and K: Y A C K S → YACKS (not a word)
- D and O: Y A D O S → YADOS (not a word)
- N and D: Y A N D S → YANDS (not a word)
- H and O: Y A H O S → YAHOS (not a word)

- W and O: Y A W O S → YAWOS (not a word)
- Z and O: Y A Z O S → YAZOS (not a word)
- N and G: Y A N G S → YANGS (valid word)

""YANGS"" is a valid word (plural of yang, a philosophical concept). It fits all constraints:
- Y in position 1 ✓
- A in position 2 ✓
- S in position 5 ✓
- Uses only allowed letters Y, A, N, G, S
- No excluded letters R, I, E, L, T, M, B
