### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S somewhere.
- Does not contain O or E.

I want a new guess that keeps A, R, S but moves them to new positions, and avoids O and E. I also want to introduce some new common consonants to test.

Good candidates:
- STARS – but S is already in slot 4 (invalid per feedback).
- CRASH – has C, H (new letters) and moves R out of slot 2, A out of slot 1, S out of slot 4.
- TRASH – same idea as CRASH, with T.
- DRANK – uses D, N, K (new letters) and positions A, R, S differently.

I'll go with TRASH: it has T and H (new), moves A to slot 3, R to slot 2, S to slot 5 (all valid per feedback).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A (not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (not in positions 2 or 2 again, so not position 2)
- S (not in positions 4 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, E, H

So the secret word must contain A, R, and S exactly once each, and two other letters that are not O, E, or H.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3  

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, S, O, E, H). Common remaining consonants include L, N, D, C, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, R, S in valid spots while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “CRANE” but E is excluded. “DRANK” has H excluded. “SCARF” has F (valid) and positions:
- S in 1 (valid)
- C new
- A in 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3)

“SCARS” repeats S. “SCRAM” has M new and positions:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S somewhere.
- Does not contain O or E.
- A cannot be in slot 1, R cannot be in slot 2, S cannot be in slot 4.

I want a new guess that keeps A, R, S but moves them to new positions, and avoids O and E. I also want to introduce some new common consonants to test.

Good candidates:
- STARS – but S is already in slot 4 (invalid per feedback).
- CRASH – has C, H (new letters) and moves R out of slot 2, A out of slot 1, S out of slot 4.
- TRASH – same idea as CRASH, with T.
- DRANK – uses D, N, K (new letters) and positions A, R, S differently.

I'll go with TRASH: it has T and H (new), moves A to slot 3, R to slot 2, S to slot 5 (all valid per feedback).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A (not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (not in positions 2 or 2 again, so not position 2)
- S (not in positions 4 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, E, H

So the secret word must contain A, R, and S exactly once each, and two other letters that are not O, E, or H.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3  

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, S, O, E, H). Common remaining consonants include L, N, D, C, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, R, S in valid spots while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “CRANE” but E is excluded. “DRANK” has H excluded. “SCARF” has F (valid) and positions:
- S in 1 (valid)
- C new
- A in 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3)

“SCARS” repeats S. “SCRAM” has M new and positions:
- S 1 (ok)
- C new
- A 3 (invalid)

“SCRAN” has N new and positions:
- S 1 (ok)
- C new
- R 3 (ok)
- A 4 (ok)
- N new

This seems valid: S, C, R, A, N with no conflicts.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word (and their positions):
- S is in position 1 (from SCRAN and confirmed by SMART).
- A is in position 4 (from SCRAN and confirmed by SMART).

Letters that are definitely in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4; must be in 5)
- T (cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5; must be in 2 or 3)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- O, E, H, C, N, M

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ A _

And we know:
- Position 5 must be R (only remaining spot for R).
- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with T and one other unused letter, since T must be in 2 or 3.

The remaining unused letters (excluding A, S, R, O, E, H, C, N, M) include D, L, P, etc.

Possible words:
- S T _ A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used. From remaining: D, L, P, etc.
  - S T D A R → not a valid word
  - S T L A R → ""STLAR"" – not valid
  - S T P A R → ""STPAR"" – not valid
- S _ T A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used, and T would be in position 2
  - S _ T A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used. From remaining: D, L, P, etc.
  - S D T A R → ""SDTAR"" – not valid
  - S L T A R → ""SL TAR"" – not valid
  - S P T A R → ""SPTAR"" – not valid

Wait, let’s list valid English words that fit S _ _ A R:
- S T A R _ – no, we need 5 letters
- S T _ A R – valid words:
  - S T A R K – but K not yet used
  - S T A R T – T repeated
  - S T A R S – S repeated
  - S T A R E – E excluded
  - S T A R R – R repeated
  - S T A R Y – Y not yet used

""STARY"" is not a common word. Actually, the only common valid word is:
- S T A R K – positions: S(1), T(2), A(4), R(5), K(3)

This fits all constraints:
- S in 1, A in 4, R in 5
- T in 2
- K is new and not excluded

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) – position 1
- T – must be in 2 or 3, here in 2 (allowed)
- A(✓) – position 4
- R – must be in 5 (only spot left)
- K – new letter, not excluded

This seems correct.

- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with T and one other unused letter, since T must be in 2 or 3.

The remaining unused letters (excluding A, S, R, O, E, H, C, N, M) include D, L, P, etc.

Possible words:
- S T _ A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used. From remaining: D, L, P, etc.
  - S T D A R → not a valid word
  - S T L A R → ""STLAR"" – not valid
  - S T P A R → ""STPAR"" – not valid
- S _ T A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used, and T would be in position 2
  - S _ T A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used. From remaining: D, L, P, etc.
  - S D T A R → ""SDTAR"" – not valid
  - S L T A R → ""SL TAR"" – not valid
  - S P T A R → ""SPTAR"" – not valid

Wait, let’s list valid English words that fit S _ _ A R:
- S T A R _ – no, we need 5 letters
- S T _ A R – valid words:
  - S T A R K – but K not yet used
  - S T A R T – T repeated
  - S T A R S – S repeated
  - S T A R E – E excluded
  - S T A R R – R repeated
  - S T A R Y – Y not yet used

""STARY"" is not a common word. Actually, the only common valid word is:
- S T A R K – positions: S(1), T(2), A(4), R(5), K(3)

This fits all constraints:
- S in 1, A in 4, R in 5
- T in 2
- K is new and not excluded

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) – position 1
- T – must be in 2 or 3, here in 2 (allowed)
- A(✓) – position 4
- R – must be in 5 (only spot left)
- K – new letter, not excluded

This seems correct.",Guess 5: STARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) R(-) K(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S somewhere.
- Does not contain O or E.
- A cannot be in slot 1, R cannot be in slot 2, S cannot be in slot 4.

I want a new guess that keeps A, R, S but moves them to new positions, and avoids O and E. I also want to introduce some new common consonants to test.

Good candidates:
- STARS – but S is already in slot 4 (invalid per feedback).
- CRASH – has C, H (new letters) and moves R out of slot 2, A out of slot 1, S out of slot 4.
- TRASH – same idea as CRASH, with T.
- DRANK – uses D, N, K (new letters) and positions A, R, S differently.

I'll go with TRASH: it has T and H (new), moves A to slot 3, R to slot 2, S to slot 5 (all valid per feedback).

Guess 2: TRASH -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A (not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (not in positions 2 or 2 again, so not position 2)
- S (not in positions 4 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, E, H

So the secret word must contain A, R, and S exactly once each, and two other letters that are not O, E, or H.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3  

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, S, O, E, H). Common remaining consonants include L, N, D, C, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, R, S in valid spots while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “CRANE” but E is excluded. “DRANK” has H excluded. “SCARF” has F (valid) and positions:
- S in 1 (valid)
- C new
- A in 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3)

“SCARS” repeats S. “SCRAM” has M new and positions:
- S 1 (ok)
- C new
- A 3 (invalid)

“SCRAN” has N new and positions:
- S 1 (ok)
- C new
- R 3 (ok)
- A 4 (ok)
- N new

This seems valid: S, C, R, A, N with no conflicts.

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word:
- S – in position 1 (✓)
- A – in the word, and now known to be in position 4 (✓)
- R – in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from earlier rounds), and NOT in position 3 (new), so R must be in position 5.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- O, E, H, C, N

So the secret word looks like:
S _ _ A R

We need two more distinct letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, S, O, E, C, H, N. Common remaining consonants include D, L, M, P, T, etc.

Possible combinations:
- S D L A R → SDLAR (invalid, not a word)
- S L D A R → SL DAR (invalid)
- S P L A R → SPLAR (invalid)
- S L M A R → SLMAR (invalid)
- S T A A R – invalid (A repeated)
- S T R A R – R already used
- S T A L R – invalid
- S T A M R – invalid
- S T A P R – invalid
- S T A D R – invalid

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter English words matching S _ _ A R pattern:
- S M A R T – but T is in position 5 already (from TRASH feedback T(-) meaning T is in word but not position 1). Could T be in position 2? Let’s check:
  - S T _ A R – the blank must be a consonant not yet used. From remaining letters: D, L, M, P, T, etc. T is already used in position 2? No, T is only known to not be in position 1. So T could be in position 2.
  - S T A A R – invalid (A repeated)
  - S T A L R – invalid word
  - S T A M R – invalid
  - S T A P R – invalid
  - S T A D R – invalid

Actually, the only common valid word fitting S _ _ A R is:
- S M A R T – positions: S(1), M(2), A(4), R(5), T(3). This uses T in position 3, which is allowed since T was only excluded from position 1.

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) – matches position 1
- M – new letter
- A(✓) – matches position 4
- R – must be in position 5 (only remaining spot)
- T – new letter, and T was only excluded from position 1, so position 3 is fine.

This seems correct.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word (and their positions):
- S is in position 1 (from SCRAN and confirmed by SMART).
- A is in position 4 (from SCRAN and confirmed by SMART).

Letters that are definitely in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4; must be in 5)
- T (cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5; must be in 2 or 3)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- O, E, H, C, N, M

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ A _

And we know:
- Position 5 must be R (only remaining spot for R).
- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with T and one other unused letter, since T must be in 2 or 3.

The remaining unused letters (excluding A, S, R, O, E, H, C, N, M) include D, L, P, etc.

Possible words:
- S T _ A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used. From remaining: D, L, P, etc.
  - S T D A R → not a valid word
  - S T L A R → ""STLAR"" – not valid
  - S T P A R → ""STPAR"" – not valid
- S _ T A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used, and T would be in position 2
  - S _ T A R → the blank must be a letter not yet used. From remaining: D, L, P, etc.
  - S D T A R → ""SDTAR"" – not valid
  - S L T A R → ""SL TAR"" – not valid
  - S P T A R → ""SPTAR"" – not valid

Wait, let’s list valid English words that fit S _ _ A R:
- S T A R _ – no, we need 5 letters
- S T _ A R – valid words:
  - S T A R K – but K not yet used
  - S T A R T – T repeated
  - S T A R S – S repeated
  - S T A R E – E excluded
  - S T A R R – R repeated
  - S T A R Y – Y not yet used

""STARY"" is not a common word. Actually, the only common valid word is:
- S T A R K – positions: S(1), T(2), A(4), R(5), K(3)

This fits all constraints:
- S in 1, A in 4, R in 5
- T in 2
- K is new and not excluded

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) – position 1
- T – must be in 2 or 3, here in 2 (allowed)
- A(✓) – position 4
- R – must be in 5 (only spot left)
- K – new letter, not excluded

This seems correct.

Let’s update what we now know after five guesses.

1. Positions we are certain about:
   - Position 1: S (✓ from SCRAN and SMART and STARK)
   - Position 4: A (✓ from SCRAN and SMART and STARK)

2. Letters that must appear in the word (but positions still unknown):
   - R (must be in the word; cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 – every spot has been ruled out)
   - T (must be in the word; cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5)

   Wait: in STARK, R is in position 5 and got “-”, meaning R is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   Earlier we had:
   - From TRASH: R not in position 2
   - From SCRAN: R not in position 3
   - From SMART: R not in position 4
   - From STARK: R not in position 5
   That leaves no legal position for R.  
   This contradiction shows my earlier deduction was wrong.

Let me re-examine:

From SCRAN: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
From SMART: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 4.
From STARK: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So R can only be in position 2.

Similarly, T:
- From TRASH: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- From STARK: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Thus T must be in position 3.

Current pattern:
S _ T A _

Letters still needed: one more letter for position 2, must be unused so far.
Excluded letters: O, E, H, C, N, M, K
Remaining common consonants: D, L, P, etc.

Valid 5-letter words matching S _ T A _:
- S L T A _ – no common word
- S P T A _ – no
- S D T A _ – no
- S _ T A R – only possible is S D T A R (invalid), S L T A R (invalid), S P T A R (invalid)

Wait, the only valid English word fitting S _ T A _ is:
S L A T E – but E is excluded
S P A T A – invalid
S C T A R – C excluded
S W T A R – W not yet used, but “SWTAR” not a word
S D T A R – invalid

Actually, the correct pattern is S _ T A R because R must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).

So word must be S R T A _ – but that repeats T and A.

Wait, let me re-tabulate:

Pattern: S _ _ A _
Positions left: 2, 3, 5
Letters still needed: R (must be in 2), T (must be in 3), and one more letter for position 5 – but we’ve already placed R and T.

Thus the only possible arrangement is:
S R T A _

But we need a 5-letter word. The only valid English word is:
S R T A N – but N is excluded
S R T A K – K excluded
S R T A D – invalid
S R T A L – invalid

This suggests the only remaining possibility is:
S R T A R – invalid (R repeated)

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine R placement.

Re-evaluate R positions:
- From AROSE: R not in position 2
- From TRASH: R not in position 2
- From SCRAN: R not in position 3
- From SMART: R not in position 4
- From STARK: R not in position 5

Thus R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 – only position 1 is left, but position 1 is S.

This is impossible – the only resolution is that I misread feedback. Let me recheck:

From SCRAN: S(✓) C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) → R is in word, not in position 3
From SMART: S(✓) M(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) → R is in word, not in position 4
From STARK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) R(-) K(x) → R is in word, not in position 5

Thus R must be in position 2.

Similarly, T:
- From TRASH: T(-) → T in word, not in position 1
- From STARK: T(-) → T in word, not in position 2
Thus T must be in position 3 or 4 or 5. But position 4 is A, so T must be in position 3 or 5.

But we have:
S _ _ A _

With R fixed at position 2:
S R _ A _

Then T must be in position 3 or 5. Position 5 must be a letter not yet used, and T must be placed.

Possible words:
- S R T A _ → need a 5th letter, but position 5 must be filled. Only possible is S R T A N – N excluded
- S R _ A T → positions: S(1), R(2), _ (3), A(4), T(5)

Letters left for position 3: unused letters excluding A, S, R, T, O, E, H, C, N, M, K → remaining include D, L, P, etc.

Valid words:
- S R D A T – invalid
- S R L A T – invalid
- S R P A T – invalid

Actually, the correct word must be S R _ A T with a valid letter in position 3. The only common valid word is:
S R I A T – but I not yet used
S R U A T – invalid
S R L A T – invalid

Wait, the word must be S R _ A T. The only valid English word is:
S R I A T – but ""SRIAT"" is not a word
S R U A T – no
S R O A T – O excluded
S R E A T – E excluded

This indicates the only possible arrangement is:
S R _ A T with _ being a valid letter. The correct word is ""SRAFT"" – but F not yet used.

But let me check valid 5-letter words starting with S R _ A T – actually, none exist.

Thus the only remaining possibility is that T is in position 3 and R is in position 2, forming S R T A _, but we need a 5-letter word. The correct word must be ""S R T A N"" – but N excluded.

This suggests the only valid word left is ""S R I A T"" – but this is not valid.

Upon reviewing, the only valid English word that fits all constraints is ""S R I A T"" – but this is invalid.

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine:

Actually, the correct arrangement is:
S _ _ A R

Because R must be in position 5 (only spot left), T must be in position 2 or 3, and we need a letter for the remaining spot.

Thus:
S T _ A R – but T cannot be in position 2 (from STARK feedback T(-) means T not in position 2)
Thus T must be in position 3, and position 2 must be a new letter.

Pattern: S _ T A R

Letters left for position 2: unused letters excluding A, S, T, O, E, H, C, N, M, K → D, L, P, etc.

Valid words:
- S D T A R – invalid
- S L T A R – invalid
- S P T A R – invalid

The only valid English word is ""S L A T E"" – but E excluded.

This indicates the only possible word left is ""S W T A R"" – but ""SWTAR"" is not a word.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be ""S P A R K"" – but K excluded.

This shows the only possible arrangement is ""S L A R T"" – but this is invalid.

After careful reconsideration, the correct word must be ""S P A R T"" – but P and T placements must satisfy constraints.

Let me list all possible valid 5-letter words starting with S and containing A at 4 and R at 5:
S _ _ A R

Valid words:
- S C A R F – C excluded, F new
- S P A R K – K excluded
- S L A R T – invalid
- S D A R T – invalid
- S M A R T – M excluded
- S T A R K – K excluded
- S W A R P – P new, W new

""SWARP"" is not a standard word.

The only valid remaining word is ""S P A R T"" – positions:
S(1), P(2), A(4), R(5), T(3)

This fits all constraints:
- S in 1
- A in 4
- R in 5
- T in 3
- P in 2 (new letter)

Thus the correct guess is ""SPART"".
</think>

Based on all constraints, the only remaining valid word is:

<guess>SPART</guess>",SPART,"Let’s update what we now know after five guesses.

1. Positions we are certain about:
   - Position 1: S (✓ from SCRAN and SMART and STARK)
   - Position 4: A (✓ from SCRAN and SMART and STARK)

2. Letters that must appear in the word (but positions still unknown):
   - R (must be in the word; cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 – every spot has been ruled out)
   - T (must be in the word; cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5)

   Wait: in STARK, R is in position 5 and got “-”, meaning R is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   Earlier we had:
   - From TRASH: R not in position 2
   - From SCRAN: R not in position 3
   - From SMART: R not in position 4
   - From STARK: R not in position 5
   That leaves no legal position for R.  
   This contradiction shows my earlier deduction was wrong.

Let me re-examine:

From SCRAN: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
From SMART: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 4.
From STARK: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So R can only be in position 2.

Similarly, T:
- From TRASH: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- From STARK: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Thus T must be in position 3.

Current pattern:
S _ T A _

Letters still needed: one more letter for position 2, must be unused so far.
Excluded letters: O, E, H, C, N, M, K
Remaining common consonants: D, L, P, etc.

Valid 5-letter words matching S _ T A _:
- S L T A _ – no common word
- S P T A _ – no
- S D T A _ – no
- S _ T A R – only possible is S D T A R (invalid), S L T A R (invalid), S P T A R (invalid)

Wait, the only valid English word fitting S _ T A _ is:
S L A T E – but E is excluded
S P A T A – invalid
S C T A R – C excluded
S W T A R – W not yet used, but “SWTAR” not a word
S D T A R – invalid

Actually, the correct pattern is S _ T A R because R must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).

So word must be S R T A _ – but that repeats T and A.

Wait, let me re-tabulate:

Pattern: S _ _ A _
Positions left: 2, 3, 5
Letters still needed: R (must be in 2), T (must be in 3), and one more letter for position 5 – but we’ve already placed R and T.

Thus the only possible arrangement is:
S R T A _

But we need a 5-letter word. The only valid English word is:
S R T A N – but N is excluded
S R T A K – K excluded
S R T A D – invalid
S R T A L – invalid

This suggests the only remaining possibility is:
S R T A R – invalid (R repeated)

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine R placement.

Re-evaluate R positions:
- From AROSE: R not in position 2
- From TRASH: R not in position 2
- From SCRAN: R not in position 3
- From SMART: R not in position 4
- From STARK: R not in position 5

Thus R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 – only position 1 is left, but position 1 is S.

This is impossible – the only resolution is that I misread feedback. Let me recheck:

From SCRAN: S(✓) C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) → R is in word, not in position 3
From SMART: S(✓) M(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) → R is in word, not in position 4
From STARK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) R(-) K(x) → R is in word, not in position 5

Thus R must be in position 2.

Similarly, T:
- From TRASH: T(-) → T in word, not in position 1
- From STARK: T(-) → T in word, not in position 2
Thus T must be in position 3 or 4 or 5. But position 4 is A, so T must be in position 3 or 5.

But we have:
S _ _ A _

With R fixed at position 2:
S R _ A _

Then T must be in position 3 or 5. Position 5 must be a letter not yet used, and T must be placed.

Possible words:
- S R T A _ → need a 5th letter, but position 5 must be filled. Only possible is S R T A N – N excluded
- S R _ A T → positions: S(1), R(2), _ (3), A(4), T(5)

Letters left for position 3: unused letters excluding A, S, R, T, O, E, H, C, N, M, K → remaining include D, L, P, etc.

Valid words:
- S R D A T – invalid
- S R L A T – invalid
- S R P A T – invalid

Actually, the correct word must be S R _ A T with a valid letter in position 3. The only common valid word is:
S R I A T – but I not yet used
S R U A T – invalid
S R L A T – invalid

Wait, the word must be S R _ A T. The only valid English word is:
S R I A T – but ""SRIAT"" is not a word
S R U A T – no
S R O A T – O excluded
S R E A T – E excluded

This indicates the only possible arrangement is:
S R _ A T with _ being a valid letter. The correct word is ""SRAFT"" – but F not yet used.

But let me check valid 5-letter words starting with S R _ A T – actually, none exist.

Thus the only remaining possibility is that T is in position 3 and R is in position 2, forming S R T A _, but we need a 5-letter word. The correct word must be ""S R T A N"" – but N excluded.

This suggests the only valid word left is ""S R I A T"" – but this is not valid.

Upon reviewing, the only valid English word that fits all constraints is ""S R I A T"" – but this is invalid.

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine:

Actually, the correct arrangement is:
S _ _ A R

Because R must be in position 5 (only spot left), T must be in position 2 or 3, and we need a letter for the remaining spot.

Thus:
S T _ A R – but T cannot be in position 2 (from STARK feedback T(-) means T not in position 2)
Thus T must be in position 3, and position 2 must be a new letter.

Pattern: S _ T A R

Letters left for position 2: unused letters excluding A, S, T, O, E, H, C, N, M, K → D, L, P, etc.

Valid words:
- S D T A R – invalid
- S L T A R – invalid
- S P T A R – invalid

The only valid English word is ""S L A T E"" – but E excluded.

This indicates the only possible word left is ""S W T A R"" – but ""SWTAR"" is not a word.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be ""S P A R K"" – but K excluded.

This shows the only possible arrangement is ""S L A R T"" – but this is invalid.

After careful reconsideration, the correct word must be ""S P A R T"" – but P and T placements must satisfy constraints.

Let me list all possible valid 5-letter words starting with S and containing A at 4 and R at 5:
S _ _ A R

Valid words:
- S C A R F – C excluded, F new
- S P A R K – K excluded
- S L A R T – invalid
- S D A R T – invalid
- S M A R T – M excluded
- S T A R K – K excluded
- S W A R P – P new, W new

""SWARP"" is not a standard word.

The only valid remaining word is ""S P A R T"" – positions:
S(1), P(2), A(4), R(5), T(3)

This fits all constraints:
- S in 1
- A in 4
- R in 5
- T in 3
- P in 2 (new letter)

Thus the correct guess is ""SPART"".Based on all constraints, the only remaining valid word is:",Guess 6: SPART -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) A(-) R(-) T(-),FAIL
