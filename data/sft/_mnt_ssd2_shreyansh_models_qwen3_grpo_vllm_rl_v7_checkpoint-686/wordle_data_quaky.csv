For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word. Let me go with AROSE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Letters we can now eliminate: R, O, S, E.
Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere other than position 1).

Next, I want to test new consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, U, and Y (sometimes). Common consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not first).
2. Introduce new letters we haven't tested yet.
3. Avoid any of R, O, S, E.

Let's try ""TAINT"":
- T and N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- The word is valid and follows all constraints.

But wait, ""TAINT"" has T and N which might be good, but let me think of something better that covers more new letters.

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but this has L, N, T, P and A in position 2. This seems good.

But ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is allowed (since A was only ruled out of position 1). It introduces P, L, N, T - all new letters.

I think ""PLANT"" is a solid second guess.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H

2. Positions we have learned:
   - A is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (because CATCH gave A(-) for position 3).
   - A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE).
   - A is NOT in position 2 (from CATCH).

3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

4. The remaining letters (not yet eliminated) are:
   A, B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A in position 4 or 5.
   - Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
   - _ _ _ A _

Let's look for common words fitting these patterns. The letter A in position 4 is more common, so let's focus there.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word. Let me go with AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Letters we can now eliminate: R, O, S, E.
Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere other than position 1).

Next, I want to test new consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, U, and Y (sometimes). Common consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not first).
2. Introduce new letters we haven't tested yet.
3. Avoid any of R, O, S, E.

Let's try ""TAINT"":
- T and N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- The word is valid and follows all constraints.

But wait, ""TAINT"" has T and N which might be good, but let me think of something better that covers more new letters.

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but this has L, N, T, P and A in position 2. This seems good.

But ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is allowed (since A was only ruled out of position 1). It introduces P, L, N, T - all new letters.

I think ""PLANT"" is a solid second guess.

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word contains the letter A and the letter T.
2. A is in the 3rd position (from Guess 2).
3. The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, N are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ _ with T somewhere in the remaining four positions.

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones):  
A (already placed in position 3)  
T (must be placed in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
Plus any other letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Has T in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- T _ A _ _
- _ T A _ _
- _ _ A T _
- _ _ A _ T

Let’s pick a word that uses fresh, common consonants to narrow things down quickly.  
A good candidate is “CATCH”:
- C and H are new letters.
- T is in position 4 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- It satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, I’ll guess CATCH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word. Let me go with AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Letters we can now eliminate: R, O, S, E.
Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere other than position 1).

Next, I want to test new consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, U, and Y (sometimes). Common consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not first).
2. Introduce new letters we haven't tested yet.
3. Avoid any of R, O, S, E.

Let's try ""TAINT"":
- T and N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- The word is valid and follows all constraints.

But wait, ""TAINT"" has T and N which might be good, but let me think of something better that covers more new letters.

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but this has L, N, T, P and A in position 2. This seems good.

But ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is allowed (since A was only ruled out of position 1). It introduces P, L, N, T - all new letters.

I think ""PLANT"" is a solid second guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word contains the letter A and the letter T.
2. A is in the 3rd position (from Guess 2).
3. The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, N are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ _ with T somewhere in the remaining four positions.

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones):  
A (already placed in position 3)  
T (must be placed in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
Plus any other letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Has T in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- T _ A _ _
- _ T A _ _
- _ _ A T _
- _ _ A _ T

Let’s pick a word that uses fresh, common consonants to narrow things down quickly.  
A good candidate is “CATCH”:
- C and H are new letters.
- T is in position 4 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- It satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, I’ll guess CATCH.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H

2. Positions we have learned:
   - A is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (because CATCH gave A(-) for position 3).
   - A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE).
   - A is NOT in position 2 (from CATCH).

3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

4. The remaining letters (not yet eliminated) are:
   A, B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A in position 4 or 5.
   - Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
   - _ _ _ A _
   - _ _ _ _ A

Let's look for common words fitting these patterns. The letter A in position 4 is more common, so let's focus there.

Possible candidates:
   - BAGEL - but E is eliminated.
   - BADLY - L is eliminated.
   - FATED - E, T are eliminated.
   - MADLY - L is eliminated.
   - VAPED - E, P are eliminated.
   - WAGED - E, G is ok but D is ok, but E is eliminated.
   - YACHT - T, H are eliminated.
   - DUMMY - no A in position 4.
   - GUMMY - no A in position 4.
   - JAMMY - J, M, Y are ok, but A is in position 2 which is not allowed.
   - MUMMY - no A in position 4.
   - VAMPS - S, P are eliminated.
   - VAMIC - C is eliminated.
   - VAMBO - O is eliminated.
   - VAMPS - P, S eliminated.
   - VAMUD - U, D are ok, but A is in position 2 which is not allowed.
   - VAMMY - M, Y are ok, but A is in position 2 which is not allowed.
   - VANDY - N is eliminated.
   - VAPID - P is eliminated.
   - VARKY - R is eliminated.
   - VASTY - S is eliminated.
   - VAXEN - E, N are eliminated.
   - VAXIL - L is eliminated.
   - VAXIS - S is eliminated.
   - VAXOM - O is eliminated.
   - VAXOR - R is eliminated.
   - VAXOT - T is eliminated.
   - VAXYS - S is eliminated.
   - VAYAN - N is eliminated.
   - VAYAR - R is eliminated.
   - VAYAS - S is eliminated.
   - VAYED - E is eliminated.
   - VAYER - R is eliminated.
   - VAYS - too short.
   - VAYT - too short.
   - VAZY - Y is ok, but A is in position 2 which is not allowed.

Hmm, most common words seem to have eliminated letters. Let's try A in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ _ A

Possible candidates:
   - BURQA - R, U, Q are ok, but R is eliminated.
   - DUBIA - U, D, I are ok, but A is in position 5 which is allowed.
   - FUGIA - F, U, G, I are ok, A in position 5.
   - JUDIA - J, U, D, I are ok, A in position 5.
   - MUDIA - M, U, D, I are ok, A in position 5.
   - VUGIA - V, U, G, I are ok, A in position 5.
   - WUGIA - W, U, G, I are ok, A in position 5.
   - YUGIA - Y, U, G, I are ok, A in position 5.

""DUBIA"" seems like a good candidate - it's a valid word (a political term), uses only allowed letters, and places A in position 5.

From the five rounds we now know:

1. Eliminated letters (all that have shown “x”):  
   R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, H, D, B, I, J, M

2. Fixed positions:  
   - U is in position 2 (✓).  
   - K is in the word and is in position 4 (from JUMKA: K(✓)).

3. A must be in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is now taken by K, so A must be in position 5.

4. Pattern so far:  
   _ U _ K A

5. Remaining usable letters (not yet eliminated):  
   A (now fixed in 5), U (fixed in 2), K (fixed in 4), plus the still-allowed consonants: F, G, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

6. We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ U _ K A.

Possible candidates:  
   - FUGKA – not a word.  
   - VUGKA – not a word.  
   - WUKKA – not a word.  
   - YUKKA – valid (a type of bread or slang for “yuk”).  
   - ZUKKA – not standard.

The only valid word is YUKKA.

Check constraints:  
- U in 2, K in 4, A in 5 (all allowed).  
- Letters Y, U, K, K, A are all not in the eliminated set.  
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, YUKKA is the correct next guess.
