For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test multiple positions at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words with distinct letters:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers 5 very common letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - another strong candidate
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - similar to SLATE but different order

I'll go with SLATE as it tests S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most frequent letters in English.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the 5th position.
2. Avoid S, L, A, T.
3. Use new common letters to test remaining positions.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A strong second guess would test several of these in the first four positions while keeping E fixed.  
Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is excluded)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – uses C, R, O, N
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – uses P, R, O, N
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E) – uses B, R, I, N

I'll choose CRONE to test C, R, O, N in positions 1-4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test multiple positions at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words with distinct letters:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers 5 very common letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - another strong candidate
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - similar to SLATE but different order

I'll go with SLATE as it tests S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most frequent letters in English.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the 5th position.
2. Avoid S, L, A, T.
3. Use new common letters to test remaining positions.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A strong second guess would test several of these in the first four positions while keeping E fixed.  
Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is excluded)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – uses C, R, O, N
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – uses P, R, O, N
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E) – uses B, R, I, N

I'll choose CRONE to test C, R, O, N in positions 1-4.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is still fixed in position 5.
   - C, R, N are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  
Letters known to be absent: S, L, A, T, C, R, N  
Letters known to be present: O (but not in position 3)

Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.

I need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O somewhere except position 3.
- Uses new letters not yet tested.

Good candidates:
- DOGIE (O in position 2, tests D, G, I)
- MOXIE (O in position 2, tests M, X, I)
- FOGIE (O in position 2, tests F, G, I)
- POUCH (but doesn’t end with E)
- HUMID (doesn’t end with E)
- BOGIE (O in position 2, tests B, G, I)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test multiple positions at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words with distinct letters:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers 5 very common letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - another strong candidate
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - similar to SLATE but different order

I'll go with SLATE as it tests S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most frequent letters in English.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the 5th position.
2. Avoid S, L, A, T.
3. Use new common letters to test remaining positions.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A strong second guess would test several of these in the first four positions while keeping E fixed.  
Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is excluded)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – uses C, R, O, N
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – uses P, R, O, N

   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  
Letters known to be absent: S, L, A, T, C, R, N  
Letters known to be present: O (but not in position 3)

Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.

I need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O somewhere except position 3.
- Uses new letters not yet tested.

Good candidates:
- DOGIE (O in position 2, tests D, G, I)
- MOXIE (O in position 2, tests M, X, I)
- FOGIE (O in position 2, tests F, G, I)
- POUCH (but doesn’t end with E)
- HUMID (doesn’t end with E)
- BOGIE (O in position 2, tests B, G, I)

I’ll choose FOGIE because it tests F, G, I and places O in position 2.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: FOGIE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) G(x) I(✓) E(✓)

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E (position 5).
   - Letters S, L, A, T are NOT in the word.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - C, R, N are NOT in the word.

3. FOGIE → F(x) O(✓) G(x) I(✓) E(✓)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - I is in the word and in position 4.
   - F, G are NOT in the word.

Current known pattern: _ O _ I E

Letters known to be absent: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, F, G

Remaining common letters to test: D, H, K, M, P, U, B, V, W, Y

I need a 5-letter word fitting _ O _ I E using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- DOPIE (D, P)
- HOPIE (H, P)
- MOPIE (M, P)
- BOVIE (B, V) – but V hasn’t been tested
- WODIE (W, D) – but W hasn’t been tested

Testing D and P next seems good. I’ll pick DOPIE.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: D O _ I E (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 fixed)
- Letters known to be absent: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, F, G, P
- Position 3 is the only unknown; it must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters not yet tested or ruled out:
B, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word of the form D O _ I E using one of these letters in the third position.

Possible candidates:
- DOBIE (B)
- DOHIE (H)
- DOKIE (K)
- DOMIE (M)
- DOUIE (U)
- DOVIE (V)
- Dowie (W)
- DOYIE (Y)

All of these are valid English words (though ""dowie"" is less common). The most common-sounding choice is ""DOBIE"" (a proper noun/name), but ""DOHIE"" or ""DOMIE"" are also plausible. ""DOHIE"" is slightly more common as a diminutive form.

I’ll go with DOHIE.
