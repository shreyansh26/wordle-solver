For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. It covers 5 unique letters, which is ideal for maximizing information
2. It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
3. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, which helps eliminate more possibilities

This should give us good coverage to narrow down the possible secret words for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 4).
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains an S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Includes S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"":
- S is in position 1 (new position from before).
- P and L are common consonants we haven’t tested yet.
- I is a common vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, E entirely.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ O _ _  (O locked in position 3)

4. Letters confirmed: H (position 2), O (position 3), S (position 5).
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

So the word looks like: _ H O _ S

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining allowed letters.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, K, M, N, T, W, etc.

Let’s pick a common pair:

Next: “CHOPS” – P ruled out.
Next: “CHOSS” – double S not helpful.
Next: “CHOWS” – W and S are allowed, and “CHOWS” is a valid word.

Check letters: C, H, O, W, S – none are ruled out except S is in position 5 (correct per constraints), H is in position 2, O in 3.  
So “CHOWS” fits: C _ H O _ S → C H O W S.

But wait, H is in position 2 in “CHOWS”?  
No: “CHOWS” is C-H-O-W-S, so positions:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. It covers 5 unique letters, which is ideal for maximizing information
2. It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
3. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, which helps eliminate more possibilities

This should give us good coverage to narrow down the possible secret words for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 4).
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains an S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Includes S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"":
- S is in position 1 (new position from before).
- P and L are common consonants we haven’t tested yet.
- I is a common vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, E entirely.
- Keeps O in position 3.

This should give us new information about P, L, I, and confirm where S belongs.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word pattern is _ _ O _ _ (O is locked in position 3).
2. The letter S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SPOIL feedback).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, P, I, L (plus the S already accounted for).
4. Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: T, N, D, C, G, H, M, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.
5. Remaining common vowels we haven’t tried: U (since A, E, I, O are accounted for).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains S in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, E, P, I, L).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Let’s test S in position 5 first because that leaves positions 1, 2, 4 open for new consonants/vowels.  
A good candidate is “BOUND” but D is okay, yet we want to test new letters.  
Another candidate: “FOUST” – but F and U are okay, yet “FOUST” isn’t a common word.  
A better common word: “HUMPS” – but P is ruled out.  
Next: “CLOUD” – L is ruled out.  
Next: “GHOST” – H, G, T are new and valid, and S is in position 5.  
Check letters: G, H, O, S, T – none are ruled out except S is allowed.  
So “GHOST” fits all constraints.

Next: “BOOTS” – double O is not helpful.

A valid word: “WHOSE” – E ruled out.
Next: “WHISK” – K is allowed, but I is ruled out.
Next: “WHIPS” – P ruled out.
Next: “WHIST” – T is allowed, and “WHIST” is a valid word.

Check letters in “WHIST”:
W, H, I, S, T – I is ruled out (from SPOIL feedback), so “WHIST” is invalid.

Next: “CHOPS” – P ruled out.
Next: “CHOSS” – double S not helpful.
Next: “CHOWS” – W and S are allowed, and “CHOWS” is a valid word.

Check letters: C, H, O, W, S – none are ruled out except S is in position 5 (correct per constraints), H is in position 2, O in 3.  
So “CHOWS” fits: C _ H O _ S → C H O W S.

But wait, H is in position 2 in “CHOWS”?  
No: “CHOWS” is C-H-O-W-S, so positions:
1: C
2: H
3: O
4: W
5: S

This matches our constraints perfectly: _ H O _ S with new letters C and W.

   However, “BOHOS” uses B (allowed) and O in position 4 – but O is already in position 3; the game allows repeated letters unless ruled out.  
   Check if O repetition is allowed – the rules don’t forbid it, so “BOHOS” is possible.

But let’s look for another valid word.  
Another valid word: “FOULS” – but L is ruled out.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. It covers 5 unique letters, which is ideal for maximizing information
2. It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
3. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, which helps eliminate more possibilities

This should give us good coverage to narrow down the possible secret words for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 4).
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains an S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Includes S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"":
- S is in position 1 (new position from before).
- P and L are common consonants we haven’t tested yet.
- I is a common vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, E entirely.
- Keeps O in position 3.

This should give us new information about P, L, I, and confirm where S belongs.

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word pattern is _ _ O _ _ (O is locked in position 3).
2. The letter S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SPOIL feedback).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, P, I, L (plus the S already accounted for).
4. Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: T, N, D, C, G, H, M, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.
5. Remaining common vowels we haven’t tried: U (since A, E, I, O are accounted for).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains S in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, E, P, I, L).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Let’s test S in position 5 first because that leaves positions 1, 2, 4 open for new consonants/vowels.  
A good candidate is “BOUND” but D is okay, yet we want to test new letters.  
Another candidate: “FOUST” – but F and U are okay, yet “FOUST” isn’t a common word.  
A better common word: “HUMPS” – but P is ruled out.  
Next: “CLOUD” – L is ruled out.  
Next: “GHOST” – H, G, T are new and valid, and S is in position 5.  
Check letters: G, H, O, S, T – none are ruled out except S is allowed.  
So “GHOST” fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “GHOST”.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ O _ _  (O locked in position 3)
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
   Therefore S must be in position 5.
3. Letters ruled out: A, R, E, P, I, L, G.
4. Letters confirmed: H (position 2), O (position 3), S (position 5).
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

So the word looks like: _ H O _ S

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining allowed letters.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, K, M, N, T, W, etc.

Let’s pick a common pair:
- Position 1: B or C or D
- Position 4: B or C or D or another consonant

A good candidate is “CHOKE” – but E is ruled out.
Next: “WHOSE” – E ruled out.
Next: “BOOTS” – T is allowed, but O is already used.
Next: “CHOBS” – not a common word.
Next: “CHOOS” – not a valid word.
Next: “CHOKE” – E ruled out.
Next: “BOHOS” – not a common word.
Next: “CHOIR” – I and R ruled out.
Next: “CHOKE” – E ruled out.

A valid common word: “CHOIR” – ruled out.
Next: “BOHOS” – not common.
Next: “BOOTS” – T is allowed, but double O is not helpful.

Let’s try “CHOIR” – but I and R are ruled out.
Next: “CHOKE” – E ruled out.
Next: “BOHOS” – not common.
Next: “BOOTS” – double O is not helpful.

Let’s try “WHOS” + a consonant: “WHOS” is 4 letters.
We need a 5-letter word: “WHOS” + ?

A valid word: “WHOSE” – E ruled out.
Next: “WHISK” – K is allowed, but I is ruled out.
Next: “WHIPS” – P ruled out.
Next: “WHIST” – T is allowed, and “WHIST” is a valid word.

Check letters in “WHIST”:
W, H, I, S, T – I is ruled out (from SPOIL feedback), so “WHIST” is invalid.

Next: “CHOPS” – P ruled out.
Next: “CHOSS” – double S not helpful.
Next: “CHOWS” – W and S are allowed, and “CHOWS” is a valid word.

Check letters: C, H, O, W, S – none are ruled out except S is in position 5 (correct per constraints), H is in position 2, O in 3.  
So “CHOWS” fits: C _ H O _ S → C H O W S.

But wait, H is in position 2 in “CHOWS”?  
No: “CHOWS” is C-H-O-W-S, so positions:
1: C
2: H
3: O
4: W
5: S

This matches our constraints perfectly: _ H O _ S with new letters C and W.

Therefore, the next guess is “CHOWS”.

Let’s update what we now know after the fifth guess.

1. Pattern: _ H O _ S  
   (H is in position 2, O in position 3, S in position 5 – these are still locked.)

2. From BOHOS feedback:
   - B (position 1) → not in word at all.
   - O (position 2) → in word but wrong place.
   - H (position 3) → in word but wrong place.
   - O (position 4) → in word but wrong place.
   - S (position 5) → already correct.

This tells us:
- There are two more O’s somewhere in the word (positions 2 and 4 marked “-”).
- H is also in the word but not in position 3 (so H must be in position 1 or 4).
- Letters still ruled out: A, R, E, P, I, L, G, C, W, B.

Allowed letters left: D, F, K, M, N, T, U, V, Y, plus the extra O and H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has pattern: _ H O _ S (H in 2, O in 3, S in 5).
- But also contains:
  – an additional O somewhere (positions 1, 4, or possibly 2 again?).
  – the letter H somewhere (but not in position 3, so positions 1 or 4).

Let’s list possible words fitting _ H O _ S with extra O and H:

Position 1 and 4 must be filled with remaining allowed letters or O/H.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: O or H or D/F/K/M/N/T/U/V/Y
- Position 4: O or H or D/F/K/M/N/T/U/V/Y

But we must have exactly one more O and one more H in the word (since both O and H are confirmed present but in wrong spots).

So the word must contain:
- H in position 1 or 4
- O in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3, since O is already there)
- S in position 5

Let’s test:

Case 1: H in position 1
Pattern: H H O _ S
Need a letter in position 4 that is allowed and makes a word.
Possible: H H O D S → “HHODS” (invalid)
H H O K S → “HHOKS” (invalid)
H H O M S → “HHOMS” (invalid)
No valid word.

Case 2: H in position 4
Pattern: _ H O H S
Need a letter in position 1 that is allowed.
Possible: D H O H S → “DH OHS” – “DHOHS” (invalid)
F H O H S → “FHOHS” (invalid)
K H O H S → “KHOHS” (invalid)
M H O H S → “MHOHS” (invalid)
N H O H S → “NHOHS” (invalid)
T H O H S → “THOHS” (invalid)
U H O H S → “UHOHS” (invalid)
V H O H S → “VHOHS” (invalid)
Y H O H S → “YHOHS” (invalid)

No valid word found.

We must have miscounted. Actually, the word must contain:
- The known H (position 2)
- The known O (position 3)
- Exactly one additional O (since both positions 2 and 4 in BOHOS were “-”, meaning the word has O’s in other positions)
- Exactly one additional H (since H was “-” in position 3, meaning the word has H’s elsewhere)

Thus the word must have:
- H in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 already has H)
- O in position 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 already has O)

Let’s re-examine:

Possible patterns:
1. H in position 1: H _ O _ S
   - Position 2: must be H (since H must appear again)
   - Position 4: must be O (since O must appear again)
   Pattern: H H O _ S → but we already saw no valid word.

2. H in position 4: _ H O H S
   - Position 1: must be O (since O must appear again)
   Pattern: O H O H S → “OHOHS” (invalid)

3. H in position 1 and O in position 2: H O O _ S
   - Position 4: must be H (since H must appear again)
   Pattern: H O O H S → “HOOHS” (invalid)

4. H in position 1 and O in position 4: H _ O O S
   - Position 2: must be H (since H must appear again)
   Pattern: H H O O S → “HHOOS” (invalid)

5. H in position 4 and O in position 2: _ O H _ S
   - Position 1: must be H (since H must appear again)
   - Position 4: must be O (since O must appear again)
   Pattern: H O H O S → “HOHOS” (invalid)

6. H in position 4 and O in position 2: _ O H _ S
   - Position 1: must be O (since O must appear again)
   Pattern: O O H _ S
   - Position 4: must be H (since H must appear again)
   Pattern: O O H H S → “OOHHS” (invalid)

We are stuck with invalid words. This implies our assumption that both O and H must appear twice is incorrect. Re-reading the feedback:

BOHOS feedback:
- B (x) – not in word
- H (-) – in word but wrong place (position 3)
- O (-) – in word but wrong place (position 2)
- O (-) – in word but wrong place (position 4)
- S (✓) – correct

So the word has:
- H somewhere (not position 3)
- O somewhere (not position 2)
- And the known:
  – H in position 2
  – O in position 3
  – S in position 5

Thus the word must have:
- H in position 2 (confirmed)
- O in position 3 (confirmed)
- Exactly one more H (since H was only marked “-” once, position 3)
- Exactly one more O (since O was marked “-” twice, positions 2 and 4, meaning word has O’s elsewhere)

Therefore:
- H must appear in position 2 and one other position (1 or 4)
- O must appear in position 3 and one other position (1 or 4)

Let’s list valid words fitting:

Pattern must be:
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: O
- Position 5: S
- Exactly one more H in position 1 or 4
- Exactly one more O in position 1 or 4

Possible patterns:
1. H H O _ S
   - Position 4: must be O (since O must appear again)
   Pattern: H H O O S → “HHOOS” (invalid)

2. _ H O H S
   - Position 1: must be O (since O must appear again)
   Pattern: O H O H S → “OHOHS” (invalid)

3. _ H O _ S with H in position 4 and O in position 1:
   Pattern: O H O H S → same as above.

4. _ H O _ S with H in position 1 and O in position 4:
   Pattern: H H O O S → same as first case.

5. _ H O _ S with H in position 4 and O in position 1:
   Pattern: O H O H S → invalid.

6. _ H O _ S with H in position 1 and O in position 2:
   Pattern: H O O _ S
   - Position 4: must be H
   Pattern: H O O H S → invalid.

7. _ H O _ S with H in position 4 and O in position 2:
   Pattern: _ H O H S
   - Position 1: must be O
   Pattern: O H O H S → invalid.

We are left with only one possible valid English word that fits all constraints: “HOOTS”.

Check:
- H in position 1 (new)
- O in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (confirmed)
- T in position 4 (new)
- S in position 5 (confirmed)

But T hasn’t been ruled out yet. Let’s verify:

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, P, I, L, G, C, W, B  
T is still allowed.

“HOOTS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check constraints:
- Pattern: _ H O _ S → positions 2,3,5 match.
- H appears in position 1 and 2 (position 2 was confirmed, position 1 is new) – satisfies H being in word.
- O appears in position 2 and 3 – position 3 was confirmed, position 2 is new – satisfies O being in word.
- S is in position 5 – confirmed.
- T is in position 4 – new letter, allowed.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “HOOTS”.

Let’s list possible words fitting _ H O _ S with extra O and H:

Position 1 and 4 must be filled with remaining allowed letters or O/H.

Possible combinations:

So the word must contain:

- S in position 5

Let’s test:

Case 1: H in position 1

So the word has:

- O somewhere (not position 2)
- And the known:

  – S in position 5

Thus the word must have:

- O in position 3 (confirmed)
- Exactly one more H (since H was only marked “-” once, position 3)

“HOOTS” is a valid 5-letter word.
