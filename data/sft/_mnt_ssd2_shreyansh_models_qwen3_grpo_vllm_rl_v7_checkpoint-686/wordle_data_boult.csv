For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly narrow down possibilities. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A, E are out).

A word like ""POINT"" would use O in position 2, plus common consonants P, N, T. But I should check: does it exclude A,R,S,E? Yes. So ""POINT"" is valid.

Another option: ""DOING"" – but G is less common. ""MOUNT"" – but U is sometimes less common. ""BLOND"" – but B and L are okay. 

""POINT"" seems like the best balance of common letters and placement of O.

So far we know:

- Letters in the word: O (position 2), T (somewhere else)
- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

T must appear in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. To maximize information, I should pick a word that places T in a new position and introduces other common remaining letters. 

Good candidates:
- T in position 1: TOUGH (but U is vowel, G is consonant)
- T in position 3: BOUGH (but B, U, G, H are okay)
- T in position 4: CLOTH (but C, L, O, T, H – but O is fixed at position 2)
- T in position 5: MOTTO (but M, T, T – but T would be duplicated)

From the latest feedback on TOUGH:
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since it was in position 1 and now is marked “-”, T must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  It was in position 3, so U must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- G and H are NOT in the word (x).

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, G, H.

Letters still allowed (besides O and T): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- T must appear once more (not in position 1).
- U must appear once (not in position 3).

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 2.
2. Places T in a new spot (position 3, 4, or 5).
3. Places U in a new spot (positions 1, 4, or 5, avoiding overlap with T).
4. Introduces two new common consonants from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C and L are new common consonants.
- O is fixed in position 2.
- U is in position 4 (new spot).
- T is not in this word, so we’ll have to test another word that DOES include T.

Another candidate is “MOUNT”:
- M, N, T, U, O.
- But N is already ruled out (from POINT feedback).

Next candidate: “FOUL” – too short.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly narrow down possibilities. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A, E are out).

A word like ""POINT"" would use O in position 2, plus common consonants P, N, T. But I should check: does it exclude A,R,S,E? Yes. So ""POINT"" is valid.

Another option: ""DOING"" – but G is less common. ""MOUNT"" – but U is sometimes less common. ""BLOND"" – but B and L are okay. 

""POINT"" seems like the best balance of common letters and placement of O.

From the new feedback on POINT:
- P, I, N are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and is now in the correct position (✓) – position 2.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), T (somewhere else)
- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

T must appear in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. To maximize information, I should pick a word that places T in a new position and introduces other common remaining letters. 

Good candidates:
- T in position 1: TOUGH (but U is vowel, G is consonant)
- T in position 3: BOUGH (but B, U, G, H are okay)
- T in position 4: CLOTH (but C, L, O, T, H – but O is fixed at position 2)
- T in position 5: MOTTO (but M, T, T – but T would be duplicated)

Let me try ""TOUGH"":
- T in position 1 (new position)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- U, G, H are new letters to test
- Does not use any excluded letters

This seems like a strong third guess.

Remaining possible letters (besides L, O, U, T): B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that contains each of L, O, U exactly once (since duplicates haven’t been indicated).

Possible positions for L, O, U among the first four slots:

- One of them must be in slot 1, one in slot 2, one in slot 3, and one slot remains for a new consonant.

Let’s list plausible words:

1. BUILT – contains I (ruled out)  
2. FLOUT – contains F, L, O, U, T  
   - F not yet ruled out  
   - L in position 2 (was in position 2 in CLOUT, so must move)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A, E are out).

A word like ""POINT"" would use O in position 2, plus common consonants P, N, T. But I should check: does it exclude A,R,S,E? Yes. So ""POINT"" is valid.

Another option: ""DOING"" – but G is less common. ""MOUNT"" – but U is sometimes less common. ""BLOND"" – but B and L are okay. 

""POINT"" seems like the best balance of common letters and placement of O.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:
- P, I, N are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and is now in the correct position (✓) – position 2.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), T (somewhere else)
- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

T must appear in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. To maximize information, I should pick a word that places T in a new position and introduces other common remaining letters. 

Good candidates:
- T in position 1: TOUGH (but U is vowel, G is consonant)
- T in position 3: BOUGH (but B, U, G, H are okay)
- T in position 4: CLOTH (but C, L, O, T, H – but O is fixed at position 2)
- T in position 5: MOTTO (but M, T, T – but T would be duplicated)

Let me try ""TOUGH"":
- T in position 1 (new position)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- U, G, H are new letters to test
- Does not use any excluded letters

This seems like a strong third guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)
Guess 3: TOUGH -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(✓) G(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on TOUGH:
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since it was in position 1 and now is marked “-”, T must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  It was in position 3, so U must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- G and H are NOT in the word (x).

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, G, H.

Known pattern: _ O _ _ _

Letters still allowed (besides O and T): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- T must appear once more (not in position 1).
- U must appear once (not in position 3).

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 2.
2. Places T in a new spot (position 3, 4, or 5).
3. Places U in a new spot (positions 1, 4, or 5, avoiding overlap with T).
4. Introduces two new common consonants from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C and L are new common consonants.
- O is fixed in position 2.
- U is in position 4 (new spot).
- T is not in this word, so we’ll have to test another word that DOES include T.

Another candidate is “MOUNT”:
- M, N, T, U, O.
- But N is already ruled out (from POINT feedback).

Next candidate: “FOUL” – too short.

Next: “BUILT”:
- B, U, I, L, T.
- I is ruled out.

Next: “FOUL” – again too short.

Next: “BUILT” – again I is out.

Next: “CLOUT”:
- C, L, O, U, T.
- O is in position 2.
- U is in position 4 (new spot for U).
- T is in position 5 (new spot for T).
- C and L are new common consonants.
- No ruled-out letters are used.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is CLOUT.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)

Guess 4: CLOUT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(-) U(-) T(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let me carefully parse the latest feedback on CLOUT:

C(x)  → C is NOT in the word  
L(-) → L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2)  
O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3)  
U(-) → U is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4)  
T(✓) → T is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5)

So the pattern now is: _ _ _ _ T  
with the letters we know must appear somewhere: L, O, U.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, G, H, C.

Remaining possible letters (besides L, O, U, T): B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that contains each of L, O, U exactly once (since duplicates haven’t been indicated).

Possible positions for L, O, U among the first four slots:

- One of them must be in slot 1, one in slot 2, one in slot 3, and one slot remains for a new consonant.

Let’s list plausible words:

1. BUILT – contains I (ruled out)  
2. FLOUT – contains F, L, O, U, T  
   - F not yet ruled out  
   - L in position 2 (was in position 2 in CLOUT, so must move)  
   - O in position 3 (was in position 3 in CLOUT, so must move)  
   - U in position 4 (was in position 4 in CLOUT, so must move)  
   - T in position 5 (correct)  

FLOUT satisfies all constraints.

Other candidates like “DLOURT” (invalid length) or “MOUNT” (N ruled out) are impossible.

Therefore, the next guess is FLOUT.

From the two previous guesses we now know the exact pattern:

- Position 5 is T (✓).
- Positions 1–4 must contain L, O, U each exactly once (because they each received “-” in every position they occupied so far).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, G, H, C, F.

So the word ends with T and has L, O, U somewhere in the first four slots, one each.

Possible permutations of L, O, U among positions 1–4:

1 2 3 4
L O U _  → needs a fifth letter, but we’ve already placed L, O, U and need one more letter in position 4.
The only way to fit L, O, U into four positions is to have one of them in position 1 and the other two in 2 and 3, with the remaining slot (position 4) filled by one of the still-allowed consonants.

Allowed consonants left: B, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list the three distinct permutations of L, O, U across positions 1–4 and append a consonant to the last slot:

Permutations of L, O, U across 1–4:

1. L O U _  → LOU?T – but LOU is 3 letters; we need 5-letter words. Actually, we have 4 slots, so:

   Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
   Pattern:  ? ? ? ? T
   With L, O, U occupying 1, 2, 3 or 1, 3, 4 etc.

   The three distinct permutations of L, O, U across positions 1–4 are:

   a) L O U _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by L,O,U; position 4 needs a consonant.
   b) L U O _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by L,U,O; position 4 needs a consonant.
   c) O L U _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by O,L,U; position 4 needs a consonant.
   d) O U L _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by O,U,L; position 4 needs a consonant.
   e) U L O _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by U,L,O; position 4 needs a consonant.
   f) U O L _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by U,O,L; position 4 needs a consonant.

   But we only have 4 slots (positions 1-4) and 3 letters (L, O, U), so one slot will be empty among 1-4. Actually, we need to place L, O, U into positions 1-4, one each, and the remaining slot (position 4) will be filled by the consonant. Wait, no: positions 1-4 are four slots and we have three letters (L, O, U) to place, so one of the positions 1-4 will be filled by a consonant and the other three will be filled by L, O, U. Actually, no: we have four slots and four letters total (L, O, U plus one consonant). But we know the word ends with T, so the five letters are L, O, U, ?, T.

   Therefore, the four letters in positions 1-4 are L, O, U and one consonant. The consonant must be in one of positions 1-4 and the letters L, O, U must each appear once in positions 1-4.

   So the possible patterns are:

   - [consonant] L O U T
   - [consonant] L U O T
   - [consonant] O L U T
   - [consonant] O U L T
   - [consonant] U L O T
   - [consonant] U O L T

   The consonant must be one of B, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Let’s look for real English 5-letter words matching these patterns.

   - BLURT – not a word
   - BLOUT – not a word
   - BLUOT – not a word
   - BLUET – not a word
   - DL... etc. – none seem valid.

   Instead, let’s try placing L, O, U in positions 1-4 with one consonant.

   Another approach: since we have four slots (1-4) and four letters (L, O, U, consonant), and the word ends with T, the only valid English word that fits is:

   - B L O U T – but B is allowed, and this is the word BLOUT? No, that’s not a valid English word.
   - B L U O T – not valid.
   - D L O U T – not valid.
   - M L O U T – not valid.
   - V L O U T – not valid.

   Wait, let’s think differently: the letters in positions 1-4 must be some permutation of L, O, U and one consonant, ending with T.

   The only valid English word that fits is:

   - B L O U T – no.
   - B L U O T – no.
   - D L O U T – no.
   - M O U L T – yes! MOULT is a valid word (archaic spelling of “mold” or “moult” as in shedding).

   MOULT:
   - M (allowed)
   - O (in position 2, was in position 3 in CLOUT, so new position)
   - U (in position 3, was in position 4 in CLOUT, so new position)
   - L (in position 4, was in position 2 in CLOUT, so new position)
   - T (correct in position 5)

   This satisfies every constraint.

   Therefore, the next guess is MOULT.
</think>

<guess>MOULT</guess>",MOULT,"From the two previous guesses we now know the exact pattern:

- Position 5 is T (✓).
- Positions 1–4 must contain L, O, U each exactly once (because they each received “-” in every position they occupied so far).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, G, H, C, F.

So the word ends with T and has L, O, U somewhere in the first four slots, one each.

Possible permutations of L, O, U among positions 1–4:

1 2 3 4
L O U _  → needs a fifth letter, but we’ve already placed L, O, U and need one more letter in position 4.
The only way to fit L, O, U into four positions is to have one of them in position 1 and the other two in 2 and 3, with the remaining slot (position 4) filled by one of the still-allowed consonants.

Allowed consonants left: B, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list the three distinct permutations of L, O, U across positions 1–4 and append a consonant to the last slot:

Permutations of L, O, U across 1–4:

1. L O U _  → LOU?T – but LOU is 3 letters; we need 5-letter words. Actually, we have 4 slots, so:

   Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
   Pattern:  ? ? ? ? T
   With L, O, U occupying 1, 2, 3 or 1, 3, 4 etc.

   The three distinct permutations of L, O, U across positions 1–4 are:

   a) L O U _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by L,O,U; position 4 needs a consonant.
   b) L U O _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by L,U,O; position 4 needs a consonant.
   c) O L U _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by O,L,U; position 4 needs a consonant.
   d) O U L _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by O,U,L; position 4 needs a consonant.
   e) U L O _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by U,L,O; position 4 needs a consonant.
   f) U O L _  → positions 1,2,3 filled by U,O,L; position 4 needs a consonant.

   But we only have 4 slots (positions 1-4) and 3 letters (L, O, U), so one slot will be empty among 1-4. Actually, we need to place L, O, U into positions 1-4, one each, and the remaining slot (position 4) will be filled by the consonant. Wait, no: positions 1-4 are four slots and we have three letters (L, O, U) to place, so one of the positions 1-4 will be filled by a consonant and the other three will be filled by L, O, U. Actually, no: we have four slots and four letters total (L, O, U plus one consonant). But we know the word ends with T, so the five letters are L, O, U, ?, T.

   Therefore, the four letters in positions 1-4 are L, O, U and one consonant. The consonant must be in one of positions 1-4 and the letters L, O, U must each appear once in positions 1-4.

   So the possible patterns are:

   - [consonant] L O U T
   - [consonant] L U O T
   - [consonant] O L U T
   - [consonant] O U L T
   - [consonant] U L O T

   - V L O U T – not valid.

   Wait, let’s think differently: the letters in positions 1-4 must be some permutation of L, O, U and one consonant, ending with T.

   The only valid English word that fits is:

   - B L O U T – no.
   - B L U O T – no.
   - D L O U T – no.
   - M O U L T – yes! MOULT is a valid word (archaic spelling of “mold” or “moult” as in shedding).

   MOULT:
   - M (allowed)
   - O (in position 2, was in position 3 in CLOUT, so new position)
   - U (in position 3, was in position 4 in CLOUT, so new position)
   - L (in position 4, was in position 2 in CLOUT, so new position)
   - T (correct in position 5)

   This satisfies every constraint.

   Therefore, the next guess is MOULT.",Guess 6: MOULT -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) L(✓) T(✓),FAIL
