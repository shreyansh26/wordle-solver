For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O_.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else, not in position 4.

We now know:
1. The word ends in O (position 4 is not O, but the last letter is O).
2. S is present but not in position 4.
3. Letters A, R, E are excluded.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep the known O in position 4 (but wait, the feedback shows O is in the correct position, so O is in position 3? Wait, let me re-read carefully: the feedback shows O(✓) which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In AROSE, O is in position 3, so the secret word has O in position 3: _ _ O _ _.

Also, S is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in AROSE), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We also know A, R, E are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _ with S somewhere in 1, 2, or 5, and no A, R, E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

Examples:
- SPOON (but P and N are allowed, but we don't know yet)
- STONY (but T, N, Y are allowed)
- SNOUT (but U, T are allowed)
- SHOCK (but C, K are allowed)
- SHOUL (but L is allowed)
- SWOON (but W, N are allowed)
- SLOTH (but L, T, H are allowed)
- SMOKE (but M, K, E – but E is excluded)
- STOMP (but P, M are allowed)

Looking for a word that uses new common letters to test more possibilities. ""STONY"" uses S, T, N, Y – all new letters, and places S in position 1, which is allowed.

Another good candidate is ""SHOCK"" (S, H, C, K), but let's go with ""STONY"" as it tests more distinct letters.

Wait, let me check: STONY – S in position 1 (allowed), T, N, Y are new, and O is in position 3 (correct from feedback). This seems good.

But actually, let me think of a word that also tests position 5 for S. For example, ""SWORD"" – but D is new, but S is in position 1. Or ""SWOON"" – but N is new, S in position 1, W is new.

""STONY"" seems good, but let me think of a better one that tests more new letters. ""SHOUT"" – but U is new, T is new, H is new, S is in position 1. But O is already known in position 3, so this would be S H O U T – but that has O in position 3 (correct), and tests S, H, U, T.

But ""SHOUT"" is a valid word and tests S, H, U, T.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good next guess.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

""SHOUT"" has S in 1, H in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position (was in position 4 in AROSE), so S in position 1 is allowed (since it was not there before). This seems okay.

But actually, let me think of a word that keeps S in a new position. For example, ""SNOUT"" has S in 1, N in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. This tests N and U.

""STONY"" is similar: S, T, O, N, Y.

Both seem good. I'll go with ""STONY"" as it tests T and N and Y.

But actually, let me think of a word that puts S in position 2. For example, ""BOSOM"" – but B, M are new, and S is in position 2. But O is in position 3 (correct), so B O S O M – but that has O in position 2 and 4, which might not be efficient.

""FOIST"" – but F, I, S, T are new, and O is in position 3. This would be F O I S T – but S is in position 4 here, which was its original position (bad), but we know S is not in position 4, so this is okay. However, this tests F, I, T.

This seems messy. Let me stick with ""STONY"" as it's straightforward.

Wait, let me think of ""SLOTH"" – S, L, O, T, H. This tests L, T, H, and puts S in position 1 (allowed).

I think ""STONY"" is fine.

But actually, let me try ""SHOUT"" as it's a common word and tests H, U, T.

I'll go with ""SHOUT"".

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3 ( _ _ O _ _ ).
- S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- A, R, E are excluded.

A good next guess is ""SHOUT"" to test new letters H, U, T while keeping S in position 1 (which is allowed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O_.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else, not in position 4.

We now know:
1. The word ends in O (position 4 is not O, but the last letter is O).
2. S is present but not in position 4.
3. Letters A, R, E are excluded.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep the known O in position 4 (but wait, the feedback shows O is in the correct position, so O is in position 3? Wait, let me re-read carefully: the feedback shows O(✓) which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In AROSE, O is in position 3, so the secret word has O in position 3: _ _ O _ _.

Also, S is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in AROSE), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We also know A, R, E are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _ with S somewhere in 1, 2, or 5, and no A, R, E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

Examples:
- SPOON (but P and N are allowed, but we don't know yet)
- STONY (but T, N, Y are allowed)
- SNOUT (but U, T are allowed)
- SHOCK (but C, K are allowed)
- SHOUL (but L is allowed)
- SWOON (but W, N are allowed)
- SLOTH (but L, T, H are allowed)
- SMOKE (but M, K, E – but E is excluded)
- STOMP (but P, M are allowed)

Looking for a word that uses new common letters to test more possibilities. ""STONY"" uses S, T, N, Y – all new letters, and places S in position 1, which is allowed.

Another good candidate is ""SHOCK"" (S, H, C, K), but let's go with ""STONY"" as it tests more distinct letters.

Wait, let me check: STONY – S in position 1 (allowed), T, N, Y are new, and O is in position 3 (correct from feedback). This seems good.

But actually, let me think of a word that also tests position 5 for S. For example, ""SWORD"" – but D is new, but S is in position 1. Or ""SWOON"" – but N is new, S in position 1, W is new.

""STONY"" seems good, but let me think of a better one that tests more new letters. ""SHOUT"" – but U is new, T is new, H is new, S is in position 1. But O is already known in position 3, so this would be S H O U T – but that has O in position 3 (correct), and tests S, H, U, T.

But ""SHOUT"" is a valid word and tests S, H, U, T.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good next guess.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

""SHOUT"" has S in 1, H in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position (was in position 4 in AROSE), so S in position 1 is allowed (since it was not there before). This seems okay.

But actually, let me think of a word that keeps S in a new position. For example, ""SNOUT"" has S in 1, N in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. This tests N and U.

""STONY"" is similar: S, T, O, N, Y.

Both seem good. I'll go with ""STONY"" as it tests T and N and Y.

But actually, let me think of a word that puts S in position 2. For example, ""BOSOM"" – but B, M are new, and S is in position 2. But O is in position 3 (correct), so B O S O M – but that has O in position 2 and 4, which might not be efficient.

""FOIST"" – but F, I, S, T are new, and O is in position 3. This would be F O I S T – but S is in position 4 here, which was its original position (bad), but we know S is not in position 4, so this is okay. However, this tests F, I, T.

This seems messy. Let me stick with ""STONY"" as it's straightforward.

Wait, let me think of ""SLOTH"" – S, L, O, T, H. This tests L, T, H, and puts S in position 1 (allowed).

I think ""STONY"" is fine.

But actually, let me try ""SHOUT"" as it's a common word and tests H, U, T.

I'll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3 ( _ _ O _ _ ).
- S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- A, R, E are excluded.

A good next guess is ""SHOUT"" to test new letters H, U, T while keeping S in position 1 (which is allowed).

From Guess 3 (BISON) we also learned:
- S is NOT in position 3 (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
- O is NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
- B, I, N are not in the word.

So far, the only confirmed letters are O (position 3) and S (somewhere else).  
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out for S).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains S exactly once, and not in positions 3 or 4.
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set: C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus S and O.

Let’s list remaining consonants that are common and fit: C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We want a word that uses new letters to narrow things down quickly.  
A good candidate is “FLOSS” – but it has two S’s, which is possible, but we’d prefer to test single-S words first.

Next best: “GLOOM” – but M is allowed, and we haven’t tested G or M yet.

Actually, “LOSS” is only four letters.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O_.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else, not in position 4.

We now know:
1. The word ends in O (position 4 is not O, but the last letter is O).
2. S is present but not in position 4.
3. Letters A, R, E are excluded.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep the known O in position 4 (but wait, the feedback shows O is in the correct position, so O is in position 3? Wait, let me re-read carefully: the feedback shows O(✓) which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In AROSE, O is in position 3, so the secret word has O in position 3: _ _ O _ _.

Also, S is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in AROSE), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We also know A, R, E are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _ with S somewhere in 1, 2, or 5, and no A, R, E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

Examples:
- SPOON (but P and N are allowed, but we don't know yet)
- STONY (but T, N, Y are allowed)
- SNOUT (but U, T are allowed)
- SHOCK (but C, K are allowed)
- SHOUL (but L is allowed)
- SWOON (but W, N are allowed)
- SLOTH (but L, T, H are allowed)
- SMOKE (but M, K, E – but E is excluded)
- STOMP (but P, M are allowed)

Looking for a word that uses new common letters to test more possibilities. ""STONY"" uses S, T, N, Y – all new letters, and places S in position 1, which is allowed.

Another good candidate is ""SHOCK"" (S, H, C, K), but let's go with ""STONY"" as it tests more distinct letters.

Wait, let me check: STONY – S in position 1 (allowed), T, N, Y are new, and O is in position 3 (correct from feedback). This seems good.

But actually, let me think of a word that also tests position 5 for S. For example, ""SWORD"" – but D is new, but S is in position 1. Or ""SWOON"" – but N is new, S in position 1, W is new.

""STONY"" seems good, but let me think of a better one that tests more new letters. ""SHOUT"" – but U is new, T is new, H is new, S is in position 1. But O is already known in position 3, so this would be S H O U T – but that has O in position 3 (correct), and tests S, H, U, T.

But ""SHOUT"" is a valid word and tests S, H, U, T.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good next guess.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

""SHOUT"" has S in 1, H in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position (was in position 4 in AROSE), so S in position 1 is allowed (since it was not there before). This seems okay.

But actually, let me think of a word that keeps S in a new position. For example, ""SNOUT"" has S in 1, N in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. This tests N and U.

""STONY"" is similar: S, T, O, N, Y.

Both seem good. I'll go with ""STONY"" as it tests T and N and Y.

But actually, let me think of a word that puts S in position 2. For example, ""BOSOM"" – but B, M are new, and S is in position 2. But O is in position 3 (correct), so B O S O M – but that has O in position 2 and 4, which might not be efficient.

""FOIST"" – but F, I, S, T are new, and O is in position 3. This would be F O I S T – but S is in position 4 here, which was its original position (bad), but we know S is not in position 4, so this is okay. However, this tests F, I, T.

This seems messy. Let me stick with ""STONY"" as it's straightforward.

Wait, let me think of ""SLOTH"" – S, L, O, T, H. This tests L, T, H, and puts S in position 1 (allowed).

I think ""STONY"" is fine.

But actually, let me try ""SHOUT"" as it's a common word and tests H, U, T.

I'll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3 ( _ _ O _ _ ).
- S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- A, R, E are excluded.

A good next guess is ""SHOUT"" to test new letters H, U, T while keeping S in position 1 (which is allowed).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ O _ _  (O is locked in position 3).
2. Letters confirmed in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 4).
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters definitely excluded: A, R, E, H, U, T.

That leaves positions 2 and 5 for S:
- If S is in position 2: _ S O _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ O _ S

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out; O is fixed)

Let’s try the _ S O _ _ pattern first because it’s more common.
A quick scan of common words gives:
- BISON
- DROSS
- FLOSS
- GLOSS
- MISON
- NOSIL
- POSIT
- RISON (but R is excluded)
- TISON (T is excluded)

Valid candidates: BISON, DROSS, FLOSS, GLOSS, MISON, NOSIL, POSIT.

DROSS and FLOSS both contain an extra S, which is allowed (the word could have two S’s, though it’s unlikely).  
BISON, GLOSS, MISON, NOSIL, POSIT are all single-S options.

Let’s pick BISON because it introduces new consonants B, I, N.

Between POGOS and POKOS, POGOS seems more likely.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O_.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else, not in position 4.

We now know:
1. The word ends in O (position 4 is not O, but the last letter is O).
2. S is present but not in position 4.
3. Letters A, R, E are excluded.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep the known O in position 4 (but wait, the feedback shows O is in the correct position, so O is in position 3? Wait, let me re-read carefully: the feedback shows O(✓) which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In AROSE, O is in position 3, so the secret word has O in position 3: _ _ O _ _.

Also, S is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in AROSE), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We also know A, R, E are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _ with S somewhere in 1, 2, or 5, and no A, R, E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

Examples:
- SPOON (but P and N are allowed, but we don't know yet)
- STONY (but T, N, Y are allowed)
- SNOUT (but U, T are allowed)
- SHOCK (but C, K are allowed)
- SHOUL (but L is allowed)
- SWOON (but W, N are allowed)
- SLOTH (but L, T, H are allowed)
- SMOKE (but M, K, E – but E is excluded)
- STOMP (but P, M are allowed)

Looking for a word that uses new common letters to test more possibilities. ""STONY"" uses S, T, N, Y – all new letters, and places S in position 1, which is allowed.

Another good candidate is ""SHOCK"" (S, H, C, K), but let's go with ""STONY"" as it tests more distinct letters.

Wait, let me check: STONY – S in position 1 (allowed), T, N, Y are new, and O is in position 3 (correct from feedback). This seems good.

But actually, let me think of a word that also tests position 5 for S. For example, ""SWORD"" – but D is new, but S is in position 1. Or ""SWOON"" – but N is new, S in position 1, W is new.

""STONY"" seems good, but let me think of a better one that tests more new letters. ""SHOUT"" – but U is new, T is new, H is new, S is in position 1. But O is already known in position 3, so this would be S H O U T – but that has O in position 3 (correct), and tests S, H, U, T.

But ""SHOUT"" is a valid word and tests S, H, U, T.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good next guess.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: _ _ O _ _ with S in 1, 2, or 5.

""SHOUT"" has S in 1, H in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position (was in position 4 in AROSE), so S in position 1 is allowed (since it was not there before). This seems okay.

But actually, let me think of a word that keeps S in a new position. For example, ""SNOUT"" has S in 1, N in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5. This tests N and U.

""STONY"" is similar: S, T, O, N, Y.

Both seem good. I'll go with ""STONY"" as it tests T and N and Y.

But actually, let me think of a word that puts S in position 2. For example, ""BOSOM"" – but B, M are new, and S is in position 2. But O is in position 3 (correct), so B O S O M – but that has O in position 2 and 4, which might not be efficient.

""FOIST"" – but F, I, S, T are new, and O is in position 3. This would be F O I S T – but S is in position 4 here, which was its original position (bad), but we know S is not in position 4, so this is okay. However, this tests F, I, T.

This seems messy. Let me stick with ""STONY"" as it's straightforward.

Wait, let me think of ""SLOTH"" – S, L, O, T, H. This tests L, T, H, and puts S in position 1 (allowed).

I think ""STONY"" is fine.

But actually, let me try ""SHOUT"" as it's a common word and tests H, U, T.

I'll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3 ( _ _ O _ _ ).
- S is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- A, R, E are excluded.

A good next guess is ""SHOUT"" to test new letters H, U, T while keeping S in position 1 (which is allowed).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ O _ _  (O is locked in position 3).
2. Letters confirmed in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 4).
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters definitely excluded: A, R, E, H, U, T.

That leaves positions 2 and 5 for S:
- If S is in position 2: _ S O _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ O _ S

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out; O is fixed)

Let’s try the _ S O _ _ pattern first because it’s more common.
A quick scan of common words gives:
- BISON
- DROSS
- FLOSS
- GLOSS
- MISON
- NOSIL
- POSIT
- RISON (but R is excluded)
- TISON (T is excluded)

Valid candidates: BISON, DROSS, FLOSS, GLOSS, MISON, NOSIL, POSIT.

DROSS and FLOSS both contain an extra S, which is allowed (the word could have two S’s, though it’s unlikely).  
BISON, GLOSS, MISON, NOSIL, POSIT are all single-S options.

Let’s pick BISON because it introduces new consonants B, I, N.

2. Letters in the word: O (position 3), S (must appear once), and whatever letters show up in the next guess.
3. Letters definitely excluded: A, R, E, H, U, T, B, I, N.

From Guess 3 (BISON) we also learned:
- S is NOT in position 3 (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
- O is NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
- B, I, N are not in the word.

So far, the only confirmed letters are O (position 3) and S (somewhere else).  
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out for S).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains S exactly once, and not in positions 3 or 4.
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set: C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus S and O.

Let’s list remaining consonants that are common and fit: C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We want a word that uses new letters to narrow things down quickly.  
A good candidate is “FLOSS” – but it has two S’s, which is possible, but we’d prefer to test single-S words first.

Next best: “GLOOM” – but M is allowed, and we haven’t tested G or M yet.  
However, GLOOM has two O’s, and we only know one O for sure.

“LOSSY” – Y is allowed, but again two S’s.

“WORSE” – R and E are excluded.

“POSSE” – P, S, E – E excluded.

“MOSSY” – M, S, Y allowed.

“LOSSY” – already considered.

“LOSSY” is two S’s; we want to test single-S to learn more.

Let’s pick “LOSSY” anyway because it tests Y and gives us info on double-S, but a better single-S word is “LOSSY” or “LOSS”.

Actually, “LOSS” is only four letters.

We need five letters.

“LOSSY” is fine, but let’s pick a word with distinct letters.

“WORSE” – R and E excluded.

“GROSS” – R excluded.

“DROSS” – R excluded.

“FLOSS” – two S’s.

“LOSSY” – two S’s.

“MOSSY” – two S’s.

“LOSSY” is the only five-letter word with S and allowed letters that has two S’s.

We need a single-S word.

“CLOPS” – C, L, P, S. All allowed.  
“DLOPS” – not a word.

“CLOPS” is valid.

“CLOPS” has S in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s go with CLOPS.

From the feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ O _ S  (S is locked in position 5, O in position 3).
2. Letters confirmed in the word: O (position 3), S (position 5), P (somewhere, but not in position 4).
3. Letters definitely excluded: A, R, E, H, U, T, B, I, N, C, L.

So the word looks like: _ _ O _ S  
and P must appear in position 1 or 2.

Allowed letters left: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, P, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Contains P exactly once, in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- P _ O _ S: P must be in position 1.
- _ P O _ S: P must be in position 2.

Let’s list valid words:
- P _ O _ S: P, _, O, _, S. Possible: POGOS (but O is repeated), POKOS, PYSOS (not valid), etc.
- _ P O _ S: _ , P, O, _, S. Possible: DPOSE (invalid), FPOSS (invalid), GPOSS (invalid), MPOS S (invalid), VPOSS (invalid), WPOSS (invalid).

Actually, let’s think of real words:
- P _ O _ S: P, _, O, _, S. Valid: POGOS (but has two O’s), PYSOS (invalid), POKOS (valid? Yes, ""pokos"" is a plural of poko, though rare), but best is POGOS.
- _ P O _ S: _ , P, O, _, S. Valid: DPOSE (invalid), FPOSS (invalid), but ""FLOSS"" is invalid (L excluded), ""GROSS"" (R excluded), ""LOSSY"" (L excluded), etc.

Wait, let me think differently: allowed consonants are D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus P.

Real words fitting _ _ O _ S with P in 1 or 2:
- P _ O _ S: P, _, O, _, S. Valid: POGOS (but two O’s), PYSOS (invalid), POKOS (valid but rare), but ""POKOS"" is acceptable.
- _ P O _ S: _ , P, O, _, S. Valid: DPOSE (invalid), FPOSS (invalid), but ""FLOSS"" is invalid (L excluded), ""GROSS"" (R excluded), etc.

Actually, let me think of ""DOPES"" – but E is excluded.

""WOPES"" – E excluded.

""VOPES"" – E excluded.

""ZOPES"" – E excluded.

""JOPES"" – E excluded.

""KOPES"" – E excluded.

""YOPES"" – E excluded.

""MOSES"" – E excluded.

""XOPES"" – E excluded.

""QOPES"" – E excluded.

""ZOPFS"" – not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""DOPPS"" – but P is already in position 2.

Actually, let me think of ""DOPPS"" – invalid.

Let me think of ""FOPPS"" – invalid.

""JOPPS"" – invalid.

""KOPPS"" – invalid.

""MOPPS"" – invalid.

""VOPPS"" – invalid.

""WOPPS"" – invalid.

""ZOPPS"" – invalid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine allowed letters.

Allowed letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, P, O, S.

Real words ending in _ _ O _ S:
- P _ O _ S: P, _, O, _, S. Valid: POGOS (but two O’s), PYSOS (invalid), POKOS (valid but rare).
- _ P O _ S: _ , P, O, _, S. Valid: DPOSE (invalid), FPOSS (invalid), but ""FLOSS"" is invalid (L excluded), ""GROSS"" (R excluded), ""LOSSY"" (L excluded), etc.

Actually, let me think of ""GLOPS"" – but L excluded.

""FLOPS"" – L excluded.

""DROPS"" – R and P are in word, but R is excluded.

""PROPS"" – R excluded.

""TOPPS"" – T excluded.

""ZOPFS"" – not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""DOPPS"" – invalid.

Actually, let me think of ""WOPPS"" – invalid.

This seems difficult. Let me think of ""DOPPS"" – invalid.

Let me think of ""FOPPS"" – invalid.

""JOPPS"" – invalid.

""KOPPS"" – invalid.

""MOPPS"" – invalid.

""VOPPS"" – invalid.

""WOPPS"" – invalid.

""ZOPPS"" – invalid.

This suggests that _ P O _ S is not yielding valid words with remaining letters.

Let me try P _ O _ S: P, _, O, _, S.

Valid words:
- POGOS: P, O, G, O, S – but two O’s, and O is only confirmed once.
- PYSOS: invalid.
- POKOS: P, O, K, O, S – two O’s.

This is tricky. Let me think of ""POKOS"" as the best available, even if rare.

But actually, let me think of ""ZOPFS"" – invalid.

Let me think of ""DOPPS"" – invalid.

Another approach: maybe ""DOPPS"" is invalid, but ""FLOSS"" is invalid (L excluded).

Wait, let me think of ""WOPPS"" – invalid.

This seems like a dead end. Let me think of ""JOPPS"" – invalid.

""KOPPS"" – invalid.

""MOPPS"" – invalid.

""VOPPS"" – invalid.

""WOPPS"" – invalid.

""ZOPPS"" – invalid.

This suggests that P must be in position 1: P _ O _ S.

Valid words:
- POGOS: P, O, G, O, S – two O’s, but O is confirmed once, so this is possible (words can have extra letters).
- POKOS: P, O, K, O, S – two O’s.
- PYSOS: invalid.

Between POGOS and POKOS, POGOS seems more likely.

But let me think of ""POKOS"" as better (K is more common than G).

Let me go with POKOS.

However, POKOS is a valid word (plural of poko, a small hut in some cultures).

But let me think of ""ZOPHS"" – invalid.

Another valid word: ""POKOS"".

Thus, the best next guess is POKOS.

But wait, let me think of ""DOPPS"" – invalid.

Actually, let me think of ""FLOSS"" – invalid (L excluded).

This seems to be the only viable option.

Thus, I'll go with POKOS.Based on all feedback:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ S (O in position 3, S in position 5)
- P must appear in position 1 or 2
- Allowed letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, P, O, S

The only valid word fitting these constraints is POKOS (rare plural of poko).

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of \'O\' which is very common in 5-letter words.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O_.\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else, not in position 4.\n\nWe now know:\n1.

""SHOUT"" – but U is new, T is new, H is new, S is in position 1.

From Guess 5 (POKOS) we learned:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → P is in position 1.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is in position 2 (but we already knew it's in position 3 from earlier feedback – this seems contradictory, so let me re-read carefully).

Wait, let me re-express the feedback for POKOS:
P(✓) – P is in position 1 and correct.
O(✓) – First O is in position 2 and correct.
K(x) – K is not in the word.
O(-) – Second O is in the word but wrong position (it was in position 4, so the word has another O not in position 4).
S(✓) – S is in position 5 and correct.

But we already had O(✓) from position 3 in earlier feedback. This implies the word has two O's: one in position 2 and one in position 3. However, in standard English, position 3 was marked ✓ for O in AROSE, meaning O is in position 3. Now in POKOS, the first O is in position 2 and marked ✓, meaning O is in position 2. This suggests the word has O in position 2 and another O in position 3, which is unusual but possible.

But let me re-examine:
- In AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked ✓ → O is in position 3.
- In POKOS, the first O is in position 2 and marked ✓ → O is in position 2.

This is impossible unless the word has two O's. This must be an error in my interpretation. Actually, the feedback symbols apply to each letter's position in the guess, not globally. Let me re-interpret:

For POKOS:
- P: ✓ → P is in position 1 and correct.
- O (position 2): ✓ → O is in position 2 and correct.
- K: x → K is not in the word.
- O (position 4): - → O is in the word but not in position 4 (which we already knew it's in position 3).
- S: ✓ → S is in position 5 and correct.

Thus, the word must be P O _ O S, with:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ? (must be a letter we haven't ruled out)
- Position 4: O (but feedback said O in position 4 is wrong, so this is impossible)
Wait, this suggests the word cannot have O in position 4, but we already have O in position 3 from AROSE. This implies the word has O in position 3 and another O in position 2, making the word P O _ O S. But then the O in position 4 in POKOS would be marked ✓ if it were correct, but it was marked -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 4. This is confusing.

Let me re-express the feedback correctly:
- Each letter's feedback is relative to its position in the guess, not globally.
- From AROSE:
  - A(x), R(x), O(✓) (position 3), S(-) (position 4), E(x)
- From SHOUT:
  - S(-) (position 1), H(x), O(✓) (position 3), U(x), T(x)
- From BISON:
  - B(x), I(x), S(-) (position 3), O(-) (position 4), N(x)
- From CLOPS:
  - C(x), L(x), O(✓) (position 3), P(-) (position 4), S(✓) (position 5)
- From POKOS:
  - P(✓) (position 1), O(✓) (position 2), K(x), O(-) (position 4), S(✓) (position 5)

Now it's clear:
- P is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- K is not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from POKOS: O in position 4 is -, but we already know from AROSE that O is in position 3)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Thus, the word must be P O _ O S, with:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ? (must be a letter we haven't ruled out)
- Position 4: O (but feedback for POKOS said O in position 4 is -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 4 – this is impossible because we already have O in position 3 from AROSE)
This indicates an inconsistency, meaning the word cannot have O in position 4. Therefore, the word must be P O _ _ S, with O in position 3 (from AROSE) and position 2 being O, making it P O O _ S. But then position 4 would have to be a letter not yet ruled out.

Let me re-examine:
From AROSE: O is in position 3 (✓)
From POKOS: O in position 2 is (✓) – this implies O is in position 2
Thus, the word has O in both position 2 and 3: P O O _ S

Now, position 4 must be a letter not yet ruled out. From previous exclusions: A, R, E, H, U, T, B, I, N, C, L, K are excluded. Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, P, O, S.

Possible letters for position 4: D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid 5-letter words ending in _ _ O _ S with P O _ _ S:
- P O O D S (valid word: ""poods"" – variant of pood, but rare)
- P O O F S (invalid)
- P O O G S (invalid)
- P O O J S (invalid)

- P O O V S (invalid)
- P O O W S (invalid)
- P O O X S (invalid)
- P O O Y S (invalid)
- P O O Z S (invalid)

The only valid word is POODS.

Thus, the next guess is POODS.
