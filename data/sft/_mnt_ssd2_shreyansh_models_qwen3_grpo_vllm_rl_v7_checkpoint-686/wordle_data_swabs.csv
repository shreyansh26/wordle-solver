For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern is: S _ A _ _

- Position 2: common consonants like R, N, M
- Position 4: common consonants like R, N, M, D
- Position 5: common ending letters like D, N, K

A word that fits this pattern and uses new common letters is ""SNARF"":

- N - new letter
- A (position 3) - already confirmed ✓
- R - new letter

Common remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out:

- Position 4: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 5: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels I, O, U (since A is already placed).

We still need to test vowels. The only vowel left to confirm is I or O or U, since A is already fixed.

A good next word would test a new vowel and two new consonants. Let’s try “SCAMP”:
- S (✓) – already correct

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern is: S _ A _ _
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T, E

Next, I want to test other common consonants and vowels while keeping the known S and A in place. Good candidates for the remaining positions are:
- Position 2: common consonants like R, N, M
- Position 4: common consonants like R, N, M, D
- Position 5: common ending letters like D, N, K

A word that fits this pattern and uses new common letters is ""SNARF"":
- S (position 1) - already confirmed ✓
- N - new letter
- A (position 3) - already confirmed ✓
- R - new letter
- F - new letter

This gives us three new letters to test while preserving the known correct ones.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
2. SNARF → S(✓) N(x) A(✓) R(x) F(x)

Current deductions:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters eliminated so far: L, T, E, N, R, F
- Still need three more letters for positions 2, 4, 5.

Common remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out:
- Position 2: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 4: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 5: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels I, O, U (since A is already placed).

We still need to test vowels. The only vowel left to confirm is I or O or U, since A is already fixed.

A good next word would test a new vowel and two new consonants. Let’s try “SCAMP”:
- S (✓) – already correct
- C – new consonant
- A (✓) – already correct
- M – new consonant
- P – new consonant

This tests three new letters (C, M, P) and keeps the known correct ones. If any of C, M, P are in the word, we’ll get feedback; if not, we’ll narrow down further.

Let's update what we now know after Guess 4 (SABID):

1. Pattern: S _ A _ _
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
3. From SABID:
   - S(✓) – still correct in position 1
   - A(-) – the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in position 5)
   - B(-) – B is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - I(x) – I is not in the word at all
   - D(x) – D is not in the word at all

So the new pattern is: S _ _ _ A

Letters we still know are in the word:
- B (but not in position 4)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D

Remaining available letters (common ones):
Consonants: G, H, K, V, W, Y
Vowels: O, U

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters from the remaining pool, remembering that B must appear somewhere (but not in position 4).

Possible placements for B:
- Position 2: B _ _ _ A
- Position 3: S _ B _ A

Let's consider possible words:
- S B _ _ A: SB...A – no common 5-letter words
- S _ B _ A: S _ B _ A – possible

So the pattern is S _ B _ A.

Now we need two more letters for positions 2 and 4 from the remaining pool: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Looking for common combinations:
- Position 2: common consonants like G, H, K, V
- Position 4: common consonants or vowels like O, U, G, H, K, V, Y

Let's try ""SHOGA"" – but O is vowel and fits. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed:
- S, H, O, G, A – all are allowed (not in the eliminated list)

But ""SHOGA"" is a bit obscure. More common words:
- ""SHARK"" – but R is eliminated
- ""SHOGY"" – Y is allowed, but is it common?
- ""SWABA"" – but B is in position 3, and we have S W A B A – but A is in position 5, so this would be S W _ B A – but we need position 4 to be a letter, not A.

Wait, the pattern is S _ B _ A, so:
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 4: any allowed letter

Let's try ""SUGBA"" – no, that's not a word.
""SOGAB"" – no.
""SGB...A"" – unlikely.

Better approach: list possible 5-letter words matching S _ B _ A with remaining letters.

Possible letters left: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Let's try:
- S H O B A – but O is vowel, H is consonant, B is in position 4, but B cannot be in position 4 (from SABID feedback: B(-) means B is in word but not in position 4). So B must be in position 3, making the pattern S _ B _ A.

So we need words like S _ B _ A.

Looking at common words:
- ""SHOGA"" – not common
- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated
- ""SABOT"" – T is eliminated
- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated
- ""SABBA"" – double B, but B is allowed, but is it common?

Actually, ""SABBA"" is a valid word (a type of bread in some cultures), but may be obscure.

Another option: ""SUGBA"" – no, not a word.
""SHYBA"" – no.
""SKUBA"" – no.

Wait, let's think systematically. Pattern: S _ B _ A.

Possible combinations:
- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no
- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no
- S H B O A – no

Actually, there aren't many common words fitting S _ B _ A. Let me reconsider.

From SABID feedback:
- A is in position 5 (since it's in word but not in position 3)
- B is in word but not in position 4

So the word must be S _ _ _ A with B somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 4 because B(-) from SABID means B not in position 4). So B must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
1. S B _ _ A
2. S _ B _ A

For pattern 1 (S B _ _ A):
Need positions 3,4 from remaining letters: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Possible words:
- S B O G A – ""SBOGA"" – no
- S B O K A – ""SBOKA"" – no
- S B U G A – ""SBUGA"" – no

Pattern 2 (S _ B _ A):
Need position 2 and 4 from remaining letters.

Possible words:
- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no
- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no
- S U B O A – ""SUBOA"" – no
- S W B O A – ""SWBOA"" – no

This suggests we need to consider that maybe A is in position 5, and B is in position 2 or 3, and look for valid words.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in A with B in position 2 or 3:
- ""SHOGA"" – not common
- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated
- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated
- ""SABBA"" – B is in position 3, A in 5, and letters are allowed (S, A, B, B, A). But is it common?

""SABBA"" seems to be the closest valid word fitting S _ B _ A with remaining letters.

Let's check:
- S (✓)
- A (must be in position 5, so position 2 is A, but A is in word but not in position 3 from SABID, but this would place A in position 2 – allowed)
Wait, no: from SABID, A(-) means A is in word but not in position 3. It doesn't specify where A is, only that B is in word but not in position 4.

So A could be in position 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is A from the pattern S _ _ _ A (since A is in word and not in position 3, and we have S _ A _ _ from SLATE, but SLATE had A in position 3 (✓), so A is in position 3 in the secret word, but SABID had A(-) meaning A is in word but not in position 3. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:

From SLATE: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SNARF: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SCAMP: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SABID: A(-) – A is in word but NOT in position 3.

This is impossible – A cannot be both in position 3 (from SLATE, SNARF, SCAMP) and not in position 3 (from SABID). Therefore, the feedback from SABID must be interpreted differently.

Ah! I think I misread. In SABID:
- The feedback shows S(✓) A(-) B(-) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is in word but NOT in position 2 (since it's ""-"" in position 2)
- B is in word but NOT in position 3 (since it's ""-"" in position 3)
- I and D are not in the word

This changes things!

So current confirmed:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
- From SABID:
   - A is in word but NOT in position 2 (so A must be in position 3, which matches SLATE/ SNARF/ SCAMP feedback) – so no new info on A's position
   - B is in word but NOT in position 3 – so B must be in position 2 or 4

Thus the pattern is S _ A _ _ with B in position 2 or 4.

Letters left: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U

Possible patterns:
1. S B A _ _
2. S _ A B _

For pattern 1 (S B A _ _):
Need positions 4,5 from remaining letters: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U
Possible words:
- S B A G Y – ""SBA GY"" – no
- S B A G O – ""SBA GO"" – no
- S B A H O – ""SBA HO"" – no

Pattern 2 (S _ A B _):
Need position 2 and 5 from remaining letters.
Possible words:
- S G A B O – ""SGABO"" – no
- S H A B O – ""SHABO"" – no
- S U A B O – ""SUABO"" – no
- S W A B O – ""SWABO"" – no
- S Y A B O – ""SYABO"" – no

This suggests we need to consider that maybe B is in position 4, making the pattern S _ A B _.

Looking for common words:
- S H A B O – ""SHABO"" – no
- S U A B O – ""SUABO"" – no
- S G A B O – ""SGABO"" – no

Actually, ""SHABO"" is a valid word (a type of fabric), but is obscure.

Another approach: consider that position 5 could be a vowel O or U.

Let's try ""SHADO"" – but D is eliminated.
""SHAKO"" – K is allowed, O is allowed:
- S H A K O – this is a valid word (a type of hat), and letters are all allowed.

Let's check:
- S (✓)
- H – new
- A (✓ in position 3)
- K – new
- O – new

This fits perfectly.

<guess>SHAKO</guess>
</think>

Based on all feedback so far:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- B must appear somewhere (from SABID: B(-)) but not in position 3
- Therefore B must be in position 2 or 4
- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
- Remaining possible letters: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U

The most promising pattern is S _ A B _ (B in position 4), and the valid word fitting this is ""SHABO"". However, ""SHAKO"" (S H A K O) is a common word that fits S _ A B _ and uses only allowed letters.

<guess>SHAKO</guess>",SHAKO,"Let's update what we now know after Guess 4 (SABID):

3. From SABID:
   - S(✓) – still correct in position 1
   - A(-) – the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in position 5)
   - B(-) – B is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - I(x) – I is not in the word at all
   - D(x) – D is not in the word at all

So the new pattern is: S _ _ _ A

Let's consider possible words:
- S B _ _ A: SB...A – no common 5-letter words
- S _ B _ A: S _ B _ A – possible

So the pattern is S _ B _ A.

Now we need two more letters for positions 2 and 4 from the remaining pool: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Looking for common combinations:
- Position 2: common consonants like G, H, K, V
- Position 4: common consonants or vowels like O, U, G, H, K, V, Y

Let's try ""SHOGA"" – but O is vowel and fits. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed:
- S, H, O, G, A – all are allowed (not in the eliminated list)

But ""SHOGA"" is a bit obscure. More common words:
- ""SHARK"" – but R is eliminated
- ""SHOGY"" – Y is allowed, but is it common?
- ""SWABA"" – but B is in position 3, and we have S W A B A – but A is in position 5, so this would be S W _ B A – but we need position 4 to be a letter, not A.

Wait, the pattern is S _ B _ A, so:
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 4: any allowed letter

Let's try ""SUGBA"" – no, that's not a word.
""SOGAB"" – no.
""SGB...A"" – unlikely.

Better approach: list possible 5-letter words matching S _ B _ A with remaining letters.

Possible letters left: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Let's try:
- S H O B A – but O is vowel, H is consonant, B is in position 4, but B cannot be in position 4 (from SABID feedback: B(-) means B is in word but not in position 4). So B must be in position 3, making the pattern S _ B _ A.

So we need words like S _ B _ A.

Looking at common words:
- ""SHOGA"" – not common
- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated
- ""SABOT"" – T is eliminated
- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated
- ""SABBA"" – double B, but B is allowed, but is it common?

Actually, ""SABBA"" is a valid word (a type of bread in some cultures), but may be obscure.

Another option: ""SUGBA"" – no, not a word.
""SHYBA"" – no.
""SKUBA"" – no.

Wait, let's think systematically. Pattern: S _ B _ A.

Possible combinations:
- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no
- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no
- S H B O A – no

Actually, there aren't many common words fitting S _ B _ A. Let me reconsider.

From SABID feedback:
- A is in position 5 (since it's in word but not in position 3)
- B is in word but not in position 4

So the word must be S _ _ _ A with B somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 4 because B(-) from SABID means B not in position 4). So B must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
1. S B _ _ A
2. S _ B _ A

For pattern 1 (S B _ _ A):
Need positions 3,4 from remaining letters: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Possible words:
- S B O G A – ""SBOGA"" – no
- S B O K A – ""SBOKA"" – no
- S B U G A – ""SBUGA"" – no

Pattern 2 (S _ B _ A):
Need position 2 and 4 from remaining letters.

Possible words:
- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no
- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no
- S U B O A – ""SUBOA"" – no
- S W B O A – ""SWBOA"" – no

This suggests we need to consider that maybe A is in position 5, and B is in position 2 or 3, and look for valid words.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in A with B in position 2 or 3:
- ""SHOGA"" – not common
- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated
- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated
- ""SABBA"" – B is in position 3, A in 5, and letters are allowed (S, A, B, B, A). But is it common?

""SABBA"" seems to be the closest valid word fitting S _ B _ A with remaining letters.

Let's check:
- S (✓)
- A (must be in position 5, so position 2 is A, but A is in word but not in position 3 from SABID, but this would place A in position 2 – allowed)
Wait, no: from SABID, A(-) means A is in word but not in position 3. It doesn't specify where A is, only that B is in word but not in position 4.

So A could be in position 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is A from the pattern S _ _ _ A (since A is in word and not in position 3, and we have S _ A _ _ from SLATE, but SLATE had A in position 3 (✓), so A is in position 3 in the secret word, but SABID had A(-) meaning A is in word but not in position 3. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:

From SLATE: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SNARF: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SCAMP: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SABID: A(-) – A is in word but NOT in position 3.

This is impossible – A cannot be both in position 3 (from SLATE, SNARF, SCAMP) and not in position 3 (from SABID). Therefore, the feedback from SABID must be interpreted differently.

Ah! I think I misread. In SABID:
- The feedback shows S(✓) A(-) B(-) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is in word but NOT in position 2 (since it's ""-"" in position 2)
- B is in word but NOT in position 3 (since it's ""-"" in position 3)
- I and D are not in the word

This changes things!

So current confirmed:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
- From SABID:
   - A is in word but NOT in position 2 (so A must be in position 3, which matches SLATE/ SNARF/ SCAMP feedback) – so no new info on A's position
   - B is in word but NOT in position 3 – so B must be in position 2 or 4

Thus the pattern is S _ A _ _ with B in position 2 or 4.

Letters left: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U

Possible patterns:
1. S B A _ _
2. S _ A B _

For pattern 1 (S B A _ _):
Need positions 4,5 from remaining letters: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U
Possible words:
- S B A G Y – ""SBA GY"" – no
- S B A G O – ""SBA GO"" – no
- S B A H O – ""SBA HO"" – no

Pattern 2 (S _ A B _):
Need position 2 and 5 from remaining letters.
Possible words:
- S G A B O – ""SGABO"" – no
- S H A B O – ""SHABO"" – no
- S U A B O – ""SUABO"" – no
- S W A B O – ""SWABO"" – no
- S Y A B O – ""SYABO"" – no

This suggests we need to consider that maybe B is in position 4, making the pattern S _ A B _.

Looking for common words:
- S H A B O – ""SHABO"" – no
- S U A B O – ""SUABO"" – no
- S G A B O – ""SGABO"" – no

Actually, ""SHABO"" is a valid word (a type of fabric), but is obscure.

Another approach: consider that position 5 could be a vowel O or U.

Let's try ""SHADO"" – but D is eliminated.
""SHAKO"" – K is allowed, O is allowed:
- S H A K O – this is a valid word (a type of hat), and letters are all allowed.

Let's check:
- S (✓)
- H – new
- A (✓ in position 3)
- K – new
- O – new

This fits perfectly.

<guess>SHAKO</guess>Based on all feedback so far:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- B must appear somewhere (from SABID: B(-)) but not in position 3
- Therefore B must be in position 2 or 4
- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
- Remaining possible letters: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U

The most promising pattern is S _ A B _ (B in position 4), and the valid word fitting this is ""SHABO"". However, ""SHAKO"" (S H A K O) is a common word that fits S _ A B _ and uses only allowed letters.",Guess 5: SHAKO -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) K(x) O(x),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern is: S _ A _ _
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T, E

Next, I want to test other common consonants and vowels while keeping the known S and A in place. Good candidates for the remaining positions are:
- Position 2: common consonants like R, N, M
- Position 4: common consonants like R, N, M, D
- Position 5: common ending letters like D, N, K

A word that fits this pattern and uses new common letters is ""SNARF"":
- S (position 1) - already confirmed ✓
- N - new letter
- A (position 3) - already confirmed ✓
- R - new letter
- F - new letter

This gives us three new letters to test while preserving the known correct ones.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
2. SNARF → S(✓) N(x) A(✓) R(x) F(x)

Current deductions:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters eliminated so far: L, T, E, N, R, F
- Still need three more letters for positions 2, 4, 5.

Common remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out:
- Position 2: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 4: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 5: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels I, O, U (since A is already placed).

We still need to test vowels. The only vowel left to confirm is I or O or U, since A is already fixed.

A good next word would test a new vowel and two new consonants. Let’s try “SCAMP”:
- S (✓) – already correct
- C – new consonant
- A (✓) – already correct
- M – new consonant
- P – new consonant

This tests three new letters (C, M, P) and keeps the known correct ones. If any of C, M, P are in the word, we’ll get feedback; if not, we’ll narrow down further.

Current confirmed information:

Remaining unused common letters:
- Consonants: B, D, G, H, K, V, W, Y
- Vowels: I, O, U

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not yet ruled out. Since we have only three slots left and many possible letters, we should pick a word that uses as many new letters as possible to maximize information gain.

A good candidate would use a new vowel and two new consonants. Let's try ""SABIN"":
- S (✓) - correct
- A (✓) - correct
- B - new consonant
- I - new vowel
- N - but N was already eliminated in guess 2 (SNARF feedback: N(x))

Oops, N is eliminated. Let's pick another vowel and consonants. ""SABOT"" uses O (vowel) and B, T (but T is eliminated). ""SAGGY"" uses G, G, Y but repeats G. ""SAVY"" is only 4 letters. ""SABOT"" is invalid due to T. 

Better choice: ""SABOT"" is invalid, try ""SABID"":
- S (✓)
- A (✓)
- B - new
- I - new vowel
- D - new consonant

This fits the pattern and uses three new letters (B, I, D) while keeping the confirmed S and A.

Let's update what we now know after Guess 4 (SABID):

1. Pattern: S _ A _ _
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
3. From SABID:
   - S(✓) – still correct in position 1
   - A(-) – the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in position 5)
   - B(-) – B is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - I(x) – I is not in the word at all
   - D(x) – D is not in the word at all

So the new pattern is: S _ _ _ A

Letters we still know are in the word:
- B (but not in position 4)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D

Remaining available letters (common ones):
Consonants: G, H, K, V, W, Y
Vowels: O, U

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters from the remaining pool, remembering that B must appear somewhere (but not in position 4).

Possible placements for B:
- Position 2: B _ _ _ A
- Position 3: S _ B _ A

Let's consider possible words:
- S B _ _ A: SB...A – no common 5-letter words
- S _ B _ A: S _ B _ A – possible

So the pattern is S _ B _ A.

Now we need two more letters for positions 2 and 4 from the remaining pool: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Looking for common combinations:
- Position 2: common consonants like G, H, K, V
- Position 4: common consonants or vowels like O, U, G, H, K, V, Y

Let's try ""SHOGA"" – but O is vowel and fits. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed:
- S, H, O, G, A – all are allowed (not in the eliminated list)

But ""SHOGA"" is a bit obscure. More common words:
- ""SHARK"" – but R is eliminated
- ""SHOGY"" – Y is allowed, but is it common?
- ""SWABA"" – but B is in position 3, and we have S W A B A – but A is in position 5, so this would be S W _ B A – but we need position 4 to be a letter, not A.

Wait, the pattern is S _ B _ A, so:
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 4: any allowed letter

Let's try ""SUGBA"" – no, that's not a word.
""SOGAB"" – no.
""SGB...A"" – unlikely.

Better approach: list possible 5-letter words matching S _ B _ A with remaining letters.

Possible letters left: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Let's try:
- S H O B A – but O is vowel, H is consonant, B is in position 4, but B cannot be in position 4 (from SABID feedback: B(-) means B is in word but not in position 4). So B must be in position 3, making the pattern S _ B _ A.

So we need words like S _ B _ A.

Looking at common words:
- ""SHOGA"" – not common
- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated
- ""SABOT"" – T is eliminated
- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated
- ""SABBA"" – double B, but B is allowed, but is it common?

Actually, ""SABBA"" is a valid word (a type of bread in some cultures), but may be obscure.

Another option: ""SUGBA"" – no, not a word.
""SHYBA"" – no.
""SKUBA"" – no.

Wait, let's think systematically. Pattern: S _ B _ A.

Possible combinations:
- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no
- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no
- S H B O A – no

Actually, there aren't many common words fitting S _ B _ A. Let me reconsider.

From SABID feedback:
- A is in position 5 (since it's in word but not in position 3)
- B is in word but not in position 4

So the word must be S _ _ _ A with B somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 4 because B(-) from SABID means B not in position 4). So B must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
1. S B _ _ A
2. S _ B _ A

For pattern 1 (S B _ _ A):
Need positions 3,4 from remaining letters: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U.

Possible words:
- S B O G A – ""SBOGA"" – no
- S B O K A – ""SBOKA"" – no
- S B U G A – ""SBUGA"" – no

Pattern 2 (S _ B _ A):
Need position 2 and 4 from remaining letters.

Possible words:
- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no
- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no
- S U B O A – ""SUBOA"" – no
- S W B O A – ""SWBOA"" – no

This suggests we need to consider that maybe A is in position 5, and B is in position 2 or 3, and look for valid words.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in A with B in position 2 or 3:
- ""SHOGA"" – not common
- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated
- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated
- ""SABBA"" – B is in position 3, A in 5, and letters are allowed (S, A, B, B, A). But is it common?

""SABBA"" seems to be the closest valid word fitting S _ B _ A with remaining letters.

Let's check:
- S (✓)
- A (must be in position 5, so position 2 is A, but A is in word but not in position 3 from SABID, but this would place A in position 2 – allowed)
Wait, no: from SABID, A(-) means A is in word but not in position 3. It doesn't specify where A is, only that B is in word but not in position 4.

So A could be in position 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is A from the pattern S _ _ _ A (since A is in word and not in position 3, and we have S _ A _ _ from SLATE, but SLATE had A in position 3 (✓), so A is in position 3 in the secret word, but SABID had A(-) meaning A is in word but not in position 3. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:

From SLATE: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SNARF: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SCAMP: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
From SABID: A(-) – A is in word but NOT in position 3.

This is impossible – A cannot be both in position 3 (from SLATE, SNARF, SCAMP) and not in position 3 (from SABID). Therefore, the feedback from SABID must be interpreted differently.

Ah! I think I misread. In SABID:
- The feedback shows S(✓) A(-) B(-) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is in word but NOT in position 2 (since it's ""-"" in position 2)
- B is in word but NOT in position 3 (since it's ""-"" in position 3)
- I and D are not in the word

This changes things!

So current confirmed:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
- From SABID:
   - A is in word but NOT in position 2 (so A must be in position 3, which matches SLATE/ SNARF/ SCAMP feedback) – so no new info on A's position
   - B is in word but NOT in position 3 – so B must be in position 2 or 4

Thus the pattern is S _ A _ _ with B in position 2 or 4.

Letters left: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U

Possible patterns:
1. S B A _ _
2. S _ A B _

For pattern 1 (S B A _ _):
Need positions 4,5 from remaining letters: G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U
Possible words:
- S B A G Y – ""SBA GY"" – no
- S B A G O – ""SBA GO"" – no
- S B A H O – ""SBA HO"" – no

Pattern 2 (S _ A B _):
Need position 2 and 5 from remaining letters.
Possible words:
- S G A B O – ""SGABO"" – no
- S H A B O – ""SHABO"" – no
- S U A B O – ""SUABO"" – no
- S W A B O – ""SWABO"" – no
- S Y A B O – ""SYABO"" – no

This suggests we need to consider that maybe B is in position 4, making the pattern S _ A B _.

Looking for common words:
- S H A B O – ""SHABO"" – no
- S U A B O – ""SUABO"" – no
- S G A B O – ""SGABO"" – no

Actually, ""SHABO"" is a valid word (a type of fabric), but is obscure.

Another approach: consider that position 5 could be a vowel O or U.

Let's try ""SHADO"" – but D is eliminated.
""SHAKO"" – K is allowed, O is allowed:
- S H A K O – this is a valid word (a type of hat), and letters are all allowed.

Let's check:
- S (✓)
- H – new
- A (✓ in position 3)
- K – new
- O – new

This fits perfectly.

<guess>SHAKO</guess>Based on all feedback so far:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- B must appear somewhere (from SABID: B(-)) but not in position 3
- Therefore B must be in position 2 or 4
- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D
- Remaining possible letters: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U

The most promising pattern is S _ A B _ (B in position 4), and the valid word fitting this is ""SHABO"". However, ""SHAKO"" (S H A K O) is a common word that fits S _ A B _ and uses only allowed letters.

So B must be in position 3, making the pattern S _ B _ A.\n\nSo we need words like S _ B _ A.\n\nLooking at common words:\n- ""SHOGA"" – not common\n- ""SUGAR"" – R is eliminated\n- ""SABOT"" – T is eliminated\n- ""SALSA"" – L is eliminated\n- ""SABBA"" – double B, but B is allowed, but is it common?\n\nActually, ""SABBA"" is a valid word (a type of bread in some cultures), but may be obscure.\n\nAnother option: ""SUGBA"" – no, not a word.\n""SHYBA"" – no.\n""SKUBA"" – no.\n\nWait, let\'s think systematically. Pattern: S _ B _ A.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- S G B O A – ""SGBOA"" – no\n- S H B O A – ""SHBOA"" – no\n- S H B O A – no\n\nActually, there aren\'t many common words fitting S _ B _ A. Let me reconsider.\n\nFrom SABID feedback:\n- A is in position 5 (since it\'s in word but not in position 3)\n- B is in word but not in position 4\n\nSo the word must be S _ _ _ A with B somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 4 because B(-) from SABID means B not in position 4). So B must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nThus possible patterns:\n1. S B _ _ A\n2.

It doesn\'t specify where A is, only that B is in word but not in position 4.\n\nSo A could be in position 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is A from the pattern S _ _ _ A (since A is in word and not in position 3, and we have S _ A _ _ from SLATE, but SLATE had A in position 3 (✓), so A is in position 3 in the secret word, but SABID had A(-) meaning A is in word but not in position 3. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine:\n\nFrom SLATE: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.\nFrom SNARF: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.\nFrom SCAMP: A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.\nFrom SABID: A(-) – A is in word but NOT in position 3.\n\nThis is impossible – A cannot be both in position 3 (from SLATE, SNARF, SCAMP) and not in position 3 (from SABID). Therefore, the feedback from SABID must be interpreted differently.\n\nAh! I think I misread. In SABID:\n- The feedback shows S(✓) A(-) B(-) I(x) D(x)\nThis means:\n- S is correct in position 1 (✓)\n- A is in word but NOT in position 2 (since it\'s ""-"" in position 2)\n- B is in word but NOT in position 3 (since it\'s ""-"" in position 3)\n- I and D are not in the word\n\nThis changes things!\n\nSo current confirmed:\n- Pattern: S _ A _ _\n- Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D\n- From SABID:\n   - A is in word but NOT in position 2 (so A must be in position 3, which matches SLATE/ SNARF/ SCAMP feedback) – so no new info on A\'s position\n   - B is in word but NOT in position 3 – so B must be in position 2 or 4\n\nThus the pattern is S _ A _ _ with B in position 2 or 4.\n\nLetters left: B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, O, U\n\nPossible patterns:\n1.

- K(x) – K is NOT in the word
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word

So the pattern is still: S _ A _ _

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (in addition to previous eliminations):
H, K, O

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- B (from SABID: B(-) – B is in the word but not in position 3)
- A (already locked in position 3)

Therefore B must be in position 2 or 4.

Remaining unused letters (common ones):
B, G, V, W, Y, U

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters from these, and position 5 must be a letter not yet eliminated.

Let's list possible patterns:

1. S B A _ _  (B in position 2)
   - Need positions 4 and 5 from remaining letters: G, V, W, Y, U
   - Possible words: 
     - S B A G Y (""SBA GY"") – no
     - S B A V Y – no
     - S B A W Y – no
     - S B A G U – no
     - S B A V U – no
     - S B A W U – no
     - S B A Y U – no

   None of these are valid English words.

2. S _ A B _  (B in position 4)
   - Need positions 2 and 5 from remaining letters: G, V, W, Y, U
   - Possible words:
     - S G A B Y – ""SGABY"" – no
     - S V A B Y – ""SVABY"" – no
     - S W A B Y – ""SWABY"" – no
     - S Y A B Y – ""SYABY"" – no

     - S W A B U – ""SWABU"" – no
     - S Y A B U – ""SYABU"" – no
     - S U A B U – ""SUABU"" – no

   Again, none of these are valid English words.

This suggests we need to consider that position 5 could be a vowel we haven't tested yet, but our remaining vowels are only U (since A is used, I and E are eliminated, O is eliminated).

Let's try ""SUGAB"" – no, that's not a word.

Wait, let's reconsider the remaining letters more carefully. We have:

Letters in word: S, A, B
Letters not in word: L, T, E, N, R, F, C, M, P, I, D, H, K, O

Remaining possible letters: B, G, V, W, Y, U

But B is already used in the word, so we need to place B in position 2 or 4 and fill the other spots with the remaining letters.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching S _ A _ _ with B in position 2 or 4:

- S B A _ _ : No valid words
- S _ A B _ : The only valid word is ""SWABY"" (though it's rare) or ""SUGAB"" (invalid)

But ""SWABY"" is actually a valid word (a dialectal term for a swab or a person who swabs).

However, let's check if all letters are allowed:
- S, W, A, B, Y – none are in the eliminated list.

Thus, ""SWABY"" is the only plausible remaining word.

But let's think of more common words. Another possibility is ""SUGAR"" but R is eliminated.

Another check: ""SVA_B"" – no.

Actually, ""SUGAB"" is invalid. The only valid word seems to be ""SWABY"".

However, let's also consider ""SUGAB"" is invalid, and we might have missed another word.

Re-examining: remaining letters are B, G, V, W, Y, U.

Possible pattern S _ A B _ with:
- Position 2: G, V, W, Y, U
- Position 5: G, V, W, Y, U

Valid words:
- S G A B Y – ""SGABY"" – no

- S W A B Y – ""SWABY"" – yes (valid)
- S Y A B Y – ""SYABY"" – no
- S U A B Y – ""SUABY"" – no

Thus, ""SWABY"" is the only valid word left.

But let's also consider ""SUGAB"" is invalid, and we might have missed another word.

Upon reflection, ""SWABY"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the constraints.
