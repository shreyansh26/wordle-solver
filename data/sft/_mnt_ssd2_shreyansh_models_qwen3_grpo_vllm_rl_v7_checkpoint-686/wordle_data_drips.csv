For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently occurring in English
- It has no repeating letters, giving maximum coverage

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not position 4).
- A, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains S somewhere except position 4.
- Does not contain A, O, E.

Good next candidates should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Include S in a different position (1, 3, or 5).
3. Use other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) to maximize information.

Possible words:
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) – S in position 4 is invalid (from feedback), so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) – S in position 4 is invalid.
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S) – S in position 5 is valid.
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) – S in position 4 is invalid.
- GRIST (G, R, I, S, T) – S in position 4 is invalid.
- PRISM (P, R, I, S, M) – S in position 4 is invalid.
- TRIMS (T, R, I, M, S) – S in position 5 is valid.

Between DRIPS and TRIMS, DRIPS uses more common consonants (D, P, S, K) and the vowel I, giving good coverage. I’ll go with DRIPS.
