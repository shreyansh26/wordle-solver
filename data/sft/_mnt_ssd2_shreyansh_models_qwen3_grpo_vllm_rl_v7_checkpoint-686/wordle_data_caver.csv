### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- A is NOT in position 3

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both A and E

- A is in position 2 (not 3)

   - Letters IN the word (wrong positions): R, E, A
   - R is not in position 2

Combining everything:
- Must contain: A, E, R
- Must NOT contain: S, L, T, B, D
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5
- R cannot be in position 2

Remaining letters to work with: A, E, R plus C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5

Let's try to place them without conflicts. One systematic way is to list valid permutations of A, E, R among the 5 positions, respecting the constraints, and fill the remaining two slots with unused consonants.

Looking for a word that:
- Uses A, E, R
- Adds two new consonants from the remaining set
- Meets all positional restrictions

A good candidate is ""EARLY"" but L is excluded.

Next candidate: ""CARET"" – but T is excluded.

Next: ""HAREM"":

  - A in 2 (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 3 (allowed)

- No excluded letters (S, L, T, B, D)
This looks valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x)
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E
- Does NOT contain S, L, T
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both A and E
2. Excludes S, L, T
3. Has A somewhere other than position 3
4. Has E somewhere other than position 5

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Let me try a word that places A and E in new positions and introduces new consonants. ""CRANE"" fits:
- C, R, N are new consonants
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback) → Oops, that violates rule 4.

Next try: ""EARLY"" – but L is excluded.

Next try: ""PEACH"" – but C and H are fine, let's check positions:
- P, E, A, C, H
- A is in position 3 (forbidden) – no.

Next try: ""CHAIR"" – but I and R are fine, positions:
- C, H, A, I, R
- A is in position 3 (forbidden) – no.

Next try: ""HEART"":
- H, E, A, R, T – but T is excluded.

Next try: ""MERGE"":
- M, E, R, G, E – E appears twice, and positions:
- E in 2 and 5 – 5th E is forbidden.

Next try: ""PANEL"":
- P, A, N, E, L – L is excluded.

Next try: ""BEACH"":
- B, E, A, C, H
- A in 3 – no.

Next try: ""BREAD"":
- B, R, E, A, D
- A in 4 (ok), E in 3 (ok), no S/L/T – this looks good.

""BREAD"" meets all constraints:
- Letters: B, R, E, A, D
- No S, L, T
- A is in position 4 (not 3)
- E is in position 3 (not 5)

Guess 2: BREAD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T
   - Letters IN the word (wrong positions): A, E
   - A is not in position 3
   - E is not in position 5

2. BREAD → B(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: B, D
   - Letters IN the word (wrong positions): R, E, A
   - R is not in position 2
   - E is not in position 3
   - A is not in position 4

Combining everything:
- Must contain: A, E, R
- Must NOT contain: S, L, T, B, D
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5
- R cannot be in position 2

Remaining letters to work with: A, E, R plus C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5

Let's try to place them without conflicts. One systematic way is to list valid permutations of A, E, R among the 5 positions, respecting the constraints, and fill the remaining two slots with unused consonants.

Looking for a word that:
- Uses A, E, R
- Adds two new consonants from the remaining set
- Meets all positional restrictions

A good candidate is ""EARLY"" but L is excluded.

Next candidate: ""CARET"" – but T is excluded.

Next: ""HAREM"":
- H, A, R, E, M
- Check positions:
  - A in 2 (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 3 (allowed)
  - H and M are new consonants
- No excluded letters (S, L, T, B, D)
This looks valid.

Alternatively, ""HAROM"" is the same letters in different order but not a valid English word.

""HAREM"" is a valid English word meaning a collection of concubines.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

From the latest feedback on RAVEN:

- R(-) : R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(✓) : A is correctly in position 2.
- V(✓) : V is correctly in position 3.
- E(✓) : E is correctly in position 4.
- N(x) : N is NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now:
1: ?
2: A
3: V
4: E
5: ?

Letters we know:
- Must have: A, V, E in positions 2,3,4
- Must have R somewhere, but NOT in positions 1,2,3,4 (from R(-) in RAVEN and previous R(-) in HAREM and BREAD). Therefore R must be in position 5.
- Cannot have: S, L, T, B, D, H, M, N

Thus the word must be: _ A V E R

The only letter left to determine is position 1. It must be a consonant not yet excluded and not already used (A, V, E, R are used). Available consonants: C, F, G, I, K, O, P, U, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in AVER:
- C A V E R → CAVER (valid word)
- F A V E R → FAVER (not a common word)
- G A V E R → GAVER (not standard)
- K A V E R → KAVER (not standard)
- P A V E R → PAVER (valid word)

Between CAVER and PAVER, both are valid, but let's check which fits better. Both are possible, but CAVER is more common as a word (someone who cavers).

Thus, the guess is CAVER.
