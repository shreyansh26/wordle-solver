For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word like ""AROSE"" contains three vowels and two very common consonants, which should provide good coverage. This will help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes the vowel 'O' which is slightly more common than 'E' in the first position.

- No A or R.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

- Letters in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D.
- S cannot be in position 3 or 4 (already 4 is E), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is O, so S must be in position 1 or 5.
- The word structure so far: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not A, R, P, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).

Let's try S O _ E _ first. Possible third letters: common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T. Let's pick a common one like ""T"" making S O T E _. Then the fifth letter must be a consonant not used yet. Let's try ""L"" making S O T E L. Check if ""SOTEL"" is a valid word – no, it's not.

Next, try S O N E _ – ""SONE"" is a prefix but not a common word. ""SONES"" is plural but has S at start and end.

Try S O B E _ – ""SOBE"" + ? Not valid.

Try S O L E _ – ""SOLE"" + ? ""SOLES"" is valid (plural of sole).

Check if ""SOLES"" fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- L in position 3 (new letter, not ruled out)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (allowed since S can be here)

""SOLES"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Alternative: _ O _ E S. Let's see: possible first letter consonants, third letter consonant or vowel. Example: T O I E S – ""TOIES"" not valid. C O W E S – ""COWES"" is valid but less common. ""FOGES"" not valid. ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – ""HOMES"" is valid. Check constraints:
- H not ruled out
- O position 2 correct
- M not ruled out
- E position 4 correct
- S position 5 correct (since S can't be 3 or 4)

""HOMES"" is also valid. Between ""SOLES"" and ""HOMES"", both fit. ""SOLES"" has S in both ends which might be more informative, but ""HOMES"" tests H and M. I'll go with ""SOLES"" as it directly tests S in position 1 and 5.

But wait, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which is allowed, but the feedback on AROSE said S is not in position 4, and on POSED S is not in position 3. So S can be in 1,2,5 but 2 is O, so 1 or 5. Thus ""SOLES"" has S in 1 and 5, which is acceptable as two separate positions.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which would be correct if S is indeed in position 5, but we don't know yet. ""HOMES"" has S in position 5 and tests H and M.

- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E, but not A or R.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, E.
2. Does not contain A or R.
3. Places O, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Possible positions:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One candidate is “POSED”:
- Letters: P, O, S, E, D.
- Contains O, S, E.
- No A or R.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down the possibilities further.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D.
- S cannot be in position 3 or 4 (already 4 is E), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is O, so S must be in position 1 or 5.
- The word structure so far: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not A, R, P, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).

Let's try S O _ E _ first. Possible third letters: common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T. Let's pick a common one like ""T"" making S O T E _. Then the fifth letter must be a consonant not used yet. Let's try ""L"" making S O T E L. Check if ""SOTEL"" is a valid word – no, it's not.

Next, try S O N E _ – ""SONE"" is a prefix but not a common word. ""SONES"" is plural but has S at start and end.

Try S O B E _ – ""SOBE"" + ? Not valid.

Try S O L E _ – ""SOLE"" + ? ""SOLES"" is valid (plural of sole).

Check if ""SOLES"" fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- L in position 3 (new letter, not ruled out)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (allowed since S can be here)

""SOLES"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Alternative: _ O _ E S. Let's see: possible first letter consonants, third letter consonant or vowel. Example: T O I E S – ""TOIES"" not valid. C O W E S – ""COWES"" is valid but less common. ""FOGES"" not valid. ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – ""HOMES"" is valid. Check constraints:
- H not ruled out
- O position 2 correct
- M not ruled out
- E position 4 correct
- S position 5 correct (since S can't be 3 or 4)

""HOMES"" is also valid. Between ""SOLES"" and ""HOMES"", both fit. ""SOLES"" has S in both ends which might be more informative, but ""HOMES"" tests H and M. I'll go with ""SOLES"" as it directly tests S in position 1 and 5.

But wait, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which is allowed, but the feedback on AROSE said S is not in position 4, and on POSED S is not in position 3. So S can be in 1,2,5 but 2 is O, so 1 or 5. Thus ""SOLES"" has S in 1 and 5, which is acceptable as two separate positions.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which would be correct if S is indeed in position 5, but we don't know yet. ""HOMES"" has S in position 5 and tests H and M.

I think ""HOMES"" is a better choice as it tests new consonants H and M while keeping S in position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word like ""AROSE"" contains three vowels and two very common consonants, which should provide good coverage. This will help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes the vowel 'O' which is slightly more common than 'E' in the first position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E, but not A or R.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, E.
2. Does not contain A or R.
3. Places O, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Possible positions:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One candidate is “POSED”:
- Letters: P, O, S, E, D.
- Contains O, S, E.
- No A or R.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down the possibilities further.

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D.
- S cannot be in position 3 or 4 (already 4 is E), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is O, so S must be in position 1 or 5.
- The word structure so far: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not A, R, P, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).

Let's try S O _ E _ first. Possible third letters: common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T. Let's pick a common one like ""T"" making S O T E _. Then the fifth letter must be a consonant not used yet. Let's try ""L"" making S O T E L. Check if ""SOTEL"" is a valid word – no, it's not.

Next, try S O N E _ – ""SONE"" is a prefix but not a common word. ""SONES"" is plural but has S at start and end.

Try S O B E _ – ""SOBE"" + ? Not valid.

Try S O L E _ – ""SOLE"" + ? ""SOLES"" is valid (plural of sole).

Check if ""SOLES"" fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- L in position 3 (new letter, not ruled out)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (allowed since S can be here)

""SOLES"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Alternative: _ O _ E S. Let's see: possible first letter consonants, third letter consonant or vowel. Example: T O I E S – ""TOIES"" not valid. C O W E S – ""COWES"" is valid but less common. ""FOGES"" not valid. ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – ""HOMES"" is valid. Check constraints:
- H not ruled out
- O position 2 correct
- M not ruled out
- E position 4 correct
- S position 5 correct (since S can't be 3 or 4)

""HOMES"" is also valid. Between ""SOLES"" and ""HOMES"", both fit. ""SOLES"" has S in both ends which might be more informative, but ""HOMES"" tests H and M. I'll go with ""SOLES"" as it directly tests S in position 1 and 5.

But wait, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which is allowed, but the feedback on AROSE said S is not in position 4, and on POSED S is not in position 3. So S can be in 1,2,5 but 2 is O, so 1 or 5. Thus ""SOLES"" has S in 1 and 5, which is acceptable as two separate positions.

However, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which would be correct if S is indeed in position 5, but we don't know yet. ""HOMES"" has S in position 5 and tests H and M.

I think ""HOMES"" is a better choice as it tests new consonants H and M while keeping S in position 5.

Final choice: HOMES

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. \n\nCommon letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word like ""AROSE"" contains three vowels and two very common consonants, which should provide good coverage. This will help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes the vowel \'O\' which is slightly more common than \'E\' in the first position.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.\n- O(-) – O is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.\n- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the 4th position.\n- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains O, S, E, but not A or R.\n- O cannot be in position 3.\n- S cannot be in position 4.\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Contains O, S, E.\n2. Does not contain A or R.\n3. Places O, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.\n\nPossible positions:\n- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One candidate is “POSED”:\n- Letters: P, O, S, E, D.\n- Contains O, S, E.\n- No A or R.\n- O is in position 2 (allowed).\n- S is in position 3 (allowed).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed).\n\nThis seems like a good second guess to narrow down the possibilities further.\n\n<guess>POSED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on POSED:\n- P(x) – P is not in the word.\n- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).\n- D(x) – D is not in the word.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere else).\n- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D.\n- S cannot be in position 3 or 4 (already 4 is E), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is O, so S must be in position 1 or 5.\n- The word structure so far: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere in 1 or 5.\n\nPossible words:\n- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _\n- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S\n\nWe need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not A, R, P, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).\n\nLet\'s try S O _ E _ first. Possible third letters: common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T. Let\'s pick a common one like ""T"" making S O T E _. Then the fifth letter must be a consonant not used yet. Let\'s try ""L"" making S O T E L. Check if ""SOTEL"" is a valid word – no, it\'s not.\n\nNext, try S O N E _ – ""SONE"" is a prefix but not a common word. ""SONES"" is plural but has S at start and end.\n\nTry S O B E _ – ""SOBE"" + ? Not valid.\n\nTry S O L E _ – ""SOLE"" + ? ""SOLES"" is valid (plural of sole).\n\nCheck if ""SOLES"" fits:\n- S in position 1 (allowed)\n- O in position 2 (correct)\n- L in position 3 (new letter, not ruled out)\n- E in position 4 (correct)\n- S in position 5 (allowed since S can be here)\n\n""SOLES"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.\n\nAlternative: _ O _ E S. Let\'s see: possible first letter consonants, third letter consonant or vowel. Example: T O I E S – ""TOIES"" not valid. C O W E S – ""COWES"" is valid but less common. ""FOGES"" not valid. ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – ""HOMES"" is valid. Check constraints:\n- H not ruled out\n- O position 2 correct\n- M not ruled out\n- E position 4 correct\n- S position 5 correct (since S can\'t be 3 or 4)\n\n""HOMES"" is also valid. Between ""SOLES"" and ""HOMES"", both fit. ""SOLES"" has S in both ends which might be more informative, but ""HOMES"" tests H and M. I\'ll go with ""SOLES"" as it directly tests S in position 1 and 5.\n\nBut wait, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which is allowed, but the feedback on AROSE said S is not in position 4, and on POSED S is not in position 3. So S can be in 1,2,5 but 2 is O, so 1 or 5. Thus ""SOLES"" has S in 1 and 5, which is acceptable as two separate positions.\n\nHowever, ""SOLES"" has S in position 5 which would be correct if S is indeed in position 5, but we don\'t know yet. ""HOMES"" has S in position 5 and tests H and M.\n\nI think ""HOMES"" is a better choice as it tests new consonants H and M while keeping S in position 5.\n\nFinal choice: HOMES\n\n<guess>HOMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on HOMES:\n- H(x) – H is not in the word.\n- O(✓) – O is in the correct position (position 2).\n- M(x) – M is not in the word.\n- E(✓) – E is in the correct position (position 4).\n- S(✓) – S is in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo the word structure is now:\n- Position 1: ?\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 3: ?\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: S\n\nLetters confirmed in the word: O, E, S.\nLetters confirmed NOT in the word: A, R, P, D, H, M.\n\nWe need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Wait – we also haven’t tried placing the vowel “I” or “U” in position 3 directly. Let’s re-examine:

Actually, position 3 could be any of the remaining letters, including vowels I or U.

Try:
- B O U E S → not valid
- F O U E S → not valid
- G O U E S → not valid
- L O U E S → not valid
- T O U E S → not valid

Only remaining consonants that fit and form a valid word are B and L in position 1, with I in position 3.

But “BO IES” is not valid. 

Wait – let’s list all valid English words matching “? O ? E S” with the remaining letters:

From a dictionary check:
- B O I E S – invalid
- B O L E S – invalid
- F O I E S – invalid
- F O L E S – invalid
- G O I E S – invalid
- G O L E S – invalid
- L O I E S – invalid
- L O G E S – invalid
- T O I E S – invalid
- T O G E S – invalid

However, one valid word remains:
- B O G E S – but G is allowed and B is allowed, and this forms “BOGES” which is a valid variant spelling of “bogey”.

But “BOGES” uses G in position 3, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Let me verify:
- B (pos 1) – not ruled out
- O (pos 2) – correct
- G (pos 3) – not ruled out
- E (pos 4) – correct

“BOGES” is indeed a valid 5-letter English word.
