### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- STARE

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Very common vowel

This gives us a good mix of high-frequency letters that should provide useful information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word is C _ _ _ _ and none of R, A, N, E appear anywhere else.  
I need a word that starts with C and avoids R, A, N, E entirely, while still using common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: S, T, L, D, P, M, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U, Y.

A balanced choice is “CLOUD”:
- Starts with C (fixed).
- Uses L, O, U, D – none of which are excluded.
- Contains two vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (L, D) to test multiple possibilities.

Other candidates like “CHIPS”, “COBIA”, or “CUPID” would also work, but “CLOUD” feels slightly more common and spreads the test across useful letters.

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is fixed in position 1.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. CLOUD → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
   - C is still correct in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - U and D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: C _ O _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, U, D
- Letter L is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.

Remaining letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters that haven’t been ruled out and place L somewhere other than position 2.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is already O, so L must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try a word that places L in position 4 and tests common remaining consonants and vowels.

Candidate: C H O L I
- C(✓) H(?) O(✓) L(✓) I(?)
This tests H and I in positions 2 and 5.

Another candidate: C H O L K
But K is less common, so let’s go with CHOLI (a valid word meaning a type of Indian bread).

Wait, let me double-check:
- CHOLI: C(✓), H(?) in position 2, O(✓) in position 3, L(✓) in position 4, I(?) in position 5.
This fits all constraints: starts with C, has O in position 3, L in position 4 (not 2), and avoids all excluded letters.

Let’s use CHOLI.
