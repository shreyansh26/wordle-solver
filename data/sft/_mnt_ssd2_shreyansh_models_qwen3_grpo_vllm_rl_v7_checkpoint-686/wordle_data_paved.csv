### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of both vowels and consonants, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain R, O, or S.

- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, O, S, L, N, T).
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s look for such a word. A promising candidate is “BEACH”:
- B, E, A, C, H
- Contains both A and E.
- Does not contain any ruled-out letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since we only know A is not in 1 or 3 from LEANT, but wait – LEANT told us A is not in position 3. So A cannot be in 1 or 3. Therefore, A must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- E is in position 2 – but LEANT told us E is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

Next try: “PEACH”
- P, E, A, C, H
- A in position 3 – again invalid (A not allowed in 3).

Try “HEAVE”:
- H, E, A, V, E
- A in position 3 – invalid.

Try “MEDIA”:

Try “CAMEL” – but L is ruled out.

Try “PAYER” – R is ruled out.

Try “VEXED” – contains X and D; let’s see:
- V, E, X, E, D
- A is missing, so invalid.

Try “CAGED”:
- C, A, G, E, D
- A in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).

Try “HEAVE”:
- H, E, A, V, E
- A in position 3 – invalid.

Try “MEDIA”:
- M, E, D, I, A
- A in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (invalid).

Try “CAMEL” – but L is ruled out.

Try “PAYER” – R is ruled out.

Try “VEXED” – contains X and D; let’s see:
- V, E, X, E, D
- A is missing, so invalid.

Try “CAGED”:
- C, A, G, E, D
- A in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
- Letters used: C, A, G, E, D – none are ruled out.
- This looks valid.

Therefore, a good next guess is “CAGED”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of both vowels and consonants, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S
- A cannot be in position 1, and E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. Has A not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A good next step is to try a word with A and E in different positions and other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

One such word is “LEANT”:
- L, E, A, N, T
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain R, O, or S.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), and E is in position 2 (not 5).

This seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
A, R, O, S, E, L, N, T

From the feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are NOT in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. LEANT → L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - L, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far:
- Confirmed letters in the word: A, E
- Confirmed letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, O, S, L, N, T).
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s look for such a word. A promising candidate is “BEACH”:
- B, E, A, C, H
- Contains both A and E.
- Does not contain any ruled-out letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since we only know A is not in 1 or 3 from LEANT, but wait – LEANT told us A is not in position 3. So A cannot be in 1 or 3. Therefore, A must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- E is in position 2 – but LEANT told us E is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

Next try: “PEACH”
- P, E, A, C, H
- A in position 3 – again invalid (A not allowed in 3).

Try “HEAVE”:
- H, E, A, V, E
- A in position 3 – invalid.

Try “MEDIA”:
- M, E, D, I, A
- A in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (invalid).

Try “CAMEL” – but L is ruled out.

Try “PAYER” – R is ruled out.

Try “VEXED” – contains X and D; let’s see:
- V, E, X, E, D
- A is missing, so invalid.

Try “CAGED”:
- C, A, G, E, D
- A in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
- Letters used: C, A, G, E, D – none are ruled out.
- This looks valid.

Therefore, a good next guess is “CAGED”.

So this is invalid.\n\nNext try: “PEACH”\n- P, E, A, C, H\n- A in position 3 – again invalid (A not allowed in 3).\n\nTry “HEAVE”:\n- H, E, A, V, E\n- A in position 3 – invalid.\n\nTry “MEDIA”:\n- M, E, D, I, A\n- A in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (invalid).\n\nTry “CAMEL” – but L is ruled out.\n\nTry “PAYER” – R is ruled out.\n\nTry “VEXED” – contains X and D; let’s see:\n- V, E, X, E, D\n- A is missing, so invalid.\n\nTry “CAGED”:\n- C, A, G, E, D\n- A in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).\n- Letters used: C, A, G, E, D – none are ruled out.\n- This looks valid.\n\nTherefore, a good next guess is “CAGED”.\n\n<guess>CAGED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: CAGED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on CAGED:\n\nC(x) → C is NOT in the word.  \nA(✓) → A is in position 2.  \nG(x) → G is NOT in the word.  \nE(✓) → E is in position 4.  \nD(✓) → D is in position 5.\n\nSo we now know the exact pattern:\n\n_ A _ E D\n\nLetters already ruled out: R, O, S, L, N, T, C, G.\n\nLetters still allowed (from the remaining pool) for positions 1 and 3:  \nB, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A _ E D and uses only allowed letters.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- B A V E D  (but “BAVED” isn’t a valid word)\n- M A I E D  (invalid)\n- H A I E D  (invalid)\n- P A U E D  (invalid)\n- F A K E D  (invalid)\n- V A M E D  (invalid)\n- W A I E D  (invalid)\n- Y A P E D  (invalid)\n\nThe only valid English word that fits the pattern _ A _ E D and uses allowed letters is:\n\nM A I E D  – but “MAIED” isn’t valid.  \nH A I E D  – not valid.  \nP A I E D  – “PAIEd” is valid (past tense of pay).\n\n“PAIEd” uses:\n- P (allowed in position 1)  \n- A (known in position 2)  \n- I (allowed in position 3)  \n- E (known in position 4)  \n- D (known in position 5)\n\nAll letters are allowed, and it’s a valid word.\n\n<guess>PAIEd</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: CAGED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) D(✓)\nGuess 4: PAIEd -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now have the exact pattern:

P A _ E D

and we know the third letter must be such that the whole word is valid and all letters used are allowed.

Letters already confirmed:
- Position 1: P (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: D (✓)

Letters ruled out: R, O, S, L, N, T, C, G, I.

So the third position can only be one of the remaining letters: B, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form P A _ E D.

Looking at the options:

- P A B E D → ""PABED"" – not a valid word
- P A F E D → ""PAFED"" – not a valid word
- P A H E D → ""PAHED"" – not a valid word
- P A K E D → ""PAKED"" – not a valid word
- P A M E D → ""PAMED"" – not a valid word
- P A U E D → ""PUED"" – but that's 4 letters
- P A V E D → ""PAVED"" – valid word
- P A W E D → ""PAWED"" – valid word
- P A Y E D → ""PA YED"" – valid word (past tense of pay)

Between ""PAVED"", ""PAWED"", and ""PA YED"", ""PA YED"" is the only valid 5-letter form (with space for the dollar sign if needed, but as a word it's ""PA YED"").

However, ""PAWED"" is also valid. Let me check which one is more likely.

But ""PAVED"" is a common word meaning ""paved"" (past tense of pave), and all letters are allowed.

Therefore, the correct guess is ""PAVED"".
