From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 3rd position
- S: - → in the word but wrong position (so not position 4)
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd spot and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). Let’s think of words that fit the pattern _ _ O _ _ with S in one of the remaining spots, and without A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word with common remaining letters. Good candidates:
- SPOIL (but has I, which is allowed)
- SNOOK (but has N and K, and two O’s)
- STOIC (but has T, I, C)
- SLOSH (but has L, S, H)
- SMOKE (but has M, K, E – E is excluded)
- SHOWN (but has H, W, N)

Looking at these, ""SPOIL"" seems good: S _ O _ _ with P, I, L allowed. But let’s check if S is in position 1 here – that’s fine since S can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Another good option is ""STOIC"": S T O I C. This has S in position 1, O in position 3, and uses T, I, C which are all allowed.

I’ll go with STOIC as it uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain multiple common vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might give us good coverage. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 3rd position
- S: - → in the word but wrong position (so not position 4)
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd spot and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). Let’s think of words that fit the pattern _ _ O _ _ with S in one of the remaining spots, and without A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word with common remaining letters. Good candidates:

- SNOOK (but has N and K, and two O’s)
- STOIC (but has T, I, C)
- SLOSH (but has L, S, H)

4. I is not in the word (x).
5. C is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

So far we have: S _ O _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, E, T, I): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

C must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 5, it must be in 2 or 4).

Possible patterns:
- S C O _ _ (C in position 2)
- S _ O C _ (C in position 4)

Let’s explore SC... options:
- SCOOP (but P is allowed, but we have no info on P yet)
- SCOBY (but Y is allowed)
- SCOLD (D is allowed)
- SCOUR (but R is excluded)

Exploring S _ O C _ options:
- SHOCK (H, K allowed)
- SNOC... (SNOC is not a word)
- SPOCK (P, K allowed)

""SHOCK"" seems valid: S H O C K. It fits S _ O C _ pattern, uses allowed letters, and C is in position 4 (allowed since it can’t be in 5).

Another candidate: ""SPOCK"" – but P is allowed, but we have no info on P yet. However, ""SHOCK"" is more common.

I’ll go with SHOCK.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain multiple common vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might give us good coverage. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants, all of which are very common in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 3rd position
- S: - → in the word but wrong position (so not position 4)
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd spot and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). Let’s think of words that fit the pattern _ _ O _ _ with S in one of the remaining spots, and without A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word with common remaining letters. Good candidates:
- SPOIL (but has I, which is allowed)
- SNOOK (but has N and K, and two O’s)
- STOIC (but has T, I, C)
- SLOSH (but has L, S, H)
- SMOKE (but has M, K, E – E is excluded)
- SHOWN (but has H, W, N)

Looking at these, ""SPOIL"" seems good: S _ O _ _ with P, I, L allowed. But let’s check if S is in position 1 here – that’s fine since S can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Another good option is ""STOIC"": S T O I C. This has S in position 1, O in position 3, and uses T, I, C which are all allowed.

I’ll go with STOIC as it uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

- SCOPY – valid (SCOPY is an archaic variant of ""scope,"" but more importantly, ""SCOPY"" is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries)

However, ""SCOPY"" is valid, but let's check if there's a more common word. The only common word fitting S C O _ P is ""SCOPY"" (as SCOPY is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of ""scope"").

But wait, let me double-check: are there any standard English 5-letter words S C O _ P? The standard word is ""SCOPY"" (rare) or ""SCOP"" (4 letters). It seems ""SCOPY"" is actually the correct 5-letter form here.

Thus, the only remaining letter for position 4 is Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain multiple common vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might give us good coverage. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants, all of which are very common in English words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 3rd position
- S: - → in the word but wrong position (so not position 4)
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd spot and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). Let’s think of words that fit the pattern _ _ O _ _ with S in one of the remaining spots, and without A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word with common remaining letters. Good candidates:
- SPOIL (but has I, which is allowed)
- SNOOK (but has N and K, and two O’s)
- STOIC (but has T, I, C)
- SLOSH (but has L, S, H)
- SMOKE (but has M, K, E – E is excluded)
- SHOWN (but has H, W, N)

Looking at these, ""SPOIL"" seems good: S _ O _ _ with P, I, L allowed. But let’s check if S is in position 1 here – that’s fine since S can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Another good option is ""STOIC"": S T O I C. This has S in position 1, O in position 3, and uses T, I, C which are all allowed.

I’ll go with STOIC as it uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ from both guesses).
2. S is in the word and must be in position 1 (✓ from STOIC).
3. T is not in the word (x).
4. I is not in the word (x).
5. C is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
6. A, R, E are not in the word (from AROSE).

So far we have: S _ O _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, E, T, I): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

C must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 5, it must be in 2 or 4).

Possible patterns:
- S C O _ _ (C in position 2)
- S _ O C _ (C in position 4)

Let’s explore SC... options:
- SCOOP (but P is allowed, but we have no info on P yet)
- SCOBY (but Y is allowed)
- SCOLD (D is allowed)
- SCOUR (but R is excluded)

Exploring S _ O C _ options:
- SHOCK (H, K allowed)
- SNOC... (SNOC is not a word)
- SPOCK (P, K allowed)

""SHOCK"" seems valid: S H O C K. It fits S _ O C _ pattern, uses allowed letters, and C is in position 4 (allowed since it can’t be in 5).

Another candidate: ""SPOCK"" – but P is allowed, but we have no info on P yet. However, ""SHOCK"" is more common.

I’ll go with SHOCK.

3. Therefore, word must be: S C O _ _
4. Letters already ruled out (from all feedback): A, R, E, T, I, H, K
5. Remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5 (from allowed list): B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- SCOUR (R is excluded) – invalid
- SCOFF – uses F (allowed)

- SCUBA – uses U, B, A (A excluded) – invalid
- SCAMP – uses M, P (allowed)
- SCANT – uses N, T (T excluded) – invalid
