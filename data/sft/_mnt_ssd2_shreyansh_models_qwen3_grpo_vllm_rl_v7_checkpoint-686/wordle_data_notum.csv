For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have 3-4 vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This gives us the best chance to quickly narrow down the secret word based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to keep narrowing things down.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are ruled out).

A strong second guess would be a word that tests several of these new letters while placing O in a different position. The word ""POINT"" is attractive because:
- P, I, N, T are all common and untested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - O (and it is in position 2).
   - N (but not in position 4).
   - T (but not in position 5).

So the pattern so far looks like:
_ O _ _ _

and the remaining letters must include N and T somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but N ≠ 4, T ≠ 5).

Other letters still available (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains N and T (in allowable positions).
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

A quick scan for common words fitting _O__ _ with N and T gives “MOUNT”:
- M, U are still allowed.
- N is in position 4 (allowed because N was only excluded from position 4 in the previous guess, but that was POINT where N was in position 4 and got “-” so it’s still allowed elsewhere).
- T is in position 5, but T was excluded from position 5 in POINT (feedback T(-)), so T cannot be in position 5. Therefore MOUNT is invalid.

Next candidate: “BOUNT” – but T would again be in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “DOUNT” – same problem.

Next: “HOTEL” – but E is already excluded.

Next: “COUTH” – but U and C, H are allowed, T is in position 5 (invalid).

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
- O (position 2 is fixed)
- N (must appear, but NOT in positions 3 or 4)
- T (must appear, but NOT in positions 1 or 5)

So the pattern is:
_ O _ _ _

and the remaining letters must include:
- N somewhere in positions 1 or 5 (because positions 3 and 4 are excluded for N)
- T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but position 2 is already O, so positions 3 or 4)

But T cannot be in position 5 (already excluded), and cannot be in position 1 (from TONDU feedback), and position 2 is O. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, N cannot be in positions 3 or 4, so N must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible positions:

Case 1: N in position 1
Then word looks like:
N O _ _ _

Now T must be in position 3 or 4.

Subcase 1a: T in position 3
N O T _ _

Letters used so far: N, O, T
Allowed remaining letters (not yet excluded): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two more letters in positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set.

Common endings: “NOT” + ??
Possible words: NOTCH, NOTUM, NOTAL (but A excluded), etc.

“NOTCH” – C and H are allowed → N O T C H → valid.

“NOTUM” – U is allowed → N O T U M → valid.

“NOTAB” – A excluded.

So “NOTCH” is a strong candidate.

Subcase 1b: T in position 4
N O _ T _

Need a letter for position 3 from allowed set, and one for position 5.

Possible words: NOBTT – invalid (double T), NOLTS – S excluded, etc.

Seems unlikely to be a common word, so focus on Subcase 1a.

Case 2: N in position 5
Then word looks like:
_ O _ _ N

Now T must be in position 3 or 4.

Subcase 2a: T in position 3
_ O T _ N

Need letters for positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.

Common words: B O T T N – invalid, C O T T N – invalid, F O T ? N.

“COTYN” – not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to keep narrowing things down.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are ruled out).

A strong second guess would be a word that tests several of these new letters while placing O in a different position. The word ""POINT"" is attractive because:
- P, I, N, T are all common and untested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s go with POINT.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - O (and it is in position 2).
   - N (but not in position 4).
   - T (but not in position 5).

So the pattern so far looks like:
_ O _ _ _

and the remaining letters must include N and T somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but N ≠ 4, T ≠ 5).

Other letters still available (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains N and T (in allowable positions).
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

A quick scan for common words fitting _O__ _ with N and T gives “MOUNT”:
- M, U are still allowed.
- N is in position 4 (allowed because N was only excluded from position 4 in the previous guess, but that was POINT where N was in position 4 and got “-” so it’s still allowed elsewhere).
- T is in position 5, but T was excluded from position 5 in POINT (feedback T(-)), so T cannot be in position 5. Therefore MOUNT is invalid.

Next candidate: “BOUNT” – but T would again be in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “DOUNT” – same problem.

Next: “HOTEL” – but E is already excluded.

Next: “COUTH” – but U and C, H are allowed, T is in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “GONUT” – T in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “DONUT” – T in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “LONER” – E, R excluded.

Next: “MOUNT” already rejected.

Next: “BONUT” – T in 5 (invalid).

Next: “FONUT” – same.

Next: “TONIC” – O is in position 2, but T is in position 1 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), I excluded (I(x) in POINT).

Next: “TONIC” is invalid because I is excluded.

Next: “TONAL” – A excluded.

Next: “TONDE” – E excluded.

Next: “TONDU” – U allowed, but D allowed, N in 3, T in 1. This seems valid:
- T in 1 (allowed).
- O in 2 (required).
- N in 3 (allowed, since N was only excluded from 4).

Therefore MOUNT is invalid.\n\nNext candidate: “BOUNT” – but T would again be in position 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “DOUNT” – same problem.\n\nNext: “HOTEL” – but E is already excluded.\n\nNext: “COUTH” – but U and C, H are allowed, T is in position 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “GONUT” – T in position 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “DONUT” – T in position 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “FOUNT” – T in position 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “JOKUL” – J, K, L allowed, but U is allowed, but we need N and T, and this lacks N.\n\nNext: “CONUT” – C, U, N allowed, T in position 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “LONER” – E, R excluded.\n\nNext: “MOUNT” already rejected.\n\nNext: “BONUT” – T in 5 (invalid).\n\nNext: “FONUT” – same.\n\nNext: “TONIC” – O is in position 2, but T is in position 1 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), I excluded (I(x) in POINT).\n\nNext: “TONIC” is invalid because I is excluded.\n\nNext: “TONAL” – A excluded.\n\nNext: “TONDE” – E excluded.\n\nNext: “TONDU” – U allowed, but D allowed, N in 3, T in 1. This seems valid:\n- T in 1 (allowed).\n- O in 2 (required).\n- N in 3 (allowed, since N was only excluded from 4).\n- D in 4 (allowed).\n- U in 5 (allowed).\n\n“TONDU” is a valid 5-letter word (a variant spelling of “tundral” or used in some dialects/Scrabble lists).

From the feedback so far we have:

Known letters and positions:
- Position 1: N (✓)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: T (✓)

Known letters not yet placed:
- U (from TONDU feedback: U(-) – so U is in the word but not in position 5)

Excluded letters (✗): A, R, S, E, P, I, D, C, H

So the word looks like:
N O T _ _

The only remaining letter we know must be present is U, and it cannot be in position 5 (from TONDU feedback). Therefore U must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be:
N O T U _

Now we need a fifth letter for position 5 that:
- Has not been excluded (not in {A, R, S, E, P, I, D, C, H})
- Has not yet been used in this position (N, O, T, U are already used once each)

Available letters: B, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching ""NOTU_"":
- NOTUM (but M is allowed)
- NOTUS (but S is excluded)
- NOTUM is valid (rare but recognized)

Given NOTUM is the only plausible English word fitting this pattern, we'll try it.
