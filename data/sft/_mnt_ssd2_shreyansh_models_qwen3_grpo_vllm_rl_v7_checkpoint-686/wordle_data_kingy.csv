For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

These words cover frequently used letters in English and include multiple vowels. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word with good letter distribution.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains N, but not in the 5th position.  
We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.

Good next guesses should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 5).
2. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.).
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “STONY”.  
- S, T, O, Y are still possible.  
- N is moved to position 4.  
- It tests 5 new letters (S, T, O, N, Y) and keeps the game informative.

(If STONY also gives only “-” for N, we’ll know to try N in positions 1-3 next.)

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   – Letters to exclude: C, R, A, E  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and also not in position 5, from guess 1).

2. STONY → S(x) T(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)  
   – Letters to exclude: S, T, O  
   – N is still in the word but NOT in position 4 (again).  
   – Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word ends with Y.  
- It contains N, but N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, O.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried: D, L, I, U, B, M, P, G, H, K, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the still-allowed letters.

A good candidate is “UNITY” – but U, N, I, T, Y: T is already excluded.  
Another candidate is “FUNNY” – F, U, N, N, Y: N appears twice, but we don’t yet know if the word has double N. Also, F and U are still allowed.  
“FUNNY” uses N in position 3, which is allowed, and ends with Y. It introduces F and U, which haven’t been tested yet.

From the new feedback on FUNNY:

- F(x) → F is not in the word.
- U(x) → U is not in the word.
- N(✓) → the first N is in the correct position (position 3).
- N(-) → the second N is in the word but in the wrong position (so there is at least one more N elsewhere, or this N is a duplicate but already placed correctly).
- Y(✓) → Y is correctly placed at position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word has the form: _ _ N _ Y
2. It contains at least one more N somewhere in positions 1 or 2 (since the second N in position 4 is marked wrong, but the first N in position 3 is correct).
3. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, O, F, U.

Remaining allowed letters: D, L, I, B, M, P, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y with N in position 3 and another N in position 1 or 2. Possible candidates:
- D: D is allowed. Could form DN_NY, but no common words fit.
- L: L is allowed. Could form LN_NY, but no common words fit.
- B: B is allowed. Could form BN_NY, but no common words fit.
- M: M is allowed. Could form MN_NY, but no common words fit.
- G: G is allowed. Could form GN_NY, but no common words fit.
- H: H is allowed. Could form HN_NY, but no common words fit.
- K: K is allowed. Could form KN_NY, but no common words fit.
- V: V is allowed. Could form VN_NY, but no common words fit.
- W: W is allowed. Could form WN_NY, but no common words fit.

Looking for actual words, the only common word that fits _ _ N _ Y with N in position 3 and another N in position 1 or 2 is ""INNY"" (but it's only 4 letters). There's no standard 5-letter word ending in Y with N in position 3 and another N in position 1 or 2.

Wait, let's reconsider the N feedback:
- The first N in FUNNY is in position 3 and is correct.
- The second N in position 4 is marked wrong, which means there is no second N in position 4. However, the word might have another N elsewhere (positions 1 or 2) or might not have any other N (meaning the word has only one N at position 3, but the feedback for position 4's N is just confirming it's not there).

But the feedback shows N(-) for the second N in position 4, which means N is in the word but not in position 4. Since position 3 is already correct, this implies the word has only one N at position 3, and the second N in position 4 is simply being marked as wrong because it's not there. So the word has exactly one N at position 3.

Thus, the structure is: _ _ N _ Y with no other N's.

Now, possible letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining allowed: D, L, I, B, M, P, G, H, K, V, W.

Looking for common words:
- ""INNY"" is 4 letters.
- ""DINNY"" is not a word.
- ""LINNY"" is not a word.
- ""BINNY"" is not a word.
- ""MINNY"" is not a word.
- ""PINNY"" is not a word.
- ""GIMPY"" - but P is allowed, G is allowed, but this has no N in position 3.
- ""HINNY"" is not a word.
- ""WINNY"" is not a word.

Actually, ""WINNY"" is a word (slang for ""winnie the pooh""), but W is allowed, I is allowed, N is in position 3, N is in position 4 (but we know position 4 must be Y, so this doesn't fit).

Wait, the structure is _ _ N _ Y, so positions 1,2,3,4,5 are: 1,2,N,4,Y.

So possible words:
- ""DINGY"" - D, I, N, G, Y. But we ruled out I? No, I hasn't been ruled out yet. Let's check:
  - Letters used: D, I, N, G, Y.
  - D, I, G, Y are all allowed (not in excluded list).
  - This fits _ _ N _ Y.

""DINGY"" seems to be a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Ends with Y (✓).
- Has N in position 3 (✓).
- Uses only allowed letters (D, I, N, G, Y) - none of C,R,A,E,S,T,O,F,U are present.
- No excluded letters are used.

Thus, ""DINGY"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

These words cover frequently used letters in English and include multiple vowels. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word with good letter distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains N, but not in the 5th position.  
We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.

Good next guesses should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 5).
2. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.).
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “STONY”.  
- S, T, O, Y are still possible.  
- N is moved to position 4.  
- It tests 5 new letters (S, T, O, N, Y) and keeps the game informative.

(If STONY also gives only “-” for N, we’ll know to try N in positions 1-3 next.)

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   – Letters to exclude: C, R, A, E  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and also not in position 5, from guess 1).

2. STONY → S(x) T(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)  
   – Letters to exclude: S, T, O  
   – N is still in the word but NOT in position 4 (again).  
   – Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word ends with Y.  
- It contains N, but N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, O.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried: D, L, I, U, B, M, P, G, H, K, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the still-allowed letters.

A good candidate is “UNITY” – but U, N, I, T, Y: T is already excluded.  
Another candidate is “FUNNY” – F, U, N, N, Y: N appears twice, but we don’t yet know if the word has double N. Also, F and U are still allowed.  
“FUNNY” uses N in position 3, which is allowed, and ends with Y. It introduces F and U, which haven’t been tested yet.

But let's double-check: we have ruled out C, R, A, E, S, T, O, F, U, D. The remaining letters for position 1 include B, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

""W"" is still allowed, and ""WINGY"" is a valid word (though rare), so this must be the answer.

But wait, there's actually a more common word: ""HINGY"" (as in ""hinge"") but that would be H I N G Y, which is valid.

Both ""WINGY"" and ""HINGY"" fit. Between these, ""HINGY"" is slightly more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

These words cover frequently used letters in English and include multiple vowels. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word with good letter distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains N, but not in the 5th position.  
We now know to avoid C, R, A, E entirely.

Good next guesses should:
1. Include N in a different position (not 5).
2. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.).
3. Avoid C, R, A, E.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “STONY”.  
- S, T, O, Y are still possible.  
- N is moved to position 4.  
- It tests 5 new letters (S, T, O, N, Y) and keeps the game informative.

(If STONY also gives only “-” for N, we’ll know to try N in positions 1-3 next.)

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   – Letters to exclude: C, R, A, E  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and also not in position 5, from guess 1).

2. STONY → S(x) T(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)  
   – Letters to exclude: S, T, O  
   – N is still in the word but NOT in position 4 (again).  
   – Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word ends with Y.  
- It contains N, but N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, O.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried: D, L, I, U, B, M, P, G, H, K, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the still-allowed letters.

A good candidate is “UNITY” – but U, N, I, T, Y: T is already excluded.  
Another candidate is “FUNNY” – F, U, N, N, Y: N appears twice, but we don’t yet know if the word has double N. Also, F and U are still allowed.  
“FUNNY” uses N in position 3, which is allowed, and ends with Y. It introduces F and U, which haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s go with FUNNY.

Guess 3: FUNNY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(x) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on FUNNY:

- F(x) → F is not in the word.
- U(x) → U is not in the word.
- N(✓) → the first N is in the correct position (position 3).
- N(-) → the second N is in the word but in the wrong position (so there is at least one more N elsewhere, or this N is a duplicate but already placed correctly).
- Y(✓) → Y is correctly placed at position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word has the form: _ _ N _ Y
2. It contains at least one more N somewhere in positions 1 or 2 (since the second N in position 4 is marked wrong, but the first N in position 3 is correct).
3. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, O, F, U.

Remaining allowed letters: D, L, I, B, M, P, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y with N in position 3 and another N in position 1 or 2. Possible candidates:
- D: D is allowed. Could form DN_NY, but no common words fit.
- L: L is allowed. Could form LN_NY, but no common words fit.
- B: B is allowed. Could form BN_NY, but no common words fit.
- M: M is allowed. Could form MN_NY, but no common words fit.
- G: G is allowed. Could form GN_NY, but no common words fit.
- H: H is allowed. Could form HN_NY, but no common words fit.
- K: K is allowed. Could form KN_NY, but no common words fit.
- V: V is allowed. Could form VN_NY, but no common words fit.
- W: W is allowed. Could form WN_NY, but no common words fit.

Looking for actual words, the only common word that fits _ _ N _ Y with N in position 3 and another N in position 1 or 2 is ""INNY"" (but it's only 4 letters). There's no standard 5-letter word ending in Y with N in position 3 and another N in position 1 or 2.

Wait, let's reconsider the N feedback:
- The first N in FUNNY is in position 3 and is correct.
- The second N in position 4 is marked wrong, which means there is no second N in position 4. However, the word might have another N elsewhere (positions 1 or 2) or might not have any other N (meaning the word has only one N at position 3, but the feedback for position 4's N is just confirming it's not there).

But the feedback shows N(-) for the second N in position 4, which means N is in the word but not in position 4. Since position 3 is already correct, this implies the word has only one N at position 3, and the second N in position 4 is simply being marked as wrong because it's not there. So the word has exactly one N at position 3.

Thus, the structure is: _ _ N _ Y with no other N's.

Now, possible letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining allowed: D, L, I, B, M, P, G, H, K, V, W.

Looking for common words:
- ""INNY"" is 4 letters.
- ""DINNY"" is not a word.
- ""LINNY"" is not a word.
- ""BINNY"" is not a word.
- ""MINNY"" is not a word.
- ""PINNY"" is not a word.
- ""GIMPY"" - but P is allowed, G is allowed, but this has no N in position 3.
- ""HINNY"" is not a word.
- ""WINNY"" is not a word.

Actually, ""WINNY"" is a word (slang for ""winnie the pooh""), but W is allowed, I is allowed, N is in position 3, N is in position 4 (but we know position 4 must be Y, so this doesn't fit).

Wait, the structure is _ _ N _ Y, so positions 1,2,3,4,5 are: 1,2,N,4,Y.

So possible words:
- ""DINGY"" - D, I, N, G, Y. But we ruled out I? No, I hasn't been ruled out yet. Let's check:
  - Letters used: D, I, N, G, Y.
  - D, I, G, Y are all allowed (not in excluded list).
  - This fits _ _ N _ Y.

""DINGY"" seems to be a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Ends with Y (✓).
- Has N in position 3 (✓).
- Uses only allowed letters (D, I, N, G, Y) - none of C,R,A,E,S,T,O,F,U are present.
- No excluded letters are used.

Thus, ""DINGY"" is a valid next guess.

Let\'s check:\n  - Letters used: D, I, N, G, Y.\n  - D, I, G, Y are all allowed (not in excluded list).\n  - This fits _ _ N _ Y.\n\n""DINGY"" seems to be a valid word that fits all constraints.\n\nLet\'s verify:\n- Ends with Y (✓).\n- Has N in position 3 (✓).\n- Uses only allowed letters (D, I, N, G, Y) - none of C,R,A,E,S,T,O,F,U are present.\n- No excluded letters are used.\n\nThus, ""DINGY"" is a valid next guess.\n\n<guess>DINGY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: FUNNY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(x) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: DINGY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on DINGY:\n\n- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.\n- I(✓) → I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- N(✓) → N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- G(✓) → G is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo we now know the exact structure of the word:\n\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: G\nPosition 5: Y\n\nThe word must be of the form: _ I N G Y\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that ends in ""INGY"" and has no N in position 1 (since N is already in position 3). The only common English word that fits this pattern is ""WINGY"" (though ""wingy"" is somewhat archaic), but more importantly, ""SINGY"" is not a word, ""LINGY"" is not a word, ""MINGY"" is not a word, etc. \n\nHowever, the most straightforward and valid word that fits _ I N G Y is ""WINGY"". But since we have not ruled out W yet, and W hasn\'t been tested, this is a valid candidate.\n\nBut let\'s double-check: we have ruled out C, R, A, E, S, T, O, F, U, D. The remaining letters for position 1 include B, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.\n\n""W"" is still allowed, and ""WINGY"" is a valid word (though rare), so this must be the answer.\n\nBut wait, there\'s actually a more common word: ""HINGY"" (as in ""hinge"") but that would be H I N G Y, which is valid.\n\nBoth ""WINGY"" and ""HINGY"" fit. Between these, ""HINGY"" is slightly more common.\n\nBut let me verify: H is not in our excluded list, I is correct, N is correct, G is correct, Y is correct.

We now know the exact pattern:

- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: G (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

So the word is: _ I N G Y

Letters already ruled out for position 1:
C, R, A, E, S, T, O, F, U, D, H

Remaining possible first letters (from the alphabet excluding the above and including N, I, G, Y which are already placed):
B, K, L, M, P, V, W

Looking at valid 5-letter English words ending in ""INGY"":

- BINGY – not a standard word
- K… – no common word
- L… – no common word
- M… – no common word
- P… – no common word
- V… – no common word
- W… – ""WINGY"" is valid (though rare)

However, ""WINGY"" is actually recognized in some dictionaries as an archaic or dialectal form, but it is the only candidate left.

But wait – let's reconsider the earlier interpretation. The feedback on FUNNY showed N(-) for the second N in position 4, which we interpreted as ""N is in the word but not in position 4"". However, since position 3 was already marked ✓, this simply confirms the single N is at position 3. This does not preclude other letters from repeating, but no evidence suggests another N.

The key realization is that DINGY gave us four letters in their correct places, leaving only the first letter unknown. Since HINGY was the next guess and it failed at position 1, the only remaining letter that forms a valid word is W.

Thus, the secret word must be ""WINGY"".
