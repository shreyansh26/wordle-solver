For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain.

Popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. One approach is to pick common consonants and vowels that remain available. The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out). We already know O is in position 3, so we can use I, U, or Y elsewhere.

A good next guess should test new common letters. Let’s try ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: must be in the word (and position 1 is allowed since R was not in position 2)
- O: correct in position 3
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests F, N, T while keeping R and O in valid positions.

From the latest feedback (TORCH):

- T(✓) → T is in the word AND in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback that O was in position 3).  
  Wait – this is impossible. The feedback for TORCH says O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3, yet earlier feedback (AROSE) said O(✓) meaning O is in position 3. These two pieces of feedback are mutually exclusive: O cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also not in position 3.  

Therefore, the feedback provided must contain an inconsistency. The only way both statements can be true is if the secret word is “TO…O…”, but English 5-letter words rarely have two O’s in positions 1 and 3. The most likely explanation is that the feedback for TORCH contains a typo and the symbol for position 3 should have been ✓ instead of –.  

Assuming the feedback for TORCH is correct as given (T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)), we must reconcile this with the earlier feedback:

1. From AROSE: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.

2. From FRONT: F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3, T is in the word but not in position 5.

3. From TORCH: T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)  
   ⇒ T is in position 1, O is in the word but not in position 3, R is in the word but not in position 3, C is not in the word, H is in the word but not in position 5.

The contradiction is that O cannot simultaneously be in position 3 (from AROSE and FRONT) and not in position 3 (from TORCH). Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted with the understanding that the symbol for position 3 in TORCH should have been ✓. I will proceed under the corrected assumption that O is indeed in position 3, and the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 is a typo.

Revised knowledge:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from FRONT and TORCH), so R must be in position 4 or 5.
- H is in the word but NOT in position 5, so H must be in position 2 or 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, E, F, S, N, C.

Pattern: T _ O _ _ with R in 4 or 5 and H in 2 or 4.

Possible placements:
- If R is in position 4, then H must be in position 2.
- If R is in position 5, then H can be in position 2 or 4 (but 4 would then be empty, so H must be in 2).

Thus, two possible patterns:
1. T H O R _
2. T _ O R H (but H cannot be in 5, so this is invalid)

Therefore, the word must be T H O R _ with the fifth letter being any remaining allowed letter (not A, E, F, S, N, C). Remaining common letters: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid English word fitting T H O R _ is “THORP” (though rare) or “THORN” (but N is forbidden). “THORP” is a valid variant spelling of “thorp”. Another possibility is “THORK” (a surname). However, the most common English word fitting this pattern is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. Thus, “THORP” is the best candidate.

But let’s verify:
- T in 1 (✓)

- P in 5 (new, not forbidden)

This satisfies all constraints.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain.

Popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Contains R (but not in position 2).
3. Does not contain A, S, or E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, E).

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. One approach is to pick common consonants and vowels that remain available. The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out). We already know O is in position 3, so we can use I, U, or Y elsewhere.

A good next guess should test new common letters. Let’s try ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: must be in the word (and position 1 is allowed since R was not in position 2)
- O: correct in position 3
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests F, N, T while keeping R and O in valid positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from both guesses) and NOT in position 1 (from FRONT), so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  But position 3 is already O, so R must be in position 4 or 5.
3. T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from FRONT), so T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Position 3 is O, so T must be in 1, 2, or 4.
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, E, F, S, N.

So the pattern looks like: _ _ O _ _ with R somewhere in 4 or 5 and T somewhere in 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
- O in position 3
- R in position 4 or 5
- T in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not conflicting with R)
- No A, E, F, S, N

A good candidate is “TORCH”:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (required)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- C and H are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This tests C and H while placing T and R in allowable positions.

The only standard English word that fits is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. This suggests we may have made an error earlier, but rechecking the constraints:

- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: R (✓)
- Position 5: must be a letter not in {A, E, F, N, S, C, P}

Given this, “THOR_” with standard dictionaries yields no valid 5-letter word. This implies the feedback for TORCH must have been interpreted incorrectly. Re-examining TORCH feedback:

Original feedback: T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)

If we strictly take this literally:
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (–)
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (–)
- C is not in the word (x)
- H is in the word but not in position 5 (–)

This creates a contradiction with AROSE’s O(✓). The only consistent resolution is that the TORCH feedback’s position 3 symbol was intended to be ✓, i.e., the feedback was meant to be:

T(✓) O(✓) R(-) C(x) H(-)

In that case, the constraints are:
- T in 1 (✓)

If R is in 4, then H must be in 2:

If R is in 5, then H must be in 2 or 4, but 4 would be empty, so H in 2:
T H O _ R

Looking for words:
- T H O R _ → THORP (invalid, P forbidden)
- T H O _ R → THOKR (invalid), THORR (invalid), THOTR (invalid)

This suggests the only possible word is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. This indicates the feedback must have been intended differently. Given the contradiction, the most plausible word fitting all constraints is “THORN” despite N being marked x in FRONT. Rechecking FRONT feedback: FRONT → F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-) shows N was indeed marked x, so “THORN” is impossible.

This leaves us with no standard word, indicating an inconsistency in feedback. However, assuming the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 was meant to be ✓, and accepting that the word must be “THORN” (despite N being x), or that the feedback may contain an error, the closest valid word is “THORP” but P was marked x.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain.

Popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Contains R (but not in position 2).
3. Does not contain A, S, or E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, E).

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. One approach is to pick common consonants and vowels that remain available. The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out). We already know O is in position 3, so we can use I, U, or Y elsewhere.

A good next guess should test new common letters. Let’s try ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: must be in the word (and position 1 is allowed since R was not in position 2)
- O: correct in position 3
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests F, N, T while keeping R and O in valid positions.

Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from both guesses) and NOT in position 1 (from FRONT), so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  But position 3 is already O, so R must be in position 4 or 5.
3. T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from FRONT), so T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Position 3 is O, so T must be in 1, 2, or 4.
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, E, F, S, N.

So the pattern looks like: _ _ O _ _ with R somewhere in 4 or 5 and T somewhere in 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
- O in position 3
- R in position 4 or 5
- T in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not conflicting with R)
- No A, E, F, S, N

A good candidate is “TORCH”:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (required)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- C and H are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This tests C and H while placing T and R in allowable positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the latest feedback (TORCH):

- T(✓) → T is in the word AND in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback that O was in position 3).  
  Wait – this is impossible. The feedback for TORCH says O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3, yet earlier feedback (AROSE) said O(✓) meaning O is in position 3. These two pieces of feedback are mutually exclusive: O cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also not in position 3.  

Therefore, the feedback provided must contain an inconsistency. The only way both statements can be true is if the secret word is “TO…O…”, but English 5-letter words rarely have two O’s in positions 1 and 3. The most likely explanation is that the feedback for TORCH contains a typo and the symbol for position 3 should have been ✓ instead of –.  

Assuming the feedback for TORCH is correct as given (T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)), we must reconcile this with the earlier feedback:

1. From AROSE: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.

2. From FRONT: F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3, T is in the word but not in position 5.

3. From TORCH: T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)  
   ⇒ T is in position 1, O is in the word but not in position 3, R is in the word but not in position 3, C is not in the word, H is in the word but not in position 5.

The contradiction is that O cannot simultaneously be in position 3 (from AROSE and FRONT) and not in position 3 (from TORCH). Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted with the understanding that the symbol for position 3 in TORCH should have been ✓. I will proceed under the corrected assumption that O is indeed in position 3, and the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 is a typo.

Revised knowledge:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from FRONT and TORCH), so R must be in position 4 or 5.
- H is in the word but NOT in position 5, so H must be in position 2 or 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, E, F, S, N, C.

Pattern: T _ O _ _ with R in 4 or 5 and H in 2 or 4.

Possible placements:
- If R is in position 4, then H must be in position 2.
- If R is in position 5, then H can be in position 2 or 4 (but 4 would then be empty, so H must be in 2).

Thus, two possible patterns:
1. T H O R _
2. T _ O R H (but H cannot be in 5, so this is invalid)

Therefore, the word must be T H O R _ with the fifth letter being any remaining allowed letter (not A, E, F, S, N, C). Remaining common letters: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid English word fitting T H O R _ is “THORP” (though rare) or “THORN” (but N is forbidden). “THORP” is a valid variant spelling of “thorp”. Another possibility is “THORK” (a surname). However, the most common English word fitting this pattern is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. Thus, “THORP” is the best candidate.

But let’s verify:
- T in 1 (✓)
- H in 2 (new)
- O in 3 (✓)
- R in 4 (new)
- P in 5 (new, not forbidden)

This satisfies all constraints.

Given this, “THOR_” with standard dictionaries yields no valid 5-letter word. This implies the feedback for TORCH must have been interpreted incorrectly. Re-examining TORCH feedback:

Original feedback: T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)

If we strictly take this literally:

- O is in the word but not in position 3 (–)
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (–)
- C is not in the word (x)
- H is in the word but not in position 5 (–)

This creates a contradiction with AROSE’s O(✓). The only consistent resolution is that the TORCH feedback’s position 3 symbol was intended to be ✓, i.e., the feedback was meant to be:

T(✓) O(✓) R(-) C(x) H(-)

In that case, the constraints are:

Looking for words:

- T H O _ R → THOKR (invalid), THORR (invalid), THOTR (invalid)

This suggests the only possible word is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. This indicates the feedback must have been intended differently. Given the contradiction, the most plausible word fitting all constraints is “THORN” despite N being marked x in FRONT. Rechecking FRONT feedback: FRONT → F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-) shows N was indeed marked x, so “THORN” is impossible.

This leaves us with no standard word, indicating an inconsistency in feedback. However, assuming the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 was meant to be ✓, and accepting that the word must be “THORN” (despite N being x), or that the feedback may contain an error, the closest valid word is “THORP” but P was marked x.

Possible letters left: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Testing “THOR_” with remaining letters:
- THORB – invalid

- THORK – surname, but uncommon
- THORL – invalid
- THORM – invalid
- THORU – invalid
- THORV – invalid

Given this, the only plausible resolution is that the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 was intended to be ✓, and the word is “THORN” despite N being marked x in FRONT. This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback provided. However, proceeding with the only possible word:

The word must be “THORN”, but N is forbidden. Therefore, the feedback must contain an error. Assuming the feedback for FRONT’s N was a typo and N is actually allowed, the word is “THORN”.

Given the constraints, the correct word is:

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.\n\nSome of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain.\n\nPopular starting words include:\n- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)\n- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)\n- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving me good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.\n- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.\n- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 3.\n- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.\n- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has O in position 3.\n- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2.\n- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

One approach is to pick common consonants and vowels that remain available. The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out). We already know O is in position 3, so we can use I, U, or Y elsewhere.\n\nA good next guess should test new common letters.

The feedback for TORCH says O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3, yet earlier feedback (AROSE) said O(✓) meaning O is in position 3. These two pieces of feedback are mutually exclusive: O cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also not in position 3.  \n\nTherefore, the feedback provided must contain an inconsistency. The only way both statements can be true is if the secret word is “TO…O…”, but English 5-letter words rarely have two O’s in positions 1 and 3. The most likely explanation is that the feedback for TORCH contains a typo and the symbol for position 3 should have been ✓ instead of –.  \n\nAssuming the feedback for TORCH is correct as given (T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)), we must reconcile this with the earlier feedback:\n\n1.

Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted with the understanding that the symbol for position 3 in TORCH should have been ✓. I will proceed under the corrected assumption that O is indeed in position 3, and the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 is a typo.\n\nRevised knowledge:\n- Position 1: T (✓)\n- Position 3: O (✓)\n- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from FRONT and TORCH), so R must be in position 4 or 5.\n- H is in the word but NOT in position 5, so H must be in position 2 or 4.\n- Forbidden letters: A, E, F, S, N, C.\n\nPattern: T _ O _ _ with R in 4 or 5 and H in 2 or 4.\n\nPossible placements:\n- If R is in position 4, then H must be in position 2.\n- If R is in position 5, then H can be in position 2 or 4 (but 4 would then be empty, so H must be in 2).\n\nThus, two possible patterns:\n1. T H O R _\n2. T _ O R H (but H cannot be in 5, so this is invalid)\n\nTherefore, the word must be T H O R _ with the fifth letter being any remaining allowed letter (not A, E, F, S, N, C). Remaining common letters: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nA valid English word fitting T H O R _ is “THORP” (though rare) or “THORN” (but N is forbidden). “THORP” is a valid variant spelling of “thorp”. Another possibility is “THORK” (a surname). However, the most common English word fitting this pattern is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. Thus, “THORP” is the best candidate.\n\nBut let’s verify:\n- T in 1 (✓)\n- H in 2 (new)\n- O in 3 (✓)\n- R in 4 (new)\n- P in 5 (new, not forbidden)\n\nThis satisfies all constraints.\n\n<guess>THORP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: TORCH -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)\nGuess 4: THORP -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) O(✓) R(✓) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on THORP:\n\n- T(✓) – T is correct in position 1\n- H(✓) – H is correct in position 2\n- O(✓) – O is correct in position 3\n- R(✓) – R is correct in position 4\n- P(x) – P is not in the word\n\nSo the word is now fully determined except for the last letter.

This implies the feedback for TORCH must have been interpreted incorrectly. Re-examining TORCH feedback:\n\nOriginal feedback: T(✓) O(-) R(-) C(x) H(-)\n\nIf we strictly take this literally:\n- T is in position 1 (✓)\n- O is in the word but not in position 3 (–)\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (–)\n- C is not in the word (x)\n- H is in the word but not in position 5 (–)\n\nThis creates a contradiction with AROSE’s O(✓). The only consistent resolution is that the TORCH feedback’s position 3 symbol was intended to be ✓, i.e., the feedback was meant to be:\n\nT(✓) O(✓) R(-) C(x) H(-)\n\nIn that case, the constraints are:\n- T in 1 (✓)\n- O in 3 (✓)\n- R in 4 or 5 (–)\n- H in 2 or 4 (–)\n- Forbidden: A, E, F, S, N, C\n\nPattern: T _ O _ _\n\nWith R in 4 or 5 and H in 2 or 4.\n\nIf R is in 4, then H must be in 2:\nT H O R _\n\nIf R is in 5, then H must be in 2 or 4, but 4 would be empty, so H in 2:\nT H O _ R\n\nLooking for words:\n- T H O R _ → THORP (invalid, P forbidden)\n- T H O _ R → THOKR (invalid), THORR (invalid), THOTR (invalid)\n\nThis suggests the only possible word is “THORN”, but N is forbidden. This indicates the feedback must have been intended differently. Given the contradiction, the most plausible word fitting all constraints is “THORN” despite N being marked x in FRONT. Rechecking FRONT feedback: FRONT → F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(-) shows N was indeed marked x, so “THORN” is impossible.\n\nThis leaves us with no standard word, indicating an inconsistency in feedback. However, assuming the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 was meant to be ✓, and accepting that the word must be “THORN” (despite N being x), or that the feedback may contain an error, the closest valid word is “THORP” but P was marked x. \n\nReconstructing with strict constraints:\n- T _ O _ _\n- R in 4 or 5\n- H in 2 or 4\n- Forbidden: A, E, F, S, N, C, P\n\nPossible letters left: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nTesting “THOR_” with remaining letters:\n- THORB – invalid\n- THORD – invalid\n- THORI – invalid\n- THORK – surname, but uncommon\n- THORL – invalid\n- THORM – invalid\n- THORU – invalid\n- THORV – invalid\n- THORW – invalid\n- THORX – invalid\n- THORY – invalid\n\nGiven this, the only plausible resolution is that the feedback for TORCH’s position 3 was intended to be ✓, and the word is “THORN” despite N being marked x in FRONT.
