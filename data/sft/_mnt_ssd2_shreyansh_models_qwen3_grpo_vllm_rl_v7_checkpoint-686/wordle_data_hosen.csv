For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good letter distribution. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

The letters in AROSE are:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   – A, R are not in the word.
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in the positions guessed.

2. HOUSE → H(✓) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(-)
   – H is correct in position 1.
   – O is correct in position 2.
   – U is not in the word.
   – S, E are still in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: H O _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: S, E (and they must be in positions 3 or 5, since 4 and 5 were ruled out for E and S respectively).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, U.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE) or 4 (from HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in 5 (from HOUSE), and from AROSE it also cannot be in 5, so E must be in 3.

Thus:
- E must be in position 3.
- S must then be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 4 and 3 is taken by E).

So the word is: H O E S _

The last letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching H O E S _. The most common is HOES_, but we need a valid word. ""HOES"" is 4 letters. ""HOESY"" is not common. Actually, ""HOES"" is not valid. Let me think again.

Wait, the pattern is H O E S _, so possible words: HOES_, but we need a 5-letter word. The only common word I can think of is ""HOES"" plus a letter, but none seem common. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me re-examine:
- H is correct in 1.
- O is correct in 2.
- E must be in 3 (since it can't be in 5).
- S must be in 5 (since it can't be in 4 and 3 is taken by E).
- Position 4 must be a new letter, not A, R, U.

So the word is H O E S ?. The only possible 5-letter word is ""HOES"" plus a letter, but none seem valid. Maybe I missed another possibility.

Wait, maybe E is in position 4? Let me check:
From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From HOUSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
So E could be in 1,2,3,4. But positions 1,2 are H,O. So E must be in 3 or 4.

Similarly, S is in word but not in 4 (AROSE) and not in 4 (HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5. But if E is in 3 or 4, then S must be in 5.

So possible patterns:
1. H O E S _ (but no valid word)
2. H O _ E S (this seems possible)

Let me check this:
- H O _ E S
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out (not A, R, U).
Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y.

Looking for common words: H O _ E S.
Possible: HOSES (but S is repeated), HOMES, HONES, HOPES, HOTES, etc.

""HOMES"" is a valid word: H O M E S.
Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- H(✓) in 1, O(✓) in 2, M(new), E in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).
- No A, R, U.
- All letters are valid.

Thus, the next guess should be HOMES.

Based on the feedback, we now know:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good letter distribution. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

The letters in AROSE are:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R.
- Letters definitely present: O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Next guess should:
1. Include O, S, E in new positions.
2. Avoid A and R.
3. Introduce new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good candidates: “POSED”, “SPOKE”, “SHEET”, “HOUSE”.

- HOUSE: uses O and S/E in new spots, adds H and U.
- SPOKE: uses O, S, E, adds P and K.

I’ll choose HOUSE because it spreads the known letters and introduces two new vowels/consonants (H, U).

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   – A, R are not in the word.
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in the positions guessed.

2. HOUSE → H(✓) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(-)
   – H is correct in position 1.
   – O is correct in position 2.
   – U is not in the word.
   – S, E are still in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: H O _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: S, E (and they must be in positions 3 or 5, since 4 and 5 were ruled out for E and S respectively).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, U.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE) or 4 (from HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in 5 (from HOUSE), and from AROSE it also cannot be in 5, so E must be in 3.

Thus:
- E must be in position 3.
- S must then be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 4 and 3 is taken by E).

So the word is: H O E S _

The last letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching H O E S _. The most common is HOES_, but we need a valid word. ""HOES"" is 4 letters. ""HOESY"" is not common. Actually, ""HOES"" is not valid. Let me think again.

Wait, the pattern is H O E S _, so possible words: HOES_, but we need a 5-letter word. The only common word I can think of is ""HOES"" plus a letter, but none seem common. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me re-examine:
- H is correct in 1.
- O is correct in 2.
- E must be in 3 (since it can't be in 5).
- S must be in 5 (since it can't be in 4 and 3 is taken by E).
- Position 4 must be a new letter, not A, R, U.

So the word is H O E S ?. The only possible 5-letter word is ""HOES"" plus a letter, but none seem valid. Maybe I missed another possibility.

Wait, maybe E is in position 4? Let me check:
From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From HOUSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
So E could be in 1,2,3,4. But positions 1,2 are H,O. So E must be in 3 or 4.

Similarly, S is in word but not in 4 (AROSE) and not in 4 (HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5. But if E is in 3 or 4, then S must be in 5.

So possible patterns:
1. H O E S _ (but no valid word)
2. H O _ E S (this seems possible)

Let me check this:
- H O _ E S
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out (not A, R, U).
Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y.

Looking for common words: H O _ E S.
Possible: HOSES (but S is repeated), HOMES, HONES, HOPES, HOTES, etc.

""HOMES"" is a valid word: H O M E S.
Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- H(✓) in 1, O(✓) in 2, M(new), E in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).
- No A, R, U.
- All letters are valid.

Thus, the next guess should be HOMES.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with HO.
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 5).
- S must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4).
- Position 3 must be a new letter, not A, R, or U.

This gives us the pattern: H O _ E S. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is ""HOMES"".

The letters in AROSE are:
- A: very common vowel

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good letter distribution. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

The letters in AROSE are:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R.
- Letters definitely present: O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Next guess should:
1. Include O, S, E in new positions.
2. Avoid A and R.
3. Introduce new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good candidates: “POSED”, “SPOKE”, “SHEET”, “HOUSE”.

- HOUSE: uses O and S/E in new spots, adds H and U.
- SPOKE: uses O, S, E, adds P and K.

I’ll choose HOUSE because it spreads the known letters and introduces two new vowels/consonants (H, U).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   – A, R are not in the word.
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in the positions guessed.

2. HOUSE → H(✓) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(-)
   – H is correct in position 1.
   – O is correct in position 2.
   – U is not in the word.
   – S, E are still in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: H O _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: S, E (and they must be in positions 3 or 5, since 4 and 5 were ruled out for E and S respectively).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, U.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE) or 4 (from HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in 5 (from HOUSE), and from AROSE it also cannot be in 5, so E must be in 3.

Thus:
- E must be in position 3.
- S must then be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 4 and 3 is taken by E).

So the word is: H O E S _

The last letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching H O E S _. The most common is HOES_, but we need a valid word. ""HOES"" is 4 letters. ""HOESY"" is not common. Actually, ""HOES"" is not valid. Let me think again.

Wait, the pattern is H O E S _, so possible words: HOES_, but we need a 5-letter word. The only common word I can think of is ""HOES"" plus a letter, but none seem common. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me re-examine:
- H is correct in 1.
- O is correct in 2.
- E must be in 3 (since it can't be in 5).
- S must be in 5 (since it can't be in 4 and 3 is taken by E).
- Position 4 must be a new letter, not A, R, U.

So the word is H O E S ?. The only possible 5-letter word is ""HOES"" plus a letter, but none seem valid. Maybe I missed another possibility.

Wait, maybe E is in position 4? Let me check:
From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From HOUSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
So E could be in 1,2,3,4. But positions 1,2 are H,O. So E must be in 3 or 4.

Similarly, S is in word but not in 4 (AROSE) and not in 4 (HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5. But if E is in 3 or 4, then S must be in 5.

So possible patterns:
1. H O E S _ (but no valid word)
2. H O _ E S (this seems possible)

Let me check this:
- H O _ E S
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out (not A, R, U).
Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y.

Looking for common words: H O _ E S.
Possible: HOSES (but S is repeated), HOMES, HONES, HOPES, HOTES, etc.

""HOMES"" is a valid word: H O M E S.
Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- H(✓) in 1, O(✓) in 2, M(new), E in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).
- No A, R, U.
- All letters are valid.

Thus, the next guess should be HOMES.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with HO.
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 5).
- S must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4).
- Position 3 must be a new letter, not A, R, or U.

This gives us the pattern: H O _ E S. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is ""HOMES"".

However, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.\n\nThe letters in AROSE are:\n- A: very common vowel\n- R: common consonant\n- O: common vowel\n- S: very common consonant\n- E: most common vowel in English\n\nThis should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters definitely absent: A, R.\n- Letters definitely present: O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

So E must be in 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, S is in word but not in 4 (AROSE) and not in 4 (HOUSE), so S must be in 3 or 5. But if E is in 3 or 4, then S must be in 5.\n\nSo possible patterns:\n1.

We now have five rounds of feedback.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   – Absent: A, R
   – Present but wrong place: O, S, E

2. HOUSE → H(✓) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(-)
   – Correct: H(1), O(2)
   – Absent: U
   – Present but wrong place: S, E

3. HOMES → H(✓) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(-)
   – Correct: H(1), O(2), E(4)
   – Absent: M
   – Present but wrong place: S

4. HOSED → H(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓) D(x)
   – Correct: H(1), O(2), S(3), E(4)
   – Absent: D

5. HOSES → H(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓) S(-)
   – Correct: H(1), O(2), S(3), E(4)
   – Present but wrong place: S(5)

So the pattern is:
H O S E _

Position 5 must be a letter that is:
- Not any of A, R, M, U, D (already ruled out)
- And must be different from S (because S(-) at position 5 means S is in the word but not at 5)

Looking at common consonants still allowed: B, C, F, G, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y.

The only common 5-letter word that fits H O S E _ is ""HOSES"" (but S is already at position 3 and can't be at 5), so we need another letter.

Valid words:
- HOSES (invalid, S repeated and position 5 conflict)
- HOSES is the only common one, but it's invalid.

Looking again, ""HOSES"" is actually the only possible form, but since S can't be at 5, there must be another letter. However, no other common 5-letter word fits H O S E _ except ""HOSES"".

This suggests that the word must be ""HOSES"" despite the S at position 5 being marked as wrong place, implying S must appear only once. This seems like a contradiction, so I must have missed something.

Wait, the feedback for HOSES shows S(-) at position 5, meaning S is in the word but not at 5. Since S is already correctly placed at 3, this implies the word has two S's. This is allowed in Wordle.

Thus, the word is HOSES.
