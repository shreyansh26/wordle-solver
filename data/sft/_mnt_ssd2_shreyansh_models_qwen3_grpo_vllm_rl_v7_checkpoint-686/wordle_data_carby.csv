### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N). This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include:\n- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)\n- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N).

We now have:

C A R B _

Letters ruled out so far: N, E, S, O  
Letters confirmed in positions 1-4: C, A, R, B

We need a single letter for position 5 that has not appeared in any guess and is not among N, E, S, O.

Unused letters (common ones): D, K, L, M, T, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter English words starting with CARB:
- CARBS – S is out
- CARBO – O is out
- CARBY – not standard
- CARBD – not standard
- CARBM – not standard
- CARBT – not standard

The only real word left is CARBY, but it’s not standard. However, “carby” is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic or dialectal form of “carbone” (now rare). Since we have no other valid options and the game likely accepts CARBY, I’ll try it.

But wait—let me double-check standard dictionaries. Standard Scrabble/Wordle lists:
- CARBS
- CARBO
- CARBY – accepted in some lists but uncommon

Actually, the most common valid word left is “CARBY” in standard word lists.

So I’ll guess CARBY.
