For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique, high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and it eliminates many words that don't contain these letters.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly different letters (O vs. L and T).

So my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)

Among these, ""ABIDE"" is a strong choice because it uses B, I, D, E (but E is eliminated), so actually not. Let me pick ""ALIGN"" - it uses L, I, G, N, none of which are eliminated.

Wait, ""ALIGN"" has L, I, G, N - all allowed. But maybe better to test more letters. ""AMBLE"" has M, B, L, E - but E is out. 

""ANTIC"" has N, T, I, C - all allowed. ""APHID"" has P, H, I, D - also good.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: A _ I _ _
2. Letters confirmed absent: R, O, S, E, L
3. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - G is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 4.
   - N is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5.

Available letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the available set, and position 4 must be G or N (since both must appear somewhere), but they cannot be in their previous positions.

Possible placements:
- G cannot be in position 4 (from ALIGN feedback), so G must be in position 2 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 5 (from ALIGN feedback), so N must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list possible words:
- A N I G _  → but N cannot be in position 2 (since N was in position 5 in ALIGN and feedback said N is in word but wrong position, so N can be in 2 or 4). So ANIG_ is possible.
- A N I _ G → N in position 2, G in position 5. This satisfies both constraints (N not in 5, G not in 4).
- A G I N _ → G in position 2, N in position 4. This also satisfies constraints.
- A G I _ N → G in position 2, N in position 5 → but N cannot be in 5, so invalid.

So valid patterns:
1. A N I G _
2. A N I _ G
3. A G I N _

Now, fill the remaining blank with available letters (B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words:
- ANIG_ → ANIGB, ANIGC, etc. but ANIGB is not a valid word.
- ANI_G → ANI3G, but need valid 5-letter words. ANIKG? No.
- AGING → A G I N G → but G is repeated, which is allowed, and ""AGING"" is a valid word.

Another option: ANGIN → but ""ANGIN"" is not a valid word.
Another: AGING → valid.
Another: ANKGI → invalid.
Another: ANDIG → invalid.

""AGING"" fits perfectly:
- A(✓) G(?) I(✓) N(?) G(?)
But we already know G must appear once (from G(-) in ALIGN), and N must appear once (from N(-) in ALIGN). So ""AGING"" has two G's, which might not be correct.

Better option: ANGIN → invalid.
Another: ANIKI → invalid.
Another: ANIPT → invalid.

Wait, let's think differently. We have:
Positions: A _ I _ _
Letters to place: G and N, plus one more letter from available.

From the patterns:
- A N I G _ → need a 5th letter, but we've used A, N, I, G. Need one more. But we only have one more position (position 5). So ANIG_ → need a letter for position 5, but we've already placed G in 4. So ANIG_ would require position 5 to be a new letter, but we've already used A, N, I, G. So ANIGB is invalid (not a word).

Actually, the word must contain both G and N, and possibly another letter. The simplest valid word that fits is ""AGING"", even with the double G, because it's a valid word and satisfies:
- A(✓) _ I(✓) _ _
- G appears (position 2 or 5)
- N appears (position 4)

But ""AGING"" has G in positions 2 and 5, which might not be correct as we don't know if G appears once or twice.

Better: ""ANGEL"" → but E is eliminated.
""ANKLE"" → E is eliminated.
""ANTIG"" → but G is in position 4 (invalid from ALIGN feedback).

Wait, let's try ""AGING"" anyway as it's the closest valid word fitting constraints.

But actually, let's find a word with single G and single N:
Pattern: A _ I _ _
Must include G and N, and one more letter.

Possible: A N I G _ → need position 5. Valid word: ""ANIG_"" doesn't exist.
A G I N _ → need position 5. Valid word: ""AGING"" (as above).

Another approach: use ""AMING"" → but M is allowed, and ""AMING"" is not a word.
""APHIN"" → not a word.

The valid word seems to be ""AGING"".

But let's verify:
- A(✓) _ I(✓) _ _
- G must be in word (from G(-)), and can be in position 2 or 5.
- N must be in word (from N(-)), and can be in position 2 or 4.
- ""AGING"" has:
   - A(✓) G(?) I(✓) N(?) G(?)
   - G appears in 2 and 5, N in 4.
   - This satisfies both G and N being in the word, and positions not conflicting with previous feedback.

Thus, ""AGING"" is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique, high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and it eliminates many words that don't contain these letters.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly different letters (O vs. L and T).

So my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- R, O, S, E are all absent from the word (x)

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

We now need a 5-letter word that starts with A and does not contain R, O, S, or E.

Common letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Good candidates should use several of these to maximize information. Words like:
- ABIDE
- ACHIE
- ALIGN
- ALBUM
- AMBLE
- ANGEL
- ANTIC
- APHID
- AVOID
- AWFUL

Among these, ""ABIDE"" is a strong choice because it uses B, I, D, E (but E is eliminated), so actually not. Let me pick ""ALIGN"" - it uses L, I, G, N, none of which are eliminated.

Wait, ""ALIGN"" has L, I, G, N - all allowed. But maybe better to test more letters. ""AMBLE"" has M, B, L, E - but E is out. 

""ANTIC"" has N, T, I, C - all allowed. ""APHID"" has P, H, I, D - also good.

I'll go with ""ALIGN"" as it tests L, I, G, N in one shot.

Guess 2: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) I(✓) G(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: A _ I _ _
2. Letters confirmed absent: R, O, S, E, L
3. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - G is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 4.
   - N is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5.

Available letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the available set, and position 4 must be G or N (since both must appear somewhere), but they cannot be in their previous positions.

Possible placements:
- G cannot be in position 4 (from ALIGN feedback), so G must be in position 2 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 5 (from ALIGN feedback), so N must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list possible words:
- A N I G _  → but N cannot be in position 2 (since N was in position 5 in ALIGN and feedback said N is in word but wrong position, so N can be in 2 or 4). So ANIG_ is possible.
- A N I _ G → N in position 2, G in position 5. This satisfies both constraints (N not in 5, G not in 4).
- A G I N _ → G in position 2, N in position 4. This also satisfies constraints.
- A G I _ N → G in position 2, N in position 5 → but N cannot be in 5, so invalid.

So valid patterns:
1. A N I G _
2. A N I _ G
3. A G I N _

Now, fill the remaining blank with available letters (B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words:
- ANIG_ → ANIGB, ANIGC, etc. but ANIGB is not a valid word.
- ANI_G → ANI3G, but need valid 5-letter words. ANIKG? No.
- AGING → A G I N G → but G is repeated, which is allowed, and ""AGING"" is a valid word.

Another option: ANGIN → but ""ANGIN"" is not a valid word.
Another: AGING → valid.
Another: ANKGI → invalid.
Another: ANDIG → invalid.

""AGING"" fits perfectly:
- A(✓) G(?) I(✓) N(?) G(?)
But we already know G must appear once (from G(-) in ALIGN), and N must appear once (from N(-) in ALIGN). So ""AGING"" has two G's, which might not be correct.

Better option: ANGIN → invalid.
Another: ANIKI → invalid.
Another: ANIPT → invalid.

Wait, let's think differently. We have:
Positions: A _ I _ _
Letters to place: G and N, plus one more letter from available.

From the patterns:
- A N I G _ → need a 5th letter, but we've used A, N, I, G. Need one more. But we only have one more position (position 5). So ANIG_ → need a letter for position 5, but we've already placed G in 4. So ANIG_ would require position 5 to be a new letter, but we've already used A, N, I, G. So ANIGB is invalid (not a word).

Actually, the word must contain both G and N, and possibly another letter. The simplest valid word that fits is ""AGING"", even with the double G, because it's a valid word and satisfies:
- A(✓) _ I(✓) _ _
- G appears (position 2 or 5)
- N appears (position 4)

But ""AGING"" has G in positions 2 and 5, which might not be correct as we don't know if G appears once or twice.

Better: ""ANGEL"" → but E is eliminated.
""ANKLE"" → E is eliminated.
""ANTIG"" → but G is in position 4 (invalid from ALIGN feedback).

Wait, let's try ""AGING"" anyway as it's the closest valid word fitting constraints.

But actually, let's find a word with single G and single N:
Pattern: A _ I _ _
Must include G and N, and one more letter.

Possible: A N I G _ → need position 5. Valid word: ""ANIG_"" doesn't exist.
A G I N _ → need position 5. Valid word: ""AGING"" (as above).

Another approach: use ""AMING"" → but M is allowed, and ""AMING"" is not a word.
""APHIN"" → not a word.

The valid word seems to be ""AGING"".

But let's verify:
- A(✓) _ I(✓) _ _
- G must be in word (from G(-)), and can be in position 2 or 5.
- N must be in word (from N(-)), and can be in position 2 or 4.
- ""AGING"" has:
   - A(✓) G(?) I(✓) N(?) G(?)
   - G appears in 2 and 5, N in 4.
   - This satisfies both G and N being in the word, and positions not conflicting with previous feedback.

Thus, ""AGING"" is the best next guess.
