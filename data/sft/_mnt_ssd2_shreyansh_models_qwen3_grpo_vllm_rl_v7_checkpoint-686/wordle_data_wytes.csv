For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear frequently in English words. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S and E in different positions than in AROSE (S was 4th, E was 5th).

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word that uses S and E plus common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""LINES"":
- L, I, N, E, S.
- S is now 5th (was 4th), E is now 4th (was 5th) – both moved.
- Uses L, I, N which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- No A, R, or O.

3. Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, P, T, W, Y, plus any vowels not yet excluded (only E is confirmed in position 4; we still need to test other vowels in positions 1-3 if needed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ES” that uses only allowed letters in positions 1-3.  
Possible endings are already fixed as E S, so focus on the first three letters.

Quick scan of common words ending in “ES” that avoid all excluded letters:

- BIKES – I is excluded ❌
- BUSES – U is excluded ❌
- DWEES – W, D, E, E, S – but double E is okay, and none of these letters are excluded.  
   Pattern: D W E E S – but position 3 would be E, which is already in position 4.  
   However, the word must have exactly 5 distinct positions, and E is allowed to appear twice as long as it’s in the correct final positions.  
   “DWEES” is a valid word (though rare), but let’s look for more common ones.

Another candidate: “H” + “Y” + “D” → HYDES – but ends in ES? No, HYDES ends in ES only if spelled HYDES, but that’s 6 letters. Wait, no 5-letter words ending in ES with H and Y in first two positions seem common.

Better candidate: “BUSED” already excluded U.

Next best: “TUSED” – T, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“PUSED” – P, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“CUSED” – C, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“DUSED” – D, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“HUSED” – H, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“WUSED” – W, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“BUSED” – same issue.

Let me step back: we need three letters from {B, C, D, G, H, K, P, T, W, Y} plus possibly a second E (but E is already fixed in position 4). Common combinations:

- B + E + D → BEDES (not a word)
- C + E + D → CEDES (valid word: C, E, D, E, S) – E in position 2 is allowed since we haven’t tested E elsewhere yet.
- C, E, D, E, S: none of these letters are in the excluded set.  
  “CEDES” is a valid 5-letter word meaning “I yield” or “I surrender”.

Therefore, CEDES is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear frequently in English words. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S and E in different positions than in AROSE (S was 4th, E was 5th).

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word that uses S and E plus common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""LINES"":
- L, I, N, E, S.
- S is now 5th (was 4th), E is now 4th (was 5th) – both moved.
- Uses L, I, N which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- No A, R, or O.

""LINES"" seems like a strong next guess.

From the new feedback on LINES:
- L, I, N are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – it is now the 4th letter.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – it is now the 5th letter.

So the secret word:
- Must be _ _ _ E S (positions 4 and 5 fixed as E and S).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, L, I, N.
- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

I need to fill the first three positions with letters that haven’t been ruled out and form a valid 5-letter word ending in “ES”.  
Possible candidates:  
- BUTES (but “BUTES” is not a common word)  
- CUPES (not valid)  
- DUNES (valid)  
- FUMES (valid)  
- GUMES (valid)  
- HUMES (valid)  
- TUNES (but N is already excluded)  
- WUMES (not valid)  

The best common word among these is “DUNES”.

Check: D, U, N, E, S – N was excluded in LINES, so “DUNES” is invalid.  
Next best: “FUMES” – F, U, M, E, S – none of these letters have been excluded yet.  
“FUMES” is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, I’ll guess FUMES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear frequently in English words. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S and E in different positions than in AROSE (S was 4th, E was 5th).

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word that uses S and E plus common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""LINES"":
- L, I, N, E, S.
- S is now 5th (was 4th), E is now 4th (was 5th) – both moved.
- Uses L, I, N which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- No A, R, or O.

""LINES"" seems like a strong next guess.

Guess 2: LINES -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(x) N(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on LINES:
- L, I, N are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – it is now the 4th letter.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – it is now the 5th letter.

So the secret word:
- Must be _ _ _ E S (positions 4 and 5 fixed as E and S).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, L, I, N.
- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

I need to fill the first three positions with letters that haven’t been ruled out and form a valid 5-letter word ending in “ES”.  
Possible candidates:  
- BUTES (but “BUTES” is not a common word)  
- CUPES (not valid)  
- DUNES (valid)  
- FUMES (valid)  
- GUMES (valid)  
- HUMES (valid)  
- TUNES (but N is already excluded)  
- WUMES (not valid)  

The best common word among these is “DUNES”.

Check: D, U, N, E, S – N was excluded in LINES, so “DUNES” is invalid.  
Next best: “FUMES” – F, U, M, E, S – none of these letters have been excluded yet.  
“FUMES” is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, I’ll guess FUMES.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: _ _ _ E S (positions 4 and 5 fixed).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, L, I, N, F, U, M.
3. Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, P, T, W, Y, plus any vowels not yet excluded (only E is confirmed in position 4; we still need to test other vowels in positions 1-3 if needed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ES” that uses only allowed letters in positions 1-3.  
Possible endings are already fixed as E S, so focus on the first three letters.

Quick scan of common words ending in “ES” that avoid all excluded letters:
- BUSED – B, U, S, E, D → U is excluded ❌
- CUBES – C, U, B, E, S → U is excluded ❌
- DUSED – D, U, S, E, D → U is excluded ❌
- HUSED – H, U, S, E, D → U is excluded ❌
- TUBES – T, U, B, E, S → U is excluded ❌
- WUSED – W, U, S, E, D → U is excluded ❌
- BLES – too short ❌
- CYMES – C, Y, M, E, S → M is excluded ❌
- BIKES – I is excluded ❌
- BUSES – U is excluded ❌
- DWEES – W, D, E, E, S – but double E is okay, and none of these letters are excluded.  
   Pattern: D W E E S – but position 3 would be E, which is already in position 4.  
   However, the word must have exactly 5 distinct positions, and E is allowed to appear twice as long as it’s in the correct final positions.  
   “DWEES” is a valid word (though rare), but let’s look for more common ones.

Another candidate: “H” + “Y” + “D” → HYDES – but ends in ES? No, HYDES ends in ES only if spelled HYDES, but that’s 6 letters. Wait, no 5-letter words ending in ES with H and Y in first two positions seem common.

Better candidate: “BUSED” already excluded U.

Next best: “TUSED” – T, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“PUSED” – P, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“CUSED” – C, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“DUSED” – D, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“HUSED” – H, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“WUSED” – W, U, S, E, D → U excluded ❌

“BUSED” – same issue.

Let me step back: we need three letters from {B, C, D, G, H, K, P, T, W, Y} plus possibly a second E (but E is already fixed in position 4). Common combinations:

- B + E + D → BEDES (not a word)
- C + E + D → CEDES (valid word: C, E, D, E, S) – E in position 2 is allowed since we haven’t tested E elsewhere yet.
- C, E, D, E, S: none of these letters are in the excluded set.  
  “CEDES” is a valid 5-letter word meaning “I yield” or “I surrender”.

Therefore, CEDES is a strong next guess.

None of the above combinations yield a valid 5-letter word using only the allowed letters. This suggests we need to consider a word that does not repeat E in positions 1-3. Let’s try:

- B + ? + ? → B _ _ E S (BUSED – U excluded, BIKES – I excluded, BAGES – A excluded, BRES – R excluded, etc.)

- W + ? + ? → W _ _ E S (WUSED – U excluded, WASES – A excluded, etc.)
- Y + ? + ? → Y _ _ E S (YUBES – U excluded, YASES – A excluded, etc.)

The only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is “BUSED,” but U is excluded. This indicates we must have missed a letter. Rechecking the allowed set: {B, G, H, K, P, T, W, Y}. 

A valid word using these letters is “WYSES” (a plural of “wys”), but it’s obscure. Another is “THYME” – but it doesn’t end in ES. 

Realizing we can use the letter “Y” as a vowel, let’s try:

- T + H + Y → THYES (valid word: T, H, Y, E, S) – none of these letters are excluded.

From the latest feedback on THYES:
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  → T must appear somewhere in positions 1-3 (since 4 and 5 are fixed as E and S).
- H is NOT in the word (x) → remove H from consideration.
- Y is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → Y must appear in positions 1-3 (since 4 and 5 are fixed).
- E and S are correctly placed in positions 4 and 5 (✓).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E S  
Letters to include: T and Y somewhere in the first three positions.  
Letters to exclude: A, R, O, L, I, N, F, U, M, C, D, H.

Remaining candidate letters for positions 1-3: B, G, K, P, T, Y, and possibly a second E (but E is already in position 4).

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ES” that:
- uses T and Y in positions 1-3,
- uses only allowed letters,
- is a valid English word.

Possible permutations of T and Y with two other allowed consonants:
- T Y _ E S → TY?ES (TYBES, TYGES, TYKES, TYLES, TYVES)
  - TYBES: valid (TYBES is plural of tybe, a dialectal term).
  - TYKES: valid (TYKES is plural of tyke, a colloquial term for child).
- _ T Y E S → ?TYES (BTYES – not a word, GTYES – not a word, etc.)
- _ Y T E S → ?YTE S (no common words).

The most common valid word among these is “TYKES”.

Check letters: T, Y, K, E, S – none are excluded except K was not explicitly excluded. All are allowed.

Therefore, TYKES is the correct next guess.
