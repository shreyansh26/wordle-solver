### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are present in the secret word.

1. Keeps S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, and O.

A good candidate is “STEIN”:

- I is common.
- N is common.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters confirmed to be in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓).

Letters confirmed to be in the word but with unknown positions:
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE). So E must be in position 2 or 4.

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
- A, R, O, T.

Letters confirmed to be in the word and their positions:
- I is in position 4 (✓).
- N is in position 5 (✓).

So the current partial word is:
S _ _ I N

The only remaining letter to determine is the second character.  
We know E must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for E are 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are taken by I and N, and 1 is S).  
But position 3 is still unknown, and position 2 is unknown.  
However, from STEIN we saw that E is not in position 3 (feedback E(-)), so E must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word must be: S E _ I N

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SEPIN"" (though not common), or ""SEMIN"" (which is a valid word meaning relating to a seminary).  
Given the constraints, ""SEMIN"" is the most plausible.

Let me verify:
- S(1) ✓
- E(2) must be here (only possible spot left for E)
- _ (3) needs to be a consonant not yet ruled out. Valid consonants left include L, D, G, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not A, R, or O.
- S cannot be in the 4th position (it must be in 1, 2, or 3).
- E cannot be in the 5th position (it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
1. Keeps S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, and O.

A good candidate is “STEIN”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- T is common.
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is common.
- N is common.

This tests new positions for S and E while adding high-frequency letters.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) I(✓) N(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters confirmed to be in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓).

Letters confirmed to be in the word but with unknown positions:
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE). So E must be in position 2 or 4.

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
- A, R, O, T.

Letters confirmed to be in the word and their positions:
- I is in position 4 (✓).
- N is in position 5 (✓).

So the current partial word is:
S _ _ I N

The only remaining letter to determine is the second character.  
We know E must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for E are 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are taken by I and N, and 1 is S).  
But position 3 is still unknown, and position 2 is unknown.  
However, from STEIN we saw that E is not in position 3 (feedback E(-)), so E must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word must be: S E _ I N

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SEPIN"" (though not common), or ""SEMIN"" (which is a valid word meaning relating to a seminary).  
Given the constraints, ""SEMIN"" is the most plausible.

Let me verify:
- S(1) ✓
- E(2) must be here (only possible spot left for E)
- _ (3) needs to be a consonant not yet ruled out. Valid consonants left include L, D, G, etc.
- I(4) ✓
- N(5) ✓

""SEMIN"" fits all constraints.
