### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, all of which are very common letters in English words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possible secret words based on the feedback we receive.

None of the five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller alphabet pool: the remaining high-frequency consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, and the remaining vowels are I and U.

I want a word that uses five of these unused letters and gives good coverage.  
A strong candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
- U and I are the only vowels left.  
- N, T, L are very common consonants.  
- No letter repeats, and none of them appeared in AROSE.  

So “UNTIL” should give us maximal new information.

2. Uses only letters from the allowed set (no A,R,O,S,E,N,T,I,L).
3. Uses distinct letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “DUCHY”:
- Letters: D, U, C, H, Y – all allowed.
- U is in position 2, satisfying the “-” feedback.
- All letters are unique.

This will test D, C, H, Y and confirm or eliminate U in a new position.

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):  
H (but not in position 4)

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains H somewhere other than position 4.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

A quick scan of the remaining letters suggests a word like “BUMPH” won’t work (P is allowed, but H can’t be in position 4).  
Instead, let’s try “JUMPY” – but J and M are allowed, and H isn’t used. We need H.

A valid word that fits the constraints: “HUMPH” – but P is allowed, and H is in positions 1 and 3.  
However, we can’t have H in position 4, and we need to test H elsewhere.

Another candidate: “GUMPY” – again misses H.

Let’s construct a word: positions 1,3,4 must be filled from B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H, with H not in 4.

One valid word: “BUMPY” – but again no H.

Wait, we need H somewhere. Let’s try:

Position 1: H  
Position 2: U (fixed)  
Position 3: M  
Position 4: must be H (but H can’t be in position 4) – so invalid.

Alternative:  
Position 1: M  
Position 2: U  
Position 3: H  
Position 4: B  
Position 5: Y  

Word: “M U H B Y” → “MUHBY” – not a valid English word.

Another attempt:  
Position 1: P  
Position 2: U  
Position 3: H  
Position 4: B  
Position 5: Y  

→ “PUHBY” – also invalid.

Let’s try “HUMPH” – H in positions 1 and 3, U in 2, Y not in 5. Doesn’t fit Y in 5.

We need a word with pattern: _ U _ _ Y, containing H not in position 4.

Valid English word: “JUMPY” – but no H.

Wait, let’s list valid English words matching _ U _ _ Y with allowed letters:

Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H must appear once (not in 4).

Possible words:
- BUMPY (no H)

- JUMPY (no H)
- KUMPY (no H)
- MUMPY (no H)
- PUMPY (no H)
- VUMPY (no H)

- HUMPY – H in position 1, U in 2, M in 3, P in 4, Y in 5.  
  Check constraints:  
  - H not in position 4 – satisfies (-) feedback.  
  - Uses only allowed letters.  
  - Valid English word.

Therefore, “HUMPY” is a strong next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, all of which are very common letters in English words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possible secret words based on the feedback we receive.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
None of the five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller alphabet pool: the remaining high-frequency consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, and the remaining vowels are I and U.

I want a word that uses five of these unused letters and gives good coverage.  
A strong candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
- U and I are the only vowels left.  
- N, T, L are very common consonants.  
- No letter repeats, and none of them appeared in AROSE.  

So “UNTIL” should give us maximal new information.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L  
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong position: U (from UNTIL)

So every remaining letter must be chosen from the unused alphabet:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letter U.

We know:
- U is in the word, but not in the 1st position (since it was marked “-” in position 1).
- No other letters are confirmed except U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U (not in position 1).
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set (no A,R,O,S,E,N,T,I,L).
3. Uses distinct letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “DUCHY”:
- Letters: D, U, C, H, Y – all allowed.
- U is in position 2, satisfying the “-” feedback.
- All letters are unique.

This will test D, C, H, Y and confirm or eliminate U in a new position.

Another attempt:

Position 3: H  
Position 4: B  
Position 5: Y  

→ “PUHBY” – also invalid.

Let’s try “HUMPH” – H in positions 1 and 3, U in 2, Y not in 5. Doesn’t fit Y in 5.

We need a word with pattern: _ U _ _ Y, containing H not in position 4.

Valid English word: “JUMPY” – but no H.

Wait, let’s list valid English words matching _ U _ _ Y with allowed letters:

Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H must appear once (not in 4).

Possible words:

- KUMPY (no H)
- MUMPY (no H)
- PUMPY (no H)
- VUMPY (no H)

- HUMPY – H in position 1, U in 2, M in 3, P in 4, Y in 5.  
  Check constraints:  
  - H not in position 4 – satisfies (-) feedback.  
  - Uses only allowed letters.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, all of which are very common letters in English words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possible secret words based on the feedback we receive.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
None of the five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That leaves us with a much smaller alphabet pool: the remaining high-frequency consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, and the remaining vowels are I and U.

I want a word that uses five of these unused letters and gives good coverage.  
A strong candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
- U and I are the only vowels left.  
- N, T, L are very common consonants.  
- No letter repeats, and none of them appeared in AROSE.  

So “UNTIL” should give us maximal new information.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L  
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong position: U (from UNTIL)

So every remaining letter must be chosen from the unused alphabet:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letter U.

We know:
- U is in the word, but not in the 1st position (since it was marked “-” in position 1).
- No other letters are confirmed except U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U (not in position 1).
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set (no A,R,O,S,E,N,T,I,L).
3. Uses distinct letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “DUCHY”:
- Letters: D, U, C, H, Y – all allowed.
- U is in position 2, satisfying the “-” feedback.
- All letters are unique.

This will test D, C, H, Y and confirm or eliminate U in a new position.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: DUCHY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) C(x) H(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback:

- D, C are not in the word (x).
- U is in the word and now known to be in position 2 (✓).
- H is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- Y is in the word and now known to be in position 5 (✓).

So far we have:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Known:    ?   U   ?   ?   Y  

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, C  

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):  
H (but not in position 4)

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains H somewhere other than position 4.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

A quick scan of the remaining letters suggests a word like “BUMPH” won’t work (P is allowed, but H can’t be in position 4).  
Instead, let’s try “JUMPY” – but J and M are allowed, and H isn’t used. We need H.

A valid word that fits the constraints: “HUMPH” – but P is allowed, and H is in positions 1 and 3.  
However, we can’t have H in position 4, and we need to test H elsewhere.

Another candidate: “GUMPY” – again misses H.

Let’s construct a word: positions 1,3,4 must be filled from B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H, with H not in 4.

One valid word: “BUMPY” – but again no H.

Wait, we need H somewhere. Let’s try:

Position 1: H  
Position 2: U (fixed)  
Position 3: M  
Position 4: must be H (but H can’t be in position 4) – so invalid.

Alternative:  
Position 1: M  
Position 2: U  
Position 3: H  
Position 4: B  
Position 5: Y  

Word: “M U H B Y” → “MUHBY” – not a valid English word.

Another attempt:  
Position 1: P  
Position 2: U  
Position 3: H  
Position 4: B  
Position 5: Y  

→ “PUHBY” – also invalid.

Let’s try “HUMPH” – H in positions 1 and 3, U in 2, Y not in 5. Doesn’t fit Y in 5.

We need a word with pattern: _ U _ _ Y, containing H not in position 4.

Valid English word: “JUMPY” – but no H.

Wait, let’s list valid English words matching _ U _ _ Y with allowed letters:

Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and H must appear once (not in 4).

Possible words:
- BUMPY (no H)
- GUMPY (no H)
- JUMPY (no H)
- KUMPY (no H)
- MUMPY (no H)
- PUMPY (no H)
- VUMPY (no H)
- WUMPY (no H)
- HUMPY – H in position 1, U in 2, M in 3, P in 4, Y in 5.  
  Check constraints:  
  - H not in position 4 – satisfies (-) feedback.  
  - Uses only allowed letters.  
  - Valid English word.

Therefore, “HUMPY” is a strong next guess.

From the latest feedback:

- Position 1: H (✓) — H is correct and in the right spot.
- Position 2: U (✓) — U is correct and in the right spot.
- Position 3: M (x) — M is not in the word at all.
- Position 4: P (x) — P is not in the word at all.
- Position 5: Y (✓) — Y is correct and in the right spot.

So the pattern is now:
H U _ _ Y

Letters already eliminated (from all guesses):
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, C, M, P

Remaining candidate letters (unused and not eliminated):
B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with HU and ends with Y, with the 3rd and 4th letters chosen from the remaining set, and with no repeats.

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common English word that fits is:

H U B B Y — but B is repeated, and we don’t know if B can be used twice.
H U G G Y — same issue with G.
H U F F Y — same.
H U J J Y — not a word.
H U K K Y — not a word.
H U V V Y — not a word.
H U W W Y — not a word.
H U B B Y — again, not valid.

Wait — let’s check H U B B Y again. It is actually a valid English word (a nickname for Hubert or a diminutive form). But since we have no information about B yet, and it hasn’t been eliminated, this is the only remaining possibility.

Therefore, the next guess must be HUBBY.
