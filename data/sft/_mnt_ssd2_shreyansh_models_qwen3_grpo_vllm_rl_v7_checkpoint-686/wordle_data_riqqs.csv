### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 common consonants.
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants.
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - similar to above.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and common consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   - Additional letters not in the word: P, G
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S (not in 1), R (not in 3), I (not in 4)

So far we know the word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, P, G
- R is not in positions 2 or 3
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 4

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

We need to place R, S, I plus two more consonants (avoiding P, G) and check positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5 (since 2,3 are excluded)
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ _
  - S can be 2,3,5
  - I can be 2,3,5
  - Need two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)

Example: R I S T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Try R I S T N → ""RISTN"" – not a valid word.

Try R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.

Alternative: R _ I S _ → ""R"" + consonant + ""I S"" + consonant  
""R"" + ""T"" + ""I S"" + ""N"" → ""RTISN"" – invalid.

Try S in 2: _ S _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,3,5

Example: S R I T _ → ""SRI T_"" – invalid.

Try S in 3: _ _ S _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,2,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try S in 5: _ _ _ _ S
- R can be 1,4
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: R I T S _ → ""RITS_"" – invalid.

Try I in 1: I _ _ _ _
- R can be 4,5
- S can be 2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 2: _ I _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 3,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 3: _ _ I _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 2,5

Example: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 5: _ _ _ _ I
- R can be 1,4
- S can be 2,3

Example: R S T _ I → ""RST_I"" – invalid.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that contain R,S,I and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""TRISK"" – contains T,R,I,S,K – valid word? ""TRISK"" is not common.
- ""CRISP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""DRISK"" – not a word
- ""FIRST"" – has F and T, but S is in 4 (forbidden)
- ""SHIFT"" – has F,T, but no I
- ""TRIMS"" – has M, but S is in 5 (allowed), but I is in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden)
- ""TRIPS"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""TRIPE"" – has P,E (forbidden)
- ""TRISK"" – as above
- ""STRIP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRL"" – has L, but I is in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (forbidden), T in 2, I in 3, R in 4 (allowed), L in 5 – but S is in 1 (forbidden)

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:

Letters to place: R,S,I plus two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

Constraints:
- R not in 2,3
- S not in 1,4
- I not in 4

Let’s try R in 4: _ _ _ R _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 1,2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.
Try: S I T R _ → ""SITR_"" – invalid.
Try: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.
Try: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

R in 5: _ _ _ _ R
- S can be 2,3
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: S T I _ R → ""STI_R"" – invalid.
Try: I S T _ R → ""IST_R"" – invalid.
Try: T I S _ R → ""TIS_R"" – invalid.

R in 1: R _ _ _ _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 2,3,5

Example: R I S T _ → ""RIST_"" – invalid.
Try: R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.
Try: R T I S _ → ""RTIS_"" – invalid.

This suggests we need to use remaining common letters like T,N,L,D,U,Y.

Let’s try ""DRYSI"" – invalid.
""URINS"" – invalid.
""URIST"" – not common.
""TRIUN"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s try ""TRI"" + consonants:
""TRI"" + ""T"" + ""Y"" → ""TRITY"" – invalid.

""TRI"" + ""L"" + ""D"" → ""TRI LD"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""S"" + ""T"" + ""R"" + ""I"" + ""N"" → ""STRIN"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R is not forbidden in 3? Wait, feedback says R is in word but wrong position, and in AROSE R was in 2, in SPRIG R was in 3. So R is not in 2 or 3 – thus R must be in 1,4,5.
""STRIN"" has R in 3 – invalid.

Next valid word: ""STIRN"" – not common.
""STIRL"" – has L, but S is in 1 (forbidden)
""STIRR"" – invalid (double R)
""TRIST"" – has T,R,I,S,T – valid word? ""TRIST"" is archaic but valid.

Check:
- R in 2 – forbidden (from AROSE)
Invalid.

""RUSTI"" – has U,T,I,S,R – valid word? ""RUSTI"" is plural of rust, but has U,S,T,I,R – let’s check positions:
R in 1 (allowed), U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), T in 4, I in 5 (allowed)
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R not in 2,3 – yes (R in 1)
- S not in 1,4 – yes (S in 3)
- I not in 4 – yes (I in 5)

This seems valid! ""RUSTI"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of rust in some contexts).

Let’s go with ""RUSTI"".

  - I can be 2,3,5
  - Need two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)

Example: R I S T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Try R I S T N → ""RISTN"" – not a valid word.

Try R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.

Alternative: R _ I S _ → ""R"" + consonant + ""I S"" + consonant  
""R"" + ""T"" + ""I S"" + ""N"" → ""RTISN"" – invalid.

Try S in 2: _ S _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,3,5

Example: S R I T _ → ""SRI T_"" – invalid.

Try S in 3: _ _ S _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,2,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try S in 5: _ _ _ _ S
- R can be 1,4

Example: R I T S _ → ""RITS_"" – invalid.

Try I in 1: I _ _ _ _
- R can be 4,5

Example: R S T _ I → ""RST_I"" – invalid.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that contain R,S,I and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""TRISK"" – contains T,R,I,S,K – valid word? ""TRISK"" is not common.
- ""CRISP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""DRISK"" – not a word
- ""FIRST"" – has F and T, but S is in 4 (forbidden)
- ""SHIFT"" – has F,T, but no I
- ""TRIMS"" – has M, but S is in 5 (allowed), but I is in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden)
- ""TRIPS"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""TRIPE"" – has P,E (forbidden)
- ""TRISK"" – as above
- ""STRIP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRL"" – has L, but I is in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (forbidden), T in 2, I in 3, R in 4 (allowed), L in 5 – but S is in 1 (forbidden)

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:

Letters to place: R,S,I plus two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

Constraints:
- R not in 2,3
- S not in 1,4
- I not in 4

Let’s try R in 4: _ _ _ R _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 1,2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.
Try: S I T R _ → ""SITR_"" – invalid.
Try: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.
Try: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

R in 5: _ _ _ _ R
- S can be 2,3
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: S T I _ R → ""STI_R"" – invalid.
Try: I S T _ R → ""IST_R"" – invalid.
Try: T I S _ R → ""TIS_R"" – invalid.

R in 1: R _ _ _ _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 2,3,5

Example: R I S T _ → ""RIST_"" – invalid.
Try: R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.
Try: R T I S _ → ""RTIS_"" – invalid.

This suggests we need to use remaining common letters like T,N,L,D,U,Y.

Let’s try ""DRYSI"" – invalid.
""URINS"" – invalid.
""URIST"" – not common.
""TRIUN"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s try ""TRI"" + consonants:
""TRI"" + ""T"" + ""Y"" → ""TRITY"" – invalid.

""TRI"" + ""L"" + ""D"" → ""TRI LD"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""S"" + ""T"" + ""R"" + ""I"" + ""N"" → ""STRIN"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R is not forbidden in 3? Wait, feedback says R is in word but wrong position, and in AROSE R was in 2, in SPRIG R was in 3. So R is not in 2 or 3 – thus R must be in 1,4,5.
""STRIN"" has R in 3 – invalid.

Next valid word: ""STIRN"" – not common.
""STIRL"" – has L, but S is in 1 (forbidden)
""STIRR"" – invalid (double R)
""TRIST"" – has T,R,I,S,T – valid word? ""TRIST"" is archaic but valid.

Check:
- R in 2 – forbidden (from AROSE)
Invalid.

""RUSTI"" – has U,T,I,S,R – valid word? ""RUSTI"" is plural of rust, but has U,S,T,I,R – let’s check positions:
R in 1 (allowed), U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), T in 4, I in 5 (allowed)
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R not in 2,3 – yes (R in 1)
- S not in 1,4 – yes (S in 3)
- I not in 4 – yes (I in 5)

This seems valid! ""RUSTI"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of rust in some contexts).

Let’s go with ""RUSTI"".",Guess 3: RUSTI -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) S(-) T(x) I(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 common consonants.
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants.
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - similar to above.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and common consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Does contain R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Uses R and S in different positions.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Possible vowels left: I, U
Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""FIRST"":
- F, I, R, S, T
- R is in position 3 (was in 2)
- S is in position 4 (was in 4 - same position, but feedback says S is in word but wrong position, so position 4 is wrong for S, so FIRST would have S in 4 again - bad)
Wait, that's no good.

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in 2 (was in 2 - no, same position)
No good.

Try ""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S
- R in 2 (was in 2)
No good.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in 2 (was in 2)
No good.

Try ""SPRIG"":
- S, P, R, I, G
- S in 1 (was in 4)
- R in 3 (was in 2)
This looks good - uses S in 1, R in 3, introduces P, I, G.

<guess>SPRIG</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: R (not in 2), S (not in 4)

2. SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: P, G
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S (not in 1), R (not in 3), I (not in 4)

So far we know the word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, P, G
- R is not in positions 2 or 3
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 4

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

We need to place R, S, I plus two more consonants (avoiding P, G) and check positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5 (since 2,3 are excluded)
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ _
  - S can be 2,3,5
  - I can be 2,3,5
  - Need two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)

Example: R I S T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Try R I S T N → ""RISTN"" – not a valid word.

Try R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.

Alternative: R _ I S _ → ""R"" + consonant + ""I S"" + consonant  
""R"" + ""T"" + ""I S"" + ""N"" → ""RTISN"" – invalid.

Try S in 2: _ S _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,3,5

Example: S R I T _ → ""SRI T_"" – invalid.

Try S in 3: _ _ S _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,2,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try S in 5: _ _ _ _ S
- R can be 1,4
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: R I T S _ → ""RITS_"" – invalid.

Try I in 1: I _ _ _ _
- R can be 4,5
- S can be 2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 2: _ I _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 3,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 3: _ _ I _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 2,5

Example: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 5: _ _ _ _ I
- R can be 1,4
- S can be 2,3

Example: R S T _ I → ""RST_I"" – invalid.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that contain R,S,I and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""TRISK"" – contains T,R,I,S,K – valid word? ""TRISK"" is not common.
- ""CRISP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""DRISK"" – not a word
- ""FIRST"" – has F and T, but S is in 4 (forbidden)
- ""SHIFT"" – has F,T, but no I
- ""TRIMS"" – has M, but S is in 5 (allowed), but I is in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden)
- ""TRIPS"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""TRIPE"" – has P,E (forbidden)
- ""TRISK"" – as above
- ""STRIP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRL"" – has L, but I is in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (forbidden), T in 2, I in 3, R in 4 (allowed), L in 5 – but S is in 1 (forbidden)

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:

Letters to place: R,S,I plus two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

Constraints:
- R not in 2,3
- S not in 1,4
- I not in 4

Let’s try R in 4: _ _ _ R _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 1,2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.
Try: S I T R _ → ""SITR_"" – invalid.
Try: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.
Try: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

R in 5: _ _ _ _ R
- S can be 2,3
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: S T I _ R → ""STI_R"" – invalid.
Try: I S T _ R → ""IST_R"" – invalid.
Try: T I S _ R → ""TIS_R"" – invalid.

R in 1: R _ _ _ _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 2,3,5

Example: R I S T _ → ""RIST_"" – invalid.
Try: R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.
Try: R T I S _ → ""RTIS_"" – invalid.

This suggests we need to use remaining common letters like T,N,L,D,U,Y.

Let’s try ""DRYSI"" – invalid.
""URINS"" – invalid.
""URIST"" – not common.
""TRIUN"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s try ""TRI"" + consonants:
""TRI"" + ""T"" + ""Y"" → ""TRITY"" – invalid.

""TRI"" + ""L"" + ""D"" → ""TRI LD"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""S"" + ""T"" + ""R"" + ""I"" + ""N"" → ""STRIN"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R is not forbidden in 3? Wait, feedback says R is in word but wrong position, and in AROSE R was in 2, in SPRIG R was in 3. So R is not in 2 or 3 – thus R must be in 1,4,5.
""STRIN"" has R in 3 – invalid.

Next valid word: ""STIRN"" – not common.
""STIRL"" – has L, but S is in 1 (forbidden)
""STIRR"" – invalid (double R)
""TRIST"" – has T,R,I,S,T – valid word? ""TRIST"" is archaic but valid.

Check:
- R in 2 – forbidden (from AROSE)
Invalid.

""RUSTI"" – has U,T,I,S,R – valid word? ""RUSTI"" is plural of rust, but has U,S,T,I,R – let’s check positions:
R in 1 (allowed), U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), T in 4, I in 5 (allowed)
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R not in 2,3 – yes (R in 1)
- S not in 1,4 – yes (S in 3)
- I not in 4 – yes (I in 5)

This seems valid! ""RUSTI"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of rust in some contexts).

Let’s go with ""RUSTI"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 common consonants.
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants.
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - similar to above.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and common consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Does contain R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Uses R and S in different positions.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Possible vowels left: I, U
Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""FIRST"":
- F, I, R, S, T
- R is in position 3 (was in 2)
- S is in position 4 (was in 4 - same position, but feedback says S is in word but wrong position, so position 4 is wrong for S, so FIRST would have S in 4 again - bad)
Wait, that's no good.

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in 2 (was in 2 - no, same position)
No good.

Try ""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S
- R in 2 (was in 2)
No good.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in 2 (was in 2)
No good.

Try ""SPRIG"":
- S, P, R, I, G
- S in 1 (was in 4)
- R in 3 (was in 2)
This looks good - uses S in 1, R in 3, introduces P, I, G.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: R (not in 2), S (not in 4)

2. SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: P, G
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S (not in 1), R (not in 3), I (not in 4)

So far we know the word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, P, G
- R is not in positions 2 or 3
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 4

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

We need to place R, S, I plus two more consonants (avoiding P, G) and check positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5 (since 2,3 are excluded)
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ _
  - S can be 2,3,5
  - I can be 2,3,5
  - Need two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)

Example: R I S T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Try R I S T N → ""RISTN"" – not a valid word.

Try R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.

Alternative: R _ I S _ → ""R"" + consonant + ""I S"" + consonant  
""R"" + ""T"" + ""I S"" + ""N"" → ""RTISN"" – invalid.

Try S in 2: _ S _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,3,5

Example: S R I T _ → ""SRI T_"" – invalid.

Try S in 3: _ _ S _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,2,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try S in 5: _ _ _ _ S
- R can be 1,4
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: R I T S _ → ""RITS_"" – invalid.

Try I in 1: I _ _ _ _
- R can be 4,5
- S can be 2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 2: _ I _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 3,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 3: _ _ I _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 2,5

Example: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 5: _ _ _ _ I
- R can be 1,4
- S can be 2,3

Example: R S T _ I → ""RST_I"" – invalid.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that contain R,S,I and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""TRISK"" – contains T,R,I,S,K – valid word? ""TRISK"" is not common.
- ""CRISP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""DRISK"" – not a word
- ""FIRST"" – has F and T, but S is in 4 (forbidden)
- ""SHIFT"" – has F,T, but no I
- ""TRIMS"" – has M, but S is in 5 (allowed), but I is in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden)
- ""TRIPS"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""TRIPE"" – has P,E (forbidden)
- ""TRISK"" – as above
- ""STRIP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRL"" – has L, but I is in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (forbidden), T in 2, I in 3, R in 4 (allowed), L in 5 – but S is in 1 (forbidden)

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:

Letters to place: R,S,I plus two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

Constraints:
- R not in 2,3
- S not in 1,4
- I not in 4

Let’s try R in 4: _ _ _ R _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 1,2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.
Try: S I T R _ → ""SITR_"" – invalid.
Try: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.
Try: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

R in 5: _ _ _ _ R
- S can be 2,3
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: S T I _ R → ""STI_R"" – invalid.
Try: I S T _ R → ""IST_R"" – invalid.
Try: T I S _ R → ""TIS_R"" – invalid.

R in 1: R _ _ _ _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 2,3,5

Example: R I S T _ → ""RIST_"" – invalid.
Try: R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.
Try: R T I S _ → ""RTIS_"" – invalid.

This suggests we need to use remaining common letters like T,N,L,D,U,Y.

Let’s try ""DRYSI"" – invalid.
""URINS"" – invalid.
""URIST"" – not common.
""TRIUN"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s try ""TRI"" + consonants:
""TRI"" + ""T"" + ""Y"" → ""TRITY"" – invalid.

""TRI"" + ""L"" + ""D"" → ""TRI LD"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""S"" + ""T"" + ""R"" + ""I"" + ""N"" → ""STRIN"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R is not forbidden in 3? Wait, feedback says R is in word but wrong position, and in AROSE R was in 2, in SPRIG R was in 3. So R is not in 2 or 3 – thus R must be in 1,4,5.
""STRIN"" has R in 3 – invalid.

Next valid word: ""STIRN"" – not common.
""STIRL"" – has L, but S is in 1 (forbidden)
""STIRR"" – invalid (double R)
""TRIST"" – has T,R,I,S,T – valid word? ""TRIST"" is archaic but valid.

Check:
- R in 2 – forbidden (from AROSE)
Invalid.

""RUSTI"" – has U,T,I,S,R – valid word? ""RUSTI"" is plural of rust, but has U,S,T,I,R – let’s check positions:
R in 1 (allowed), U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), T in 4, I in 5 (allowed)
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R not in 2,3 – yes (R in 1)
- S not in 1,4 – yes (S in 3)
- I not in 4 – yes (I in 5)

This seems valid! ""RUSTI"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of rust in some contexts).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 common consonants.
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants.
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - similar to above.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and common consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Does contain R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Uses R and S in different positions.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Possible vowels left: I, U
Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""FIRST"":
- F, I, R, S, T
- R is in position 3 (was in 2)
- S is in position 4 (was in 4 - same position, but feedback says S is in word but wrong position, so position 4 is wrong for S, so FIRST would have S in 4 again - bad)
Wait, that's no good.

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in 2 (was in 2 - no, same position)
No good.

Try ""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S
- R in 2 (was in 2)
No good.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in 2 (was in 2)
No good.

Try ""SPRIG"":
- S, P, R, I, G
- S in 1 (was in 4)
- R in 3 (was in 2)
This looks good - uses S in 1, R in 3, introduces P, I, G.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: R (not in 2), S (not in 4)

2. SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: P, G
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S (not in 1), R (not in 3), I (not in 4)

So far we know the word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, P, G
- R is not in positions 2 or 3
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 4

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

We need to place R, S, I plus two more consonants (avoiding P, G) and check positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5 (since 2,3 are excluded)
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ _
  - S can be 2,3,5
  - I can be 2,3,5
  - Need two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)

Example: R I S T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Try R I S T N → ""RISTN"" – not a valid word.

Try R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.

Alternative: R _ I S _ → ""R"" + consonant + ""I S"" + consonant  
""R"" + ""T"" + ""I S"" + ""N"" → ""RTISN"" – invalid.

Try S in 2: _ S _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,3,5

Example: S R I T _ → ""SRI T_"" – invalid.

Try S in 3: _ _ S _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- I can be 1,2,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try S in 5: _ _ _ _ S
- R can be 1,4
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: R I T S _ → ""RITS_"" – invalid.

Try I in 1: I _ _ _ _
- R can be 4,5
- S can be 2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 2: _ I _ _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 3,5

Example: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 3: _ _ I _ _
- R can be 1,4,5
- S can be 2,5

Example: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

Try I in 5: _ _ _ _ I
- R can be 1,4
- S can be 2,3

Example: R S T _ I → ""RST_I"" – invalid.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that contain R,S,I and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""TRISK"" – contains T,R,I,S,K – valid word? ""TRISK"" is not common.
- ""CRISP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""DRISK"" – not a word
- ""FIRST"" – has F and T, but S is in 4 (forbidden)
- ""SHIFT"" – has F,T, but no I
- ""TRIMS"" – has M, but S is in 5 (allowed), but I is in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden)
- ""TRIPS"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""TRIPE"" – has P,E (forbidden)
- ""TRISK"" – as above
- ""STRIP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRP"" – has P (forbidden)
- ""STIRL"" – has L, but I is in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (forbidden), T in 2, I in 3, R in 4 (allowed), L in 5 – but S is in 1 (forbidden)

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:

Letters to place: R,S,I plus two more consonants (avoiding P,G,A,O,E)
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

Constraints:
- R not in 2,3
- S not in 1,4
- I not in 4

Let’s try R in 4: _ _ _ R _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 1,2,3,5

Example: I S T R _ → ""ISTR_"" – invalid.
Try: S I T R _ → ""SITR_"" – invalid.
Try: T I S R _ → ""TISR_"" – invalid.
Try: S T I R _ → ""STIR_"" – invalid.

R in 5: _ _ _ _ R
- S can be 2,3
- I can be 1,2,3

Example: S T I _ R → ""STI_R"" – invalid.
Try: I S T _ R → ""IST_R"" – invalid.
Try: T I S _ R → ""TIS_R"" – invalid.

R in 1: R _ _ _ _
- S can be 2,3,5
- I can be 2,3,5

Example: R I S T _ → ""RIST_"" – invalid.
Try: R S I T _ → ""RSIT_"" – invalid.
Try: R T I S _ → ""RTIS_"" – invalid.

This suggests we need to use remaining common letters like T,N,L,D,U,Y.

Let’s try ""DRYSI"" – invalid.
""URINS"" – invalid.
""URIST"" – not common.
""TRIUN"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s try ""TRI"" + consonants:
""TRI"" + ""T"" + ""Y"" → ""TRITY"" – invalid.

""TRI"" + ""L"" + ""D"" → ""TRI LD"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""S"" + ""T"" + ""R"" + ""I"" + ""N"" → ""STRIN"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R is not forbidden in 3? Wait, feedback says R is in word but wrong position, and in AROSE R was in 2, in SPRIG R was in 3. So R is not in 2 or 3 – thus R must be in 1,4,5.
""STRIN"" has R in 3 – invalid.

Next valid word: ""STIRN"" – not common.
""STIRL"" – has L, but S is in 1 (forbidden)
""STIRR"" – invalid (double R)
""TRIST"" – has T,R,I,S,T – valid word? ""TRIST"" is archaic but valid.

Check:
- R in 2 – forbidden (from AROSE)
Invalid.

""RUSTI"" – has U,T,I,S,R – valid word? ""RUSTI"" is plural of rust, but has U,S,T,I,R – let’s check positions:
R in 1 (allowed), U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), T in 4, I in 5 (allowed)
- Contains R,S,I – yes
- No A,O,E,P,G – yes
- R not in 2,3 – yes (R in 1)
- S not in 1,4 – yes (S in 3)
- I not in 4 – yes (I in 5)

This seems valid! ""RUSTI"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of rust in some contexts).

Let’s go with ""RUSTI"".

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in word: A, O, E
   - Letters in word but wrong place: R (not 2), S (not 4)

2. SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
   - Additional letters not in word: P, G
   - Letters in word but wrong place: S (not 1), R (not 3), I (not 4)

3. RUSTI → R(✓) U(x) S(-) T(x) I(-)
   - Additional letters not in word: U, T
   - R is now confirmed in position 1 (✓)
   - S is in word but not in position 3 (-)
   - I is in word but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
- Word starts with R
- Must contain S and I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, P, G, U, T
- S is not in positions 1, 3, 4
- I is not in positions 4, 5

Possible positions:
- R is fixed at 1: R _ _ _ _
- S can be 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are excluded)
- I can be 2 or 3 (since 4,5 are excluded)

We need two more consonants from remaining letters: common ones left are D, L, N, C, Y, etc.

Let’s try:
- If S is in 2: R S _ _ _
  - I must be 3: R S I _ _
  - Need two more consonants for positions 4 and 5, avoiding forbidden letters.
  - Possible: R S I D Y → ""RSIDY"" – invalid
  - R S I N D → ""RSIND"" – invalid
  - R S I L D → ""RSILD"" – invalid

- If S is in 5: R _ _ _ S
  - I must be 2 or 3
  - If I is 2: R I _ _ S
    - Need consonants for 3 and 4: R I D L S → ""RIDLS"" – invalid
    - R I N D S → ""RINDS"" – valid word!
  - If I is 3: R _ I _ S
    - Need consonants for 2 and 4: R D I N S → ""R DINS"" – invalid
    - R N I D S → ""RNIDS"" – invalid

""RINDS"" seems valid and fits all constraints:
- R in 1 (✓)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N and D are allowed letters
- S in 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

From Guess 4 (RINDS) we now have:
- R(✓)  → position 1 is R
- I(✓)  → position 2 is I
- N(x)  → N is not in the word
- D(x)  → D is not in the word
- S(✓)  → position 5 is S

So the word pattern is now:
R I _ _ S

Letters already confirmed:
- R at 1
- I at 2
- S at 5

Letters still needed: two consonants for positions 3 and 4, chosen from letters not yet ruled out.
Forbidden letters so far: A, O, E, P, G, U, T, N, D.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, Y, M, B, F, H, K, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form R I _ _ S.
Possible candidates:
- R I V E S → contains E (forbidden)
- R I V A S → contains A (forbidden)
- R I C H S → ""RICH S"" is not a word
- R I L L S → ""RILLS"" – valid word
- R I V E S – invalid (E)
- R I V A S – invalid (A)
- R I M E S – invalid (E)
- R I V E S – invalid (E)
- R I C K S – ""RICKS"" – valid word
- R I V E S – invalid (E)

Between ""RILLS"" and ""RICKS"":
- ""RILLS"" uses L and L – valid
- ""RICKS"" uses C and K – valid

Both fit the pattern and constraints. ""RILLS"" is more straightforward with common letters.
