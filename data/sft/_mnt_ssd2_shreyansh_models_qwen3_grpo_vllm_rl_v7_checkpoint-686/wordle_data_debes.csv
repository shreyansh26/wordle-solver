For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids A, R, I (since they are confirmed absent).
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Common letters left to try: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that places S and E in new positions and uses other common consonants. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4).
- E moves to position 5 (was position 5, but since E is in the word but wrong position originally, position 5 is now allowed again? Wait, original feedback said E was in position 5 with (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E must be in positions 1-4. So STOLE has E in position 5, which is invalid.

Next candidate: “SLOPE”
- S in position 1 (was 4, now new position).
- E in position 4 (was 5, now new position).
- Uses L, O, P which are common and haven't been tested.

This seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, I, L, O, P  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): S, E  

So far:
- S has appeared in positions 4 (ARISE) and 1 (SLOPE), both marked “-” → S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
- E has appeared in positions 5 (ARISE) and 4 (SLOPE), both marked “-” → E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

Therefore:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

We still need three more distinct consonants (cannot use A, R, I, L, O, P).  
Good remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, G, B, M, H, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places S in position 2 (middle slot).  
- Places E in position 1 (beginning).  
- Fills positions 3 and 4 with two unused common consonants.  
- Places the final letter in position 5 (must be unused).

Candidate: E S T N Y → “ESTNY” is not a valid English word.  
Try “ESTER” – but R is excluded.  
Try “ESTOP” – P is excluded.  
Try “ESSEN” – double S and N, but S already handled.  
Try “ETHOS” – O and H are okay? O is excluded.  
Try “ESCHT” – not valid.  
Try “ESSEX” – X is allowed, but double S.  

A valid English word that satisfies the constraints:
E in position 1, S in position 2, and three unused consonants:  
“ESSEX” – but X is allowed and not yet excluded, and it’s a valid word. However, it has double S, and we only know one S exists. Let’s avoid double letters.

Another valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESCHE” – not common.  
“ESUNT” – not a word.  
“ESBIR” – not a word.  

Let’s pick “ESTER” is invalid.  
“ESSEX” is acceptable despite double S because we don’t know S count.  
But to be safe, let’s try a word with unique letters:  
E S _ _ _ with two new consonants.  
“ESBOW” – O excluded.  
“ESBUN” – not a word.

“ESSEN” – N twice.  

Let’s use “ESSEX” as it’s a valid word and fits constraints.  
But to avoid double letters, let’s try “ESBIR” – not valid.  

Wait, let’s list valid English words with E and S, no A,R,I,L,O,P:

E _ S _ _ or E _ _ S _ or _ E S _ _ etc.

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  
“DENSE” – N and D are allowed, but S and E positions?  
“DENSE” has E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4).  

“MENSE” – same issue.  

“TENSE” – E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).  

“HASTE” – A excluded.  

“BESOT” – O excluded.  

“CENSE” – C and N allowed, E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).

“FENSE” – not a word.  

“GENSE” – not a word.  

“LENSE” – L excluded.  

“TENSE” – S in 4 invalid.  

“UNSET” – U, N allowed, E in 3 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).  

“BUSED” – B, U, D allowed, E in 3, S in 2 (allowed).  
“BUSED” is a valid word: past tense of bus, or plural of bus.  
Letters: B, U, S, E, D – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  
S in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4).  

Oops, E cannot be in 4.  

Try “BUSED” – E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESIX” – X allowed, E in 2, S in 3.  
“BESIX” is valid (British slang for six).  
Letters: B, E, S, I, X – but I is excluded.  

Try “BESOT” – O excluded.  

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  

Try “BESSE” – double S, E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESNY” – not a word.  

Let’s try S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and fill 1,3,4 with unused consonants.  
Word pattern: _ E _ _ S  
Valid word: “HEXES” – H, X allowed, E in 2, S in 5.  
“HEXES” is valid.  

Check letters: H, E, X, E, S – double E is okay since we don’t know E count, but we only know at least one E.  
It uses H, E, X, S – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids A, R, I (since they are confirmed absent).
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Common letters left to try: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that places S and E in new positions and uses other common consonants. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4).
- E moves to position 5 (was position 5, but since E is in the word but wrong position originally, position 5 is now allowed again? Wait, original feedback said E was in position 5 with (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E must be in positions 1-4. So STOLE has E in position 5, which is invalid.

Next candidate: “SLOPE”
- S in position 1 (was 4, now new position).
- E in position 4 (was 5, now new position).
- Uses L, O, P which are common and haven't been tested.

This seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, I, L, O, P  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): S, E  

So far:
- S has appeared in positions 4 (ARISE) and 1 (SLOPE), both marked “-” → S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
- E has appeared in positions 5 (ARISE) and 4 (SLOPE), both marked “-” → E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

Therefore:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

We still need three more distinct consonants (cannot use A, R, I, L, O, P).  
Good remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, G, B, M, H, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places S in position 2 (middle slot).  
- Places E in position 1 (beginning).  
- Fills positions 3 and 4 with two unused common consonants.  
- Places the final letter in position 5 (must be unused).

Candidate: E S T N Y → “ESTNY” is not a valid English word.  
Try “ESTER” – but R is excluded.  
Try “ESTOP” – P is excluded.  
Try “ESSEN” – double S and N, but S already handled.  
Try “ETHOS” – O and H are okay? O is excluded.  
Try “ESCHT” – not valid.  
Try “ESSEX” – X is allowed, but double S.  

A valid English word that satisfies the constraints:
E in position 1, S in position 2, and three unused consonants:  
“ESSEX” – but X is allowed and not yet excluded, and it’s a valid word. However, it has double S, and we only know one S exists. Let’s avoid double letters.

Another valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESCHE” – not common.  
“ESUNT” – not a word.  
“ESBIR” – not a word.  

Let’s pick “ESTER” is invalid.  
“ESSEX” is acceptable despite double S because we don’t know S count.  
But to be safe, let’s try a word with unique letters:  
E S _ _ _ with two new consonants.  
“ESBOW” – O excluded.  
“ESBUN” – not a word.  

A valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESSEN” – N twice.  

Let’s use “ESSEX” as it’s a valid word and fits constraints.  
But to avoid double letters, let’s try “ESBIR” – not valid.  

Wait, let’s list valid English words with E and S, no A,R,I,L,O,P:

E _ S _ _ or E _ _ S _ or _ E S _ _ etc.

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  
“DENSE” – N and D are allowed, but S and E positions?  
“DENSE” has E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4).  

“MENSE” – same issue.  

“TENSE” – E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).  

“HASTE” – A excluded.  

“BESOT” – O excluded.  

“CENSE” – C and N allowed, E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).  

“DENSE” already seen.  

“FENSE” – not a word.  

“GENSE” – not a word.  

“LENSE” – L excluded.  

“TENSE” – S in 4 invalid.  

“UNSET” – U, N allowed, E in 3 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).  

“BUSED” – B, U, D allowed, E in 3, S in 2 (allowed).  
“BUSED” is a valid word: past tense of bus, or plural of bus.  
Letters: B, U, S, E, D – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  
S in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4).  

Oops, E cannot be in 4.  

Try “BUSED” – E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESIX” – X allowed, E in 2, S in 3.  
“BESIX” is valid (British slang for six).  
Letters: B, E, S, I, X – but I is excluded.  

Try “BESOT” – O excluded.  

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  

Try “BESSE” – double S, E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESNY” – not a word.  

Let’s try S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and fill 1,3,4 with unused consonants.  
Word pattern: _ E _ _ S  
Valid word: “HEXES” – H, X allowed, E in 2, S in 5.  
“HEXES” is valid.  

Check letters: H, E, X, E, S – double E is okay since we don’t know E count, but we only know at least one E.  
It uses H, E, X, S – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  

So “HEXES” is a valid guess.

“ESSEX” – but X is allowed and not yet excluded, and it’s a valid word. However, it has double S, and we only know one S exists. Let’s avoid double letters.

Another valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESCHE” – not common.  
“ESUNT” – not a word.  
“ESBIR” – not a word.  

Let’s pick “ESTER” is invalid.  
“ESSEX” is acceptable despite double S because we don’t know S count.  
But to be safe, let’s try a word with unique letters:  
E S _ _ _ with two new consonants.  
“ESBOW” – O excluded.  
“ESBUN” – not a word.  

A valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESSEN” – N twice.  

Let’s use “ESSEX” as it’s a valid word and fits constraints.  
But to avoid double letters, let’s try “ESBIR” – not valid.  

Wait, let’s list valid English words with E and S, no A,R,I,L,O,P:

E _ S _ _ or E _ _ S _ or _ E S _ _ etc.

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  
“DENSE” – N and D are allowed, but S and E positions?  
“DENSE” has E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4).  

“MENSE” – same issue.  

“TENSE” – E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).  

“HASTE” – A excluded.  

“BESOT” – O excluded.  

“CENSE” – C and N allowed, E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).  

“DENSE” already seen.  

“FENSE” – not a word.  

“GENSE” – not a word.  

“LENSE” – L excluded.  

“TENSE” – S in 4 invalid.  

“UNSET” – U, N allowed, E in 3 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).  

“BUSED” – B, U, D allowed, E in 3, S in 2 (allowed).  
“BUSED” is a valid word: past tense of bus, or plural of bus.  
Letters: B, U, S, E, D – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  
S in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4).  

Oops, E cannot be in 4.  

Try “BUSED” – E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESIX” – X allowed, E in 2, S in 3.  
“BESIX” is valid (British slang for six).  
Letters: B, E, S, I, X – but I is excluded.  

Try “BESOT” – O excluded.  

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  

Try “BESSE” – double S, E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESNY” – not a word.  

Let’s try S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and fill 1,3,4 with unused consonants.  
Word pattern: _ E _ _ S  
Valid word: “HEXES” – H, X allowed, E in 2, S in 5.  
“HEXES” is valid.  

Check letters: H, E, X, E, S – double E is okay since we don’t know E count, but we only know at least one E.  
It uses H, E, X, S – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  

So “HEXES” is a valid guess.

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word looks like: _ E _ E S

We need three distinct letters for positions 1 and 3 (position 2,4,5 already fixed).  
Available letters (not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

We want common consonants. Let’s pick two from: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, T, U, Y.

Valid 5-letter English words fitting _ E _ E S:
- BEDES – not common
- CEDES – valid
- DEFES – not a word
- FEMES – not common
- JONES – valid
- KEDES – not a word
- MELES – not a word
- MUSES – valid
- NEMES – not a word
- TEGES – not a word
- TUBES – valid
- VENES – not a word
- WEDES – not common
- YODES – not a word

Best candidates: CEDES, JONES, MUSES, TUBES.

Among these, let’s pick one that uses fresh, common consonants.  
CEDES uses C and D (both unused).  
JONES uses J and N.  
MUSES uses M and U.  
TUBES uses T and B.

All are valid, but let’s choose CEDES first because C and D are very common and not yet tried.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids A, R, I (since they are confirmed absent).
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Common letters left to try: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that places S and E in new positions and uses other common consonants. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4).
- E moves to position 5 (was position 5, but since E is in the word but wrong position originally, position 5 is now allowed again? Wait, original feedback said E was in position 5 with (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E must be in positions 1-4. So STOLE has E in position 5, which is invalid.

Next candidate: “SLOPE”
- S in position 1 (was 4, now new position).
- E in position 4 (was 5, now new position).
- Uses L, O, P which are common and haven't been tested.

This seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, I, L, O, P  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): S, E  

So far:
- S has appeared in positions 4 (ARISE) and 1 (SLOPE), both marked “-” → S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
- E has appeared in positions 5 (ARISE) and 4 (SLOPE), both marked “-” → E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

Therefore:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

We still need three more distinct consonants (cannot use A, R, I, L, O, P).  
Good remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, G, B, M, H, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places S in position 2 (middle slot).  
- Places E in position 1 (beginning).  
- Fills positions 3 and 4 with two unused common consonants.  
- Places the final letter in position 5 (must be unused).

Candidate: E S T N Y → “ESTNY” is not a valid English word.  
Try “ESTER” – but R is excluded.  
Try “ESTOP” – P is excluded.  
Try “ESSEN” – double S and N, but S already handled.  
Try “ETHOS” – O and H are okay? O is excluded.  
Try “ESCHT” – not valid.  
Try “ESSEX” – X is allowed, but double S.  

A valid English word that satisfies the constraints:
E in position 1, S in position 2, and three unused consonants:  
“ESSEX” – but X is allowed and not yet excluded, and it’s a valid word. However, it has double S, and we only know one S exists. Let’s avoid double letters.

Another valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESCHE” – not common.  
“ESUNT” – not a word.  
“ESBIR” – not a word.  

Let’s pick “ESTER” is invalid.  
“ESSEX” is acceptable despite double S because we don’t know S count.  
But to be safe, let’s try a word with unique letters:  
E S _ _ _ with two new consonants.  
“ESBOW” – O excluded.  
“ESBUN” – not a word.  

A valid word: “ESTER” – R excluded.  
“ESSEN” – N twice.  

Let’s use “ESSEX” as it’s a valid word and fits constraints.  
But to avoid double letters, let’s try “ESBIR” – not valid.  

Wait, let’s list valid English words with E and S, no A,R,I,L,O,P:

E _ S _ _ or E _ _ S _ or _ E S _ _ etc.

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  
“DENSE” – N and D are allowed, but S and E positions?  
“DENSE” has E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4).  

“MENSE” – same issue.  

“TENSE” – E in 2, S in 4 (invalid).  

“HASTE” – A excluded.

“TENSE” – S in 4 invalid.  

“UNSET” – U, N allowed, E in 3 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).  

“BUSED” – B, U, D allowed, E in 3, S in 2 (allowed).  
“BUSED” is a valid word: past tense of bus, or plural of bus.  
Letters: B, U, S, E, D – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  
S in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4).  

Oops, E cannot be in 4.  

Try “BUSED” – E in 4 invalid.  

Try “BESIX” – X allowed, E in 2, S in 3.  
“BESIX” is valid (British slang for six).  
Letters: B, E, S, I, X – but I is excluded.  

Try “BESOT” – O excluded.  

Try “BESOM” – O excluded.  

Try “BESSE” – double S, E in 4 invalid.

Let’s try S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and fill 1,3,4 with unused consonants.  
Word pattern: _ E _ _ S  
Valid word: “HEXES” – H, X allowed, E in 2, S in 5.  
“HEXES” is valid.  

Check letters: H, E, X, E, S – double E is okay since we don’t know E count, but we only know at least one E.  
It uses H, E, X, S – none of A,R,I,L,O,P.  

So “HEXES” is a valid guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, R, I, L, O, P, H, X

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word looks like: _ E _ E S

We need three distinct letters for positions 1 and 3 (position 2,4,5 already fixed).  
Available letters (not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

We want common consonants. Let’s pick two from: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, T, U, Y.

Valid 5-letter English words fitting _ E _ E S:
- BEDES – not common
- CEDES – valid
- DEFES – not a word
- FEMES – not common
- JONES – valid
- KEDES – not a word
- MELES – not a word
- MUSES – valid
- NEMES – not a word
- TEGES – not a word
- TUBES – valid
- VENES – not a word
- WEDES – not common
- YODES – not a word

Best candidates: CEDES, JONES, MUSES, TUBES.

Among these, let’s pick one that uses fresh, common consonants.  
CEDES uses C and D (both unused).  
JONES uses J and N.  
MUSES uses M and U.  
TUBES uses T and B.

All are valid, but let’s choose CEDES first because C and D are very common and not yet tried.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ E _ E S (positions 2, 4, 5 fixed as E, E, S)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, L, O, P, H, X, C
- Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z
- From CEDES: D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so D must be in position 1)

Therefore the word must be: D E _ E S

We need one more letter for position 3, chosen from the allowed list excluding already used letters.
Valid 5-letter English words fitting D E _ E S:
- DEBES – not common
- DEFES – not a word
- DEMES – not a word
- DENES – not a word
- DEGES – not a word
- DEKES – valid (plural of ""dike"" in Scots)
- DEVES – not a word
- DEWES – valid (plural of ""wye"" in Welsh, or old spelling of ""wies"")

Between DEKES and DEWES, both are valid, but DEWES is more commonly recognized as a word (though rare). DEKES is also valid but less common.

Let’s choose DEWES as it’s more likely to be accepted.
