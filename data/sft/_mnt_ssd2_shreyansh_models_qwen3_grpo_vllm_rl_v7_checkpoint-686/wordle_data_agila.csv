For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- T: x → not in the word at all
- E: x → not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Contains L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses L and A
2. Does NOT use S, T, or E
3. Places L somewhere other than position 2
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed, we might need others)

Possible structure: since A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words:
- CLAMP: uses C, L, A, M, P → but L is in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- CLADI: C, L, A, D, I → L is in position 2 (invalid)

Try shifting positions:
- ALARM: A in position 1, L in position 2 (invalid for L)
- CRANK: doesn't use A
- PLANK: L in position 2 (invalid)
- GLAND: G, L, A, N, D → L in position 2 (invalid)

Let me try words where L is not in position 2:
- CLAVI: C, L, A, V, I → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAZA: P, L, A, Z, A → L in position 2 (invalid)

Hmm, many common words put L in position 2 with A. Let me try:
- LARVA: L in position 1, A in position 2 → both placements are allowed
- LAGOO: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed
- LANKY: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

Round 2 (LARVA):
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R and V are NOT in the word (x).
- The final A in position 5 is CORRECT (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, R, V.
- Letters that are IN:
  – A must be in position 5 (✓).
  – L must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from rounds 1 and 2). Therefore L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already A, so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the eliminated ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 5.
2. Has L in position 3 or 4.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, T, E, R, V).

Possible structures:
- _ _ L _ A  (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L A  (L in position 4)

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns:

For _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid (N is okay, but A repeats in position 4 which we know is wrong)
- C L A M A → M is okay, but A repeats
- P L A N A → same issue
- F L A N A → same
- B L A C A → C is okay, but A repeats

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid (A repeats)
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → already considered
- C L O L A → invalid
- P L O L A → invalid

Wait, let’s list valid words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4, using allowed letters.

Valid candidates:
- C L A N A → invalid (A repeats)
- P L A N A → invalid
- B L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- C L A M A → invalid
- P L A M A → invalid
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- C L O C A → invalid
- P L O C A → invalid

Hmm, many words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4 end up repeating A or using eliminated letters. Let me think differently: the word must have exactly one A (in position 5), and L must be in position 3 or 4.

Looking at _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid
- C L A N A → invalid
- D L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- G L A N A → invalid
- H L A N A → invalid
- K L A N A → invalid
- M L A N A → invalid
- N L A N A → invalid
- P L A N A → invalid
- Q L A N A → invalid
- U L A N A → invalid
- W L A N A → invalid
- Y L A N A → invalid

None of these seem valid. Let me try _ _ _ L A instead.

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → invalid
- C L A C A → invalid
- P L A C A → invalid
- C H O L A → valid! (C, H, O, L, A) – uses allowed letters and fits the constraints: A in 5, L in 4, no repeats, no eliminated letters.
- P H O L A → invalid (P, H, O, L, A) – but P is allowed, H is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed. This seems valid too.
- B H O L A → invalid (B is allowed, but H, O, L, A are allowed)
- C H O L A seems the most straightforward valid word.

Let me verify:
- C, H, O, L, A – none are eliminated.
- A is in position 5 (✓).
- L is in position 4 (which is allowed since it can't be 1 or 2).
- No repeats of letters.
- No eliminated letters (S, T, E, R, V are absent).

Therefore, ""CHOLA"" is a valid next guess.

Hmm, many words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4 end up repeating A or using eliminated letters. Let me think differently: the word must have exactly one A (in position 5), and L must be in position 3 or 4.

Looking at _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid
- C L A N A → invalid
- D L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- G L A N A → invalid
- H L A N A → invalid
- K L A N A → invalid
- M L A N A → invalid
- N L A N A → invalid
- P L A N A → invalid
- Q L A N A → invalid
- U L A N A → invalid
- W L A N A → invalid
- Y L A N A → invalid

None of these seem valid. Let me try _ _ _ L A instead.

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → invalid
- C L A C A → invalid
- P L A C A → invalid
- C H O L A → valid! (C, H, O, L, A) – uses allowed letters and fits the constraints: A in 5, L in 4, no repeats, no eliminated letters.
- P H O L A → invalid (P, H, O, L, A) – but P is allowed, H is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed. This seems valid too.
- B H O L A → invalid (B is allowed, but H, O, L, A are allowed)
- C H O L A seems the most straightforward valid word.

Let me verify:
- C, H, O, L, A – none are eliminated.
- A is in position 5 (✓).
- L is in position 4 (which is allowed since it can't be 1 or 2).
- No repeats of letters.
- No eliminated letters (S, T, E, R, V are absent).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- T: x → not in the word at all
- E: x → not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Contains L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses L and A
2. Does NOT use S, T, or E
3. Places L somewhere other than position 2
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed, we might need others)

Possible structure: since A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words:
- CLAMP: uses C, L, A, M, P → but L is in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- CLADI: C, L, A, D, I → L is in position 2 (invalid)

Try shifting positions:
- ALARM: A in position 1, L in position 2 (invalid for L)
- CRANK: doesn't use A
- PLANK: L in position 2 (invalid)
- GLAND: G, L, A, N, D → L in position 2 (invalid)

Let me try words where L is not in position 2:
- CLAVI: C, L, A, V, I → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAZA: P, L, A, Z, A → L in position 2 (invalid)

Hmm, many common words put L in position 2 with A. Let me try:
- LARVA: L in position 1, A in position 2 → both placements are allowed
- LAGOO: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed
- LANKY: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed

""LARVA"" seems good - it uses L and A in new positions and introduces new letters (R, V).

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

Round 2 (LARVA):
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R and V are NOT in the word (x).
- The final A in position 5 is CORRECT (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, R, V.
- Letters that are IN:
  – A must be in position 5 (✓).
  – L must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from rounds 1 and 2). Therefore L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already A, so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the eliminated ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 5.
2. Has L in position 3 or 4.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, T, E, R, V).

Possible structures:
- _ _ L _ A  (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L A  (L in position 4)

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns:

For _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid (N is okay, but A repeats in position 4 which we know is wrong)
- C L A M A → M is okay, but A repeats
- P L A N A → same issue
- F L A N A → same
- B L A C A → C is okay, but A repeats

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid (A repeats)
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → already considered
- C L O L A → invalid
- P L O L A → invalid

Wait, let’s list valid words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4, using allowed letters.

Valid candidates:
- C L A N A → invalid (A repeats)
- P L A N A → invalid
- B L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- C L A M A → invalid
- P L A M A → invalid
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- C L O C A → invalid
- P L O C A → invalid

Hmm, many words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4 end up repeating A or using eliminated letters. Let me think differently: the word must have exactly one A (in position 5), and L must be in position 3 or 4.

Looking at _ _ L _ A:

- F L A N A → invalid
- G L A N A → invalid
- H L A N A → invalid
- K L A N A → invalid

- N L A N A → invalid
- P L A N A → invalid
- Q L A N A → invalid
- U L A N A → invalid
- W L A N A → invalid
- Y L A N A → invalid

None of these seem valid. Let me try _ _ _ L A instead.

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → invalid
- C L A C A → invalid
- P L A C A → invalid
- C H O L A → valid! (C, H, O, L, A) – uses allowed letters and fits the constraints: A in 5, L in 4, no repeats, no eliminated letters.
- P H O L A → invalid (P, H, O, L, A) – but P is allowed, H is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed. This seems valid too.
- B H O L A → invalid (B is allowed, but H, O, L, A are allowed)

- A is in position 5 (✓).
- L is in position 4 (which is allowed since it can't be 1 or 2).

This is tricky. Let me try with F, I, N, L, A but L is already in position 4.

I think I need to consider less common words or check if any valid words fit. After reconsidering, the only valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ _ L A with no repeats and no eliminated letters is:

- P I N L A → not a word
- F I N L A → not a word
- M I N L A → not a word
- B I N L A → not a word

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""FINAL"".

Check ""FINAL"":

  – A is in position 5 (✓)
  – L is in position 4 (✓)
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 3
- Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ _ L A
using only the allowed letters for positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible candidates:
- B I L L A → invalid (L repeats)
- D I L L A → invalid
- F I L L A → invalid
- G I L L A → invalid
- M I L L A → invalid
- N I L L A → invalid

- M O L L A → invalid
- N O L L A → invalid
- P O L L A → invalid

None of these work because they repeat L. We need words with L only in position 4.

Let me think of common 5-letter words ending in ""LA"" with no repeats and no eliminated letters.

- B I N L A → not a word
- D I N L A → not a word

- M U N L A → not a word
- N U N L A → not a word
- P U N L A → not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me try different combinations.

- B I M L A → not a word

- F U M L A → not a word
- G U M L A → not a word
- M U M L A → not a word
- N U M L A → not a word

Still nothing. Let me try with K:

- B I K L A → not a word
- D I K L A → not a word
- F I K L A → not a word
- G I K L A → not a word
- M I K L A → not a word

- F U K L A → not a word
- G U K L A → not a word
- M U K L A → not a word
- N U K L A → not a word
- P U K L A → not a word

This is tricky. Let me try with F, I, N, L, A but L is already in position 4.

Wait, the word must be _ _ _ L A with no repeats and no eliminated letters.

Looking at valid English words:
- B I L L A → invalid (L repeats)
- D I L L A → invalid

Still nothing. Let me try with K and I:

- M U K L A → not a word

This is proving difficult. Let me try with N, I, K:

- B I N K L A → too long
- B I N L A → not a word
- D I N L A → not a word
- F I N L A → not a word

- F U N L A → not a word
- G U N L A → not a word
- M U N L A → not a word
- N U N L A → not a word
- P U N L A → not a word

I think I need to consider less common words or check if any valid words fit. After reconsidering, the only valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ _ L A with no repeats and no eliminated letters is:

- P I N L A → not a word
- F I N L A → not a word
- M I N L A → not a word
- B I N L A → not a word

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""FINAL"".

Check ""FINAL"":
- F, I, N, A, L
- A is in position 5 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters used: F, I, N, L, A
- None are eliminated (F, I, N are allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- T: x → not in the word at all
- E: x → not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Contains L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses L and A
2. Does NOT use S, T, or E
3. Places L somewhere other than position 2
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed, we might need others)

Possible structure: since A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words:
- CLAMP: uses C, L, A, M, P → but L is in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- CLADI: C, L, A, D, I → L is in position 2 (invalid)

Try shifting positions:
- ALARM: A in position 1, L in position 2 (invalid for L)
- CRANK: doesn't use A
- PLANK: L in position 2 (invalid)
- GLAND: G, L, A, N, D → L in position 2 (invalid)

Let me try words where L is not in position 2:
- CLAVI: C, L, A, V, I → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAZA: P, L, A, Z, A → L in position 2 (invalid)

Hmm, many common words put L in position 2 with A. Let me try:
- LARVA: L in position 1, A in position 2 → both placements are allowed
- LAGOO: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed
- LANKY: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed

""LARVA"" seems good - it uses L and A in new positions and introduces new letters (R, V).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LARVA -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) R(x) V(x) A(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

Round 2 (LARVA):
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R and V are NOT in the word (x).
- The final A in position 5 is CORRECT (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, R, V.
- Letters that are IN:
  – A must be in position 5 (✓).
  – L must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from rounds 1 and 2). Therefore L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already A, so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the eliminated ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 5.
2. Has L in position 3 or 4.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, T, E, R, V).

Possible structures:
- _ _ L _ A  (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L A  (L in position 4)

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns:

For _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid (N is okay, but A repeats in position 4 which we know is wrong)
- C L A M A → M is okay, but A repeats
- P L A N A → same issue
- F L A N A → same
- B L A C A → C is okay, but A repeats

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid (A repeats)
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → already considered
- C L O L A → invalid
- P L O L A → invalid

Wait, let’s list valid words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4, using allowed letters.

Valid candidates:
- C L A N A → invalid (A repeats)
- P L A N A → invalid
- B L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- C L A M A → invalid
- P L A M A → invalid
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- C L O C A → invalid
- P L O C A → invalid

Hmm, many words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4 end up repeating A or using eliminated letters. Let me think differently: the word must have exactly one A (in position 5), and L must be in position 3 or 4.

Looking at _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid
- C L A N A → invalid
- D L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- G L A N A → invalid
- H L A N A → invalid
- K L A N A → invalid
- M L A N A → invalid
- N L A N A → invalid
- P L A N A → invalid
- Q L A N A → invalid
- U L A N A → invalid
- W L A N A → invalid
- Y L A N A → invalid

None of these seem valid. Let me try _ _ _ L A instead.

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → invalid
- C L A C A → invalid
- P L A C A → invalid
- C H O L A → valid! (C, H, O, L, A) – uses allowed letters and fits the constraints: A in 5, L in 4, no repeats, no eliminated letters.
- P H O L A → invalid (P, H, O, L, A) – but P is allowed, H is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed. This seems valid too.
- B H O L A → invalid (B is allowed, but H, O, L, A are allowed)
- C H O L A seems the most straightforward valid word.

Let me verify:
- C, H, O, L, A – none are eliminated.
- A is in position 5 (✓).
- L is in position 4 (which is allowed since it can't be 1 or 2).
- No repeats of letters.
- No eliminated letters (S, T, E, R, V are absent).

Therefore, ""CHOLA"" is a valid next guess.

- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 3
- Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ _ L A
using only the allowed letters for positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible candidates:
- B I L L A → invalid (L repeats)

None of these work because they repeat L. We need words with L only in position 4.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters OUT (never appear):  
S, T, E, R, V, C, H, O, F, N

Letters that ARE in the word (from feedback):  
- A – must appear (we saw it in positions 3 and 5 in earlier guesses, but only position 5 is confirmed ✓ in CHOLA and FINAL shows A(-) in position 4, so A is definitely present; however, FINAL’s A(-) in position 4 means A is NOT in position 4, and we already had A(✓) in position 5, so A is fixed in position 5).  
- L – must appear (L(✓) in position 4 from CHOLA).  
- I – appears somewhere (I(-) in FINAL means I is in the word but not in position 2).

So the word has:  
_ _ _ L A  
with I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and no repeats of letters already ruled out.

Allowed letters left:  
B, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus I, which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
[1 or 2 or 3 = I] _ _ L A  
using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:  
I _ _ L A, _ I _ L A, _ _ I L A  

Looking for common words:  
- D I M L A – not a word  
- B I G L A – not a word  
- G I M L A – not a word  
- P I K L A – not a word  
- M I K L A – not a word  
- B U I L A – not a word  
- D U I L A – not a word  
- P U I L A – not a word  

After checking, the only valid English word that fits _ _ I L A with the remaining letters is “MILIA” (though it repeats I, which is allowed since we only know one I must be present and repeats aren’t ruled out). However, MILIA has two I’s, and we don’t know if the word has only one I.

But looking again, the pattern _ I _ L A gives us “PIGLA” – not a word.  
The pattern I _ _ L A gives us “DIGLA” – not a word.

Rechecking the allowed letters and valid words, the only valid word that fits is:

- B I L L A – invalid (double L)  
- D I L L A – invalid  
- G I L L A – invalid  
- M I L L A – invalid  
- P I L L A – invalid  

None of these are valid. Let me try with K:

- B I K L A – not a word  
- D I K L A – not a word  
- G I K L A – not a word  
- M I K L A – not a word  
- P I K L A – not a word  

After careful reconsideration, the only valid English word that fits the constraints is “MILIA,” even though it has two I’s. This is acceptable because we only know one I must be present; the second I could be a repeat.

However, let me double-check for other possibilities. The pattern _ _ I L A with remaining letters gives:

- P I L A – too short  
- B U I L A – not a word  
- D U I L A – not a word  

Another valid word is “WILIA” – but W is allowed, I is allowed, L and A are fixed. However, “WILIA” is a proper noun (name) and may not be acceptable in Wordle-like games.

The most likely valid word is “MILIA.”

But wait – let me try “GILIA.”  
G, I, L, I, A – fits the pattern _ _ I L A, uses allowed letters (G, I, L, A), and has no eliminated letters. It is also a valid English word (a plant genus).  

Therefore, “GILIA” is the best next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- T: x → not in the word at all
- E: x → not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Contains L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses L and A
2. Does NOT use S, T, or E
3. Places L somewhere other than position 2
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed, we might need others)

Possible structure: since A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words:
- CLAMP: uses C, L, A, M, P → but L is in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N → L is in position 2 (invalid)
- CLADI: C, L, A, D, I → L is in position 2 (invalid)

Try shifting positions:
- ALARM: A in position 1, L in position 2 (invalid for L)
- CRANK: doesn't use A
- PLANK: L in position 2 (invalid)
- GLAND: G, L, A, N, D → L in position 2 (invalid)

Let me try words where L is not in position 2:
- CLAVI: C, L, A, V, I → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLAZA: P, L, A, Z, A → L in position 2 (invalid)

Hmm, many common words put L in position 2 with A. Let me try:
- LARVA: L in position 1, A in position 2 → both placements are allowed
- LAGOO: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed
- LANKY: L in position 1, A in position 2 → allowed

""LARVA"" seems good - it uses L and A in new positions and introduces new letters (R, V).

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

Round 2 (LARVA):
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R and V are NOT in the word (x).
- The final A in position 5 is CORRECT (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, R, V.
- Letters that are IN:
  – A must be in position 5 (✓).
  – L must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from rounds 1 and 2). Therefore L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already A, so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the eliminated ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 5.
2. Has L in position 3 or 4.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, T, E, R, V).

Possible structures:
- _ _ L _ A  (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L A  (L in position 4)

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns:

For _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid (N is okay, but A repeats in position 4 which we know is wrong)
- C L A M A → M is okay, but A repeats
- P L A N A → same issue
- F L A N A → same
- B L A C A → C is okay, but A repeats

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid (A repeats)
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → already considered
- C L O L A → invalid
- P L O L A → invalid

Wait, let’s list valid words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4, using allowed letters.

Valid candidates:
- C L A N A → invalid (A repeats)
- P L A N A → invalid
- B L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- C L A M A → invalid
- P L A M A → invalid
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- C L O C A → invalid
- P L O C A → invalid

Hmm, many words with A in position 5 and L in position 3 or 4 end up repeating A or using eliminated letters. Let me think differently: the word must have exactly one A (in position 5), and L must be in position 3 or 4.

Looking at _ _ L _ A:
- B L A N A → invalid
- C L A N A → invalid
- D L A N A → invalid
- F L A N A → invalid
- G L A N A → invalid
- H L A N A → invalid
- K L A N A → invalid
- M L A N A → invalid
- N L A N A → invalid
- P L A N A → invalid
- Q L A N A → invalid
- U L A N A → invalid
- W L A N A → invalid
- Y L A N A → invalid

None of these seem valid. Let me try _ _ _ L A instead.

For _ _ _ L A:
- C H A L A → invalid
- P H A L A → invalid
- B L A C A → invalid
- C L A C A → invalid
- P L A C A → invalid
- C H O L A → valid! (C, H, O, L, A) – uses allowed letters and fits the constraints: A in 5, L in 4, no repeats, no eliminated letters.
- P H O L A → invalid (P, H, O, L, A) – but P is allowed, H is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed. This seems valid too.
- B H O L A → invalid (B is allowed, but H, O, L, A are allowed)
- C H O L A seems the most straightforward valid word.

Let me verify:
- C, H, O, L, A – none are eliminated.
- A is in position 5 (✓).
- L is in position 4 (which is allowed since it can't be 1 or 2).
- No repeats of letters.
- No eliminated letters (S, T, E, R, V are absent).

Therefore, ""CHOLA"" is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the three rounds:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
2. LARVA → L(-) A(-) R(x) V(x) A(✓)
3. CHOLA → C(x) H(x) O(x) L(✓) A(✓)

What we now know:

- Letters OUT: S, T, E, R, V, C, H, O
- Letters IN and fixed:
  – A is in position 5 (✓)
  – L is in position 4 (✓)
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 3
- Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ _ L A
using only the allowed letters for positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible candidates:
- B I L L A → invalid (L repeats)
- D I L L A → invalid
- F I L L A → invalid
- G I L L A → invalid
- M I L L A → invalid
- N I L L A → invalid

- D O L L A → invalid
- F O L L A → invalid
- G O L L A → invalid
- M O L L A → invalid
- N O L L A → invalid
- P O L L A → invalid

None of these work because they repeat L. We need words with L only in position 4.

Let me think of common 5-letter words ending in ""LA"" with no repeats and no eliminated letters.

- B I N L A → not a word
- D I N L A → not a word
- F I N L A → not a word

- G U N L A → not a word
- M U N L A → not a word
- N U N L A → not a word
- P U N L A → not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Let me try different combinations.

- B I M L A → not a word
- D I M L A → not a word
- F I M L A → not a word
- G I M L A → not a word
- M I M L A → not a word
- N I M L A → not a word

- F U M L A → not a word
- G U M L A → not a word
- M U M L A → not a word
- N U M L A → not a word
- P U M L A → not a word

Still nothing. Let me try with K:

- B I K L A → not a word
- D I K L A → not a word
- F I K L A → not a word
- G I K L A → not a word
- M I K L A → not a word
- N I K L A → not a word
- P I K L A → not a word
- B U K L A → not a word
- D U K L A → not a word
- F U K L A → not a word
- G U K L A → not a word
- M U K L A → not a word
- N U K L A → not a word
- P U K L A → not a word

This is tricky. Let me try with F, I, N, L, A but L is already in position 4.

Wait, the word must be _ _ _ L A with no repeats and no eliminated letters.

Looking at valid English words:
- B I L L A → invalid (L repeats)
- D I L L A → invalid
- F I L L A → invalid
- G I L L A → invalid
- M I L L A → invalid
- N I L L A → invalid

- D O L L A → invalid
- F O L L A → invalid
- G O L L A → invalid
- M O L L A → invalid
- N O L L A → invalid
- P O L L A → invalid

None of these are valid. Let me try with J:

- B I J L A → not a word
- D I J L A → not a word
- F I J L A → not a word
- G I J L A → not a word
- M I J L A → not a word

- F U J L A → not a word
- G U J L A → not a word
- M U J L A → not a word
- N U J L A → not a word
- P U J L A → not a word

Still nothing. Let me try with K and I:

- B I K L A → not a word
- D I K L A → not a word
- F I K L A → not a word
- G I K L A → not a word
- M I K L A → not a word
- N I K L A → not a word
- P I K L A → not a word
- B U K L A → not a word

- F U K L A → not a word
- G U K L A → not a word
- M U K L A → not a word
- N U K L A → not a word
- P U K L A → not a word

This is proving difficult. Let me try with N, I, K:

- B I N K L A → too long
- B I N L A → not a word
- D I N L A → not a word
- F I N L A → not a word
- G I N L A → not a word
- M I N L A → not a word
- N I N L A → not a word
- P I N L A → not a word
- B U N L A → not a word
- D U N L A → not a word
- F U N L A → not a word
- G U N L A → not a word
- M U N L A → not a word
- N U N L A → not a word
- P U N L A → not a word

I think I need to consider less common words or check if any valid words fit. After reconsidering, the only valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ _ L A with no repeats and no eliminated letters is:

- P I N L A → not a word
- F I N L A → not a word
- M I N L A → not a word
- B I N L A → not a word

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""FINAL"".

Check ""FINAL"":
- F, I, N, A, L
- A is in position 5 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters used: F, I, N, L, A
- None are eliminated (F, I, N are allowed)
- No repeats

""FINAL"" fits perfectly.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters OUT (never appear):  
S, T, E, R, V, C, H, O, F, N

Letters that ARE in the word (from feedback):  
- A – must appear (we saw it in positions 3 and 5 in earlier guesses, but only position 5 is confirmed ✓ in CHOLA and FINAL shows A(-) in position 4, so A is definitely present; however, FINAL’s A(-) in position 4 means A is NOT in position 4, and we already had A(✓) in position 5, so A is fixed in position 5).  
- L – must appear (L(✓) in position 4 from CHOLA).  
- I – appears somewhere (I(-) in FINAL means I is in the word but not in position 2).

So the word has:  
_ _ _ L A  
with I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and no repeats of letters already ruled out.

Allowed letters left:  
B, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus I, which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
[1 or 2 or 3 = I] _ _ L A  
using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:  
I _ _ L A, _ I _ L A, _ _ I L A  

Looking for common words:  
- D I M L A – not a word  
- B I G L A – not a word  
- G I M L A – not a word  
- P I K L A – not a word  
- M I K L A – not a word  
- B U I L A – not a word  
- D U I L A – not a word  
- P U I L A – not a word  

After checking, the only valid English word that fits _ _ I L A with the remaining letters is “MILIA” (though it repeats I, which is allowed since we only know one I must be present and repeats aren’t ruled out). However, MILIA has two I’s, and we don’t know if the word has only one I.

But looking again, the pattern _ I _ L A gives us “PIGLA” – not a word.  
The pattern I _ _ L A gives us “DIGLA” – not a word.

Rechecking the allowed letters and valid words, the only valid word that fits is:

- B I L L A – invalid (double L)  
- D I L L A – invalid  
- G I L L A – invalid  
- M I L L A – invalid  
- P I L L A – invalid  

None of these are valid. Let me try with K:

- B I K L A – not a word  
- D I K L A – not a word  
- G I K L A – not a word  
- M I K L A – not a word  
- P I K L A – not a word  

After careful reconsideration, the only valid English word that fits the constraints is “MILIA,” even though it has two I’s. This is acceptable because we only know one I must be present; the second I could be a repeat.

However, let me double-check for other possibilities. The pattern _ _ I L A with remaining letters gives:

- P I L A – too short  
- B U I L A – not a word  
- D U I L A – not a word  

Another valid word is “WILIA” – but W is allowed, I is allowed, L and A are fixed. However, “WILIA” is a proper noun (name) and may not be acceptable in Wordle-like games.

The most likely valid word is “MILIA.”

But wait – let me try “GILIA.”  
G, I, L, I, A – fits the pattern _ _ I L A, uses allowed letters (G, I, L, A), and has no eliminated letters. It is also a valid English word (a plant genus).  

Therefore, “GILIA” is the best next guess.

However, MILIA has two I’s, and we don’t know if the word has only one I.\n\nBut looking again, the pattern _ I _ L A gives us “PIGLA” – not a word.  \nThe pattern I _ _ L A gives us “DIGLA” – not a word.\n\nRechecking the allowed letters and valid words, the only valid word that fits is:\n\n- B I L L A – invalid (double L)  \n- D I L L A – invalid  \n- G I L L A – invalid  \n- M I L L A – invalid  \n- P I L L A – invalid  \n\nNone of these are valid.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know:

Letters OUT (never appear):  
S, T, E, R, V, C, H, O, F, N, G

Letters that ARE in the word (from feedback):  
- A – fixed in position 5 (✓)  
- L – fixed in position 4 (✓)  
- I – must appear somewhere (each “-” so far indicates it is in the word but not in the tested spot)

So the word has the skeleton:  
_ _ _ L A  

and must contain at least one I in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Allowed letters left:  
B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, I

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
[1 or 2 or 3 = I] _ _ L A  
using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:  
I _ _ L A, _ I _ L A, _ _ I L A  

Let’s list valid English words that fit:

- I _ _ L A:  “IBILA” – invalid, not a word  
- _ I _ L A:  “PIGLA” – invalid, G is out  
- _ _ I L A:  “MILIA” – valid word (but has double I)  
  “DILIA” – invalid (D is allowed, but not a word)  
  “BILIA” – valid (anatomy plural of bila, a rare word)  
  “KILIA” – invalid  
  “PILIA” – valid (Latin-derived plural)  

Among these, “MILIA” is the most common and acceptable.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:
