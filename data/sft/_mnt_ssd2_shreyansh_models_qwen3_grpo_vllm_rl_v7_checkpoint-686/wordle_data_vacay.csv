For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)

- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Uses none of S, L, T, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, D, M, G, B, etc.

A word like “RAIND” comes to mind:
- R, A, I, N, D – none of S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- Tests new letters R, I, N, D.

Another option is “CHAIR” (C, H, A, I, R), but A is in position 3 again, which is invalid.  
“MANGO” would have A in position 3, which is also invalid.

“RAINY” is valid (A in 2nd), but Y is less common.  
“RAIND” seems slightly better for testing new letters.

But let’s pick a simpler, more common word: “RADIO”.
- R, A, D, I, O – no S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

But wait, CAMPY has M and P which are good, but let’s see if there’s a better word.

Another option is CUBBY (but B is repeated and Y is at end), or HANKY (H, A, N, K, Y).

HANKY looks good:
- H, A, N, K, Y.
- A is in position 2.
- H, N, K, Y are all new letters.

I’ll go with HANKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Uses none of S, L, T, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, D, M, G, B, etc.

A word like “RAIND” comes to mind:
- R, A, I, N, D – none of S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- Tests new letters R, I, N, D.

Another option is “CHAIR” (C, H, A, I, R), but A is in position 3 again, which is invalid.  
“MANGO” would have A in position 3, which is also invalid.

“RAINY” is valid (A in 2nd), but Y is less common.  
“RAIND” seems slightly better for testing new letters.

But let’s pick a simpler, more common word: “RADIO”.
- R, A, D, I, O – no S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- Tests R, D, I, O.

I’ll go with RADIO.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

2. The letter A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
3. The remaining unknown positions are 1, 3, 4, 5 and they must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter.
- No S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.

Good candidates:
- B, C, G, H, M, N, P, U, W are the most common remaining consonants and vowels.

Possible words:
- CAMPY (C, A, M, P, Y) – uses common letters.
- HUMPH (H, U, M, P, H) – but H is repeated, and we don’t know if H is in the word.
- BUMPY (B, U, M, P, Y) – B is common.
- CANNY (C, A, N, N, Y) – N is repeated, but still valid.

CANNY seems good because:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- C, N, Y are all new letters to test.
- It uses N twice, but we don’t know if N is in the word yet, so it’s a valid test.

However, CANNY has N twice, which might not be optimal. Let’s try CAMPY instead, as it tests C, M, P, Y without repeats.

So the word must contain C exactly once, in position 3 or 4, and the remaining open positions (1 and the other of 3/4) must be filled from the allowed set above.

Possible patterns:  
- C in position 3:   _ A C _ Y  
- C in position 4:   _ A _ C Y  

Let’s list valid English words matching these patterns using only allowed letters:

Pattern 1 (_ A C _ Y):  
- BACCY (slang, but valid) – C repeats, invalid.  
- FACET – E eliminated.  
- No common word fits.

Pattern 2 (_ A _ C Y):  
- B A _ C Y → B is allowed, need a letter for position 3 that is not yet eliminated and forms a word.  
  - B A G C Y → “bagcy” not a word.  
  - B A V C Y → “bavcy” not a word.  
  - B A F C Y → “bafcy” not a word.  
  - B A U C Y → “bau cy” not a word.  
  - B A W C Y → “bawcy” not a word.  

- G A _ C Y → G is allowed.  
  - G A U C Y → “gau cy” not a word.  
  - G A F C Y → “gafcy” not a word.  
  - G A V C Y → “gavcy” not a word.  
  - G A B C Y → “gabcy” not a word.  

- F A _ C Y → F is allowed.  
  - F A U C Y → “faucy” not a word.  
  - F A G C Y → “fagcy” not a word.  

- V A _ C Y → V is allowed.  
  - V A G C Y → “vagcy” not a word.  

- W A _ C Y → W is allowed.  
  - W A G C Y → “wagcy” not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are valid English words.  
Let me double-check the allowed letters and constraints:

Allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4: B, C, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
C must appear once in position 3 or 4.

Looking carefully at pattern _ A _ C Y:

- B A U C Y → “bau cy” → not a word.  
- G A U C Y → “gau cy” → not a word.  
- F A U C Y → “faucy” → not a word.  
- V A U C Y → “vau cy” → not a word.  
- W A U C Y → “wau cy” → not a word.  

Wait, let me check if I missed any valid word:  
- “BAGGY” – G repeats, but G is allowed, yet we already saw it’s invalid because of double G.  
- “FACET” – E eliminated.  
- “GAMBY” – M, B, Y – M is eliminated.  
- “VAPID” – I, D eliminated.  

Actually, the only remaining common letter that hasn’t been eliminated is U (the only vowel left).  
Let me try:

Pattern _ A _ C Y with U:

- B A U C Y → “bau cy” – not a word.  
- F A U C Y → “faucy” – not a word.  
- G A U C Y → “gau cy” – not a word.  
- V A U C Y → “vau cy” – not a word.  
- W A U C Y → “wau cy” – not a word.  

This seems problematic. Did I make an error?

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and previous eliminations:

Letters eliminated so far:  
S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, H, N, K, M, P

Letters still allowed:  
B, C, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

C must be present once, in position 3 or 4.

Let me try pattern _ A C _ Y again with allowed letters:

- B A C _ Y → need a letter for position 4 from allowed set.  
  - B A C G Y → “bacgy” – not a word.  
  - B A C F Y → “bacfy” – not a word.  
  - B A C V Y → “bacvy” – not a word.  
  - B A C U Y → “bacuy” – not a word.  
  - B A C W Y → “bacwy” – not a word.  

- F A C _ Y →  
  - F A C B Y → “facby” – not a word.  

- G A C _ Y →  
  - G A C B Y → “gacby” – not a word.  

- V A C _ Y →  
  - V A C B Y → “vacby” – not a word.  

- W A C _ Y →  
  - W A C B Y → “wacby” – not a word.  

This also yields nothing.

I must have missed a valid word. Let me step back and list all possible combinations that form real 5-letter English words:

Given pattern _ A _ _ Y with C somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and letters restricted:

Possible words:  
- B A C K Y – K eliminated.  
- C A N C Y – N eliminated.  
- V A C C Y – C repeats, but C is allowed.  
  - V A C C Y – valid word “VACCY” (though uncommon).  
- F A C E Y – E eliminated.  
- G A M M Y – M eliminated.  
- W A C K Y – K eliminated.  
- B A C K Y – K eliminated.  

Actually, the only remaining valid word that fits is:

- VACCY (V, A, C, C, Y) – uses C twice, but C is allowed and it’s a valid word (though rare).  

Given the constraints, VACCY appears to be the only possible word left.

Therefore, I will guess VACCY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Uses none of S, L, T, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, D, M, G, B, etc.

A word like “RAIND” comes to mind:
- R, A, I, N, D – none of S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- Tests new letters R, I, N, D.

Another option is “CHAIR” (C, H, A, I, R), but A is in position 3 again, which is invalid.  
“MANGO” would have A in position 3, which is also invalid.

“RAINY” is valid (A in 2nd), but Y is less common.  
“RAIND” seems slightly better for testing new letters.

But let’s pick a simpler, more common word: “RADIO”.
- R, A, D, I, O – no S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- Tests R, D, I, O.

I’ll go with RADIO.

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O (all marked with x).
2. The letter A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
3. The remaining unknown positions are 1, 3, 4, 5 and they must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter.
- No S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.

Good candidates:
- B, C, G, H, M, N, P, U, W are the most common remaining consonants and vowels.

Possible words:
- CAMPY (C, A, M, P, Y) – uses common letters.
- HUMPH (H, U, M, P, H) – but H is repeated, and we don’t know if H is in the word.
- BUMPY (B, U, M, P, Y) – B is common.
- CANNY (C, A, N, N, Y) – N is repeated, but still valid.

CANNY seems good because:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- C, N, Y are all new letters to test.
- It uses N twice, but we don’t know if N is in the word yet, so it’s a valid test.

However, CANNY has N twice, which might not be optimal. Let’s try CAMPY instead, as it tests C, M, P, Y without repeats.

But wait, CAMPY has M and P which are good, but let’s see if there’s a better word.

Another option is CUBBY (but B is repeated and Y is at end), or HANKY (H, A, N, K, Y).

HANKY looks good:
- H, A, N, K, Y.
- A is in position 2.
- H, N, K, Y are all new letters.

I’ll go with HANKY.

Current constraints:

1. Position 2 is A (✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, H, N, K.
3. Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 3 we also learned Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, M, P, V, W.

Good remaining vowel: U (only vowel left).

Possible words:
- BAGGY – G repeats, but G is allowed.
- CAMPY – M, P, C allowed.
- FANCY – N is eliminated.
- VAPID – D, I eliminated.
- WACKY – C allowed, but K is eliminated.
- CAVBY – not a valid word.
- GAMBY – M, B allowed.
- PAPYR – R eliminated.
- CAGGY – G repeats, allowed.

Let’s pick CAMPY again because:
- C, M, P are all new and common.
- Forms a valid word.
- Fits _ A _ _ Y pattern.

Wait, CAMPY has M and P which are good, but let’s see if there’s a better word.

GAMBY: G, M, B are new, but Y is already in position 5.

BAMPY: not a valid word.

CAMPY seems the best available.

But let’s double-check: CAMPY – C, A, M, P, Y. All letters are allowed (C, M, P not eliminated), and it fits the pattern.

So I’ll go with CAMPY.

3. Letters still allowed for positions 1, 3, 4:  
   B, C, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
   (plus any others not yet ruled out)

4. From Guess 4 we learned:  
   - C is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1).  
   Therefore C must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

So the word must contain C exactly once, in position 3 or 4, and the remaining open positions (1 and the other of 3/4) must be filled from the allowed set above.

Possible patterns:  
- C in position 3:   _ A C _ Y  
- C in position 4:   _ A _ C Y  

Let’s list valid English words matching these patterns using only allowed letters:

Pattern 1 (_ A C _ Y):  
- BACCY (slang, but valid) – C repeats, invalid.  
- FACET – E eliminated.  
- No common word fits.

Pattern 2 (_ A _ C Y):  
- B A _ C Y → B is allowed, need a letter for position 3 that is not yet eliminated and forms a word.  
  - B A G C Y → “bagcy” not a word.  
  - B A V C Y → “bavcy” not a word.  
  - B A F C Y → “bafcy” not a word.  
  - B A U C Y → “bau cy” not a word.  
  - B A W C Y → “bawcy” not a word.  

- G A _ C Y → G is allowed.

  - G A F C Y → “gafcy” not a word.  
  - G A V C Y → “gavcy” not a word.

- V A _ C Y → V is allowed.  
  - V A G C Y → “vagcy” not a word.  

- W A _ C Y → W is allowed.  
  - W A G C Y → “wagcy” not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are valid English words.  
Let me double-check the allowed letters and constraints:

Allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4: B, C, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
C must appear once in position 3 or 4.

Looking carefully at pattern _ A _ C Y:

- B A U C Y → “bau cy” → not a word.  
- G A U C Y → “gau cy” → not a word.  
- F A U C Y → “faucy” → not a word.  
- V A U C Y → “vau cy” → not a word.  
- W A U C Y → “wau cy” → not a word.  

Wait, let me check if I missed any valid word:  
- “BAGGY” – G repeats, but G is allowed, yet we already saw it’s invalid because of double G.  
- “FACET” – E eliminated.  
- “GAMBY” – M, B, Y – M is eliminated.  
- “VAPID” – I, D eliminated.  

Actually, the only remaining common letter that hasn’t been eliminated is U (the only vowel left).  
Let me try:

Pattern _ A _ C Y with U:

- B A U C Y → “bau cy” – not a word.  
- F A U C Y → “faucy” – not a word.  
- G A U C Y → “gau cy” – not a word.  
- V A U C Y → “vau cy” – not a word.  
- W A U C Y → “wau cy” – not a word.  

This seems problematic. Did I make an error?

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and previous eliminations:

Letters eliminated so far:  
S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, H, N, K, M, P

Letters still allowed:  
B, C, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

C must be present once, in position 3 or 4.

- W A C _ Y →

This also yields nothing.
