### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" could also work, but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. RABID → R(-) A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct (✓).
   - B is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and D are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).
- B is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, I, D.

Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 3-5.
- Contains B somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s try to place B and R:
- If B is in position 1: B A _ _ _
- If B is in position 4: _ A _ B _
- If B is in position 5: _ A _ _ B

And R must fit into the remaining slots.

Possible candidates:
- B A R _ _ (but then we need two more letters)
- _ A B R _
- _ A _ B R
- _ A R B _
- etc.

Let’s try ""BARON"":
- B in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (fixed ✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O is excluded → invalid.

""BARUM"":
- U is allowed, M is allowed
- B A R U M
- Check letters: B, A, R, U, M – none are excluded (O, S, E, I, D)
- B is in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- U and M are new and allowed
This seems valid.

Another quick check: ""BARUM"" is a valid English word (a currency unit in some countries).

So, ""BARUM"" fits all constraints.

The word must be 5 letters starting with BAR. The remaining letters must come from the allowed set (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z) and form a valid English word.

Valid English words starting with BAR:

- BARLY (ends with LY)
- BARGN (archaic, but 5 letters)
- BARFN (invalid)

From these, ""BARRY"" and ""BARKY"" and ""BARLY"" are the most plausible.

   - R is already in position 3, so position 4 can't be R (no info against it, but let's see)
   - Y is allowed

All three are possible, but ""BARKY"" seems more likely as a word.

However, ""BARRY"" is also valid and uses Y twice, which is allowed.

But let's see if any of these have conflicts:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" could also work, but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" could also work, but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and R.
2. Does not include O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are out).

Let me try a word like ""TRAIN"":
- T: new letter, common
- R: in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) → invalid.

Try ""RAILS"":
- S is excluded → invalid.

Try ""CRANE"":
- E is excluded → invalid.

Try ""RADIO"":
- O is excluded → invalid.

Try ""TAROT"":
- O is excluded → invalid.

Try ""RATIO"":
- O is excluded → invalid.

Try ""RAILY"":
- Y is possible, but let's see.

Wait, better approach: focus on positions.
A cannot be first (position 1), R cannot be second (position 2).

Let's try ""RAILS"" is invalid (S).
""RAIND"":
- D is possible, but ""RAIND"" isn't a word.

""TRAIN"":
- R in position 2 is invalid.

""RABID"":
- B and D are new, no O/S/E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed).

""RABID"" seems valid:
- R (position 1) - allowed
- A (position 2) - allowed
- B, I, D - new letters
No O, S, E included.

This seems like a good next guess.

Guess 2: RABID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. RABID → R(-) A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct (✓).
   - B is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and D are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).
- B is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, I, D.

Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 3-5.
- Contains B somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s try to place B and R:
- If B is in position 1: B A _ _ _
- If B is in position 4: _ A _ B _
- If B is in position 5: _ A _ _ B

And R must fit into the remaining slots.

Possible candidates:
- B A R _ _ (but then we need two more letters)
- _ A B R _
- _ A _ B R
- _ A R B _
- etc.

Let’s try ""BARON"":
- B in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (fixed ✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O is excluded → invalid.

""BARUM"":
- U is allowed, M is allowed
- B A R U M
- Check letters: B, A, R, U, M – none are excluded (O, S, E, I, D)
- B is in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- U and M are new and allowed
This seems valid.

Another quick check: ""BARUM"" is a valid English word (a currency unit in some countries).

So, ""BARUM"" fits all constraints.

4. The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with BAR.

Possible endings:
- BAR + C: BARCC (invalid, not a word)
- BAR + K: BARCK (invalid)

- BAR + Y: BARRY (valid word)
- BAR + T: BART? (needs 5 letters)

- BAR + G: BARGG (invalid)

- BAR + P: BARPP (invalid)
- BAR + K: BARK? (but 4 letters)
- BAR + K + S: BARKS (but S is excluded)
- BAR + K + Y: BARKY (valid)

Wait, let's think systematically:
The word must be 5 letters starting with BAR. The remaining letters must come from the allowed set (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z) and form a valid English word.

Valid English words starting with BAR:
- BARRY (ends with YY)
- BARKY (ends with KY)
- BARLY (ends with LY)
- BARGN (archaic, but 5 letters)
- BARFN (invalid)
- BARCP (invalid)

From these, ""BARRY"" and ""BARKY"" and ""BARLY"" are the most plausible.

Check constraints:
- BARRY: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(?) Y(?)
   - R is already in position 3, so position 4 can't be R (no info against it, but let's see)
   - Y is allowed
- BARKY: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(?) Y(?)
   - K and Y are allowed
- BARLY: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) L(?) Y(?)
   - L and Y are allowed

All three are possible, but ""BARKY"" seems more likely as a word.

However, ""BARRY"" is also valid and uses Y twice, which is allowed.

But let's see if any of these have conflicts:
- BARRY: positions 1-4: B A R R - but we know position 3 is R, so position 4 could be R
- BARKY: positions 1-5: B A R K Y
- BARLY: positions 1-5: B A R L Y

All seem valid. Since we have two guesses left, let's try ""BARKY"" first.

Confirmed facts so far:
- Pattern: B A R _ Y
- Position 4 must be a letter that is:
  – not in {O, S, E, I, D, U, M, K, L}
  – and still leave a valid English word.

Allowed letters for position 4: C, F, G, H, J, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Scanning the dictionary for “BAR _ Y” with those letters:
- BARCY – valid (British slang for “barrel of yeast”)
- BARFY – not a standard word
- BARGY – variant spelling of “bargy” (slang for “bargain” or “bargle”)
- BARNY – not a word
- BARPY – not a word
- BARVY – not a word
- BARCH – doesn’t end in Y
- BARJY – not a word
- BARNY – not a word
- BARPY – not a word
- BARVY – not a word

The only fully valid remaining candidate is BARCY.
