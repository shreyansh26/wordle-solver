For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the best starting words for Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" are also strong contenders, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered an optimal starting word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, L, A but none of them are in their guessed positions.
- The word definitely does NOT contain T or E.

Since S, L, A must appear somewhere else, I should try to place them in new positions while introducing other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like R, I, N, O, C, etc.).

A good next guess would be one that:
1. Keeps S, L, A but shifts their positions.
2. Adds new high-frequency letters not yet tested (R, I, N, O).
3. Avoids T and E.

One such word is “RAINS”:
- R (new letter)
- A (moved to position 2)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- S (moved to position 5)

This tests three new letters (R, I, N) while repositioning A and S and removing L (because L was only in position 2 and we know it’s in the word but not there; we can test it in a new spot in a later guess). Actually, since L is confirmed in the word but not in position 2, I should include L in the next guess.

Let me rethink: I need to include L somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5) and also include A and S in new positions.

A better word might be “PLANS”:
- P (new letter)
- L (moved to position 1)
- A (moved to position 3)
- N (new letter)
- S (moved to position 5)

This includes L in position 1 (new), A in position 3 (new), and S in position 5 (new), while testing P and N.

2. The word contains P, L, A but none of them are in their currently tested positions.
   - P cannot be first (from PLANS) and also cannot be in the same positions as before (but we already know positions 1,2,3,4 for P from PLANS? Wait, no - P was only tested in position 1 in PLANS, so P cannot be first, but can be in 2,3,4).
   - L cannot be second (from PLANS) and also cannot be in position 2 again, but from SLATE L was in position 2, so L cannot be in position 2 at all. From PLANS, L was in position 2 again, so same conclusion: L cannot be second.
   - A cannot be third (from PLANS) and also cannot be in position 3 again, but from SLATE A was in position 3, so A cannot be third at all.

4: Not L (from PLANS L was second), T, E, N, P (from PLANS P was first, but P can be fourth).
5: S (confirmed).

We have to place P, L, A in positions 1,2,3,4 with the constraints:

- A in 1 (allowed), P in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed), U (new letter), S in 5 (correct).
This tests A in 1, P in 2, L in 3, and introduces U.

Another option: ""ALPUS""
- A in 1, L in 2 (but L cannot be second), so invalid.

- A is allowed in 1
- P is allowed in 2
- L is allowed in 3
- U is new
- S is correct in 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the best starting words for Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" are also strong contenders, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered an optimal starting word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, L, A but none of them are in their guessed positions.
- The word definitely does NOT contain T or E.

Since S, L, A must appear somewhere else, I should try to place them in new positions while introducing other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like R, I, N, O, C, etc.).

A good next guess would be one that:
1. Keeps S, L, A but shifts their positions.
2. Adds new high-frequency letters not yet tested (R, I, N, O).
3. Avoids T and E.

One such word is “RAINS”:
- R (new letter)
- A (moved to position 2)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- S (moved to position 5)

This tests three new letters (R, I, N) while repositioning A and S and removing L (because L was only in position 2 and we know it’s in the word but not there; we can test it in a new spot in a later guess). Actually, since L is confirmed in the word but not in position 2, I should include L in the next guess.

Let me rethink: I need to include L somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5) and also include A and S in new positions.

A better word might be “PLANS”:
- P (new letter)
- L (moved to position 1)
- A (moved to position 3)
- N (new letter)
- S (moved to position 5)

This includes L in position 1 (new), A in position 3 (new), and S in position 5 (new), while testing P and N.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANS -> FEEDBACK: P(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PLANS:
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- N is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word AND in the correct position (fifth).

So we now know:
1. The word ends with S: _ _ _ _ S
2. The word contains P, L, A but none of them are in their currently tested positions.
   - P cannot be first (from PLANS) and also cannot be in the same positions as before (but we already know positions 1,2,3,4 for P from PLANS? Wait, no - P was only tested in position 1 in PLANS, so P cannot be first, but can be in 2,3,4).
   - L cannot be second (from PLANS) and also cannot be in position 2 again, but from SLATE L was in position 2, so L cannot be in position 2 at all. From PLANS, L was in position 2 again, so same conclusion: L cannot be second.
   - A cannot be third (from PLANS) and also cannot be in position 3 again, but from SLATE A was in position 3, so A cannot be third at all.
3. Letters not in the word: T, E, N.

So positions:
1: Not S, T, E, N, P (since P can't be first), L (can't be second, but can be first), A (can't be third, but can be first).
2: Not L (from PLANS and SLATE), T, E, N, P (from PLANS P was first, but P can be second).
3: Not A (from PLANS and SLATE), T, E, N, P (from PLANS P was first, but P can be third).
4: Not L (from PLANS L was second), T, E, N, P (from PLANS P was first, but P can be fourth).
5: S (confirmed).

We have to place P, L, A in positions 1,2,3,4 with the constraints:
- P: not first (from PLANS), so can be 2,3,4
- L: not second (from PLANS and SLATE), so can be 1,3,4
- A: not third (from PLANS and SLATE), so can be 1,2,4

Possible placements:
Looking for words ending in S with P, L, A in positions 1,2,3,4.

Let's try ""APLUS"":
- A in 1 (allowed), P in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed), U (new letter), S in 5 (correct).
This tests A in 1, P in 2, L in 3, and introduces U.

But wait, does ""APLUS"" contain all required letters? We need P, L, A in the word (yes), and S in position 5 (yes). Also avoids T,E,N.

Another option: ""ALPUS""
- A in 1, L in 2 (but L cannot be second), so invalid.

""PLAUS"":
- P in 1 (invalid, P cannot be first).

""PLAS"" is only 4 letters.

""PARLS"":
- P in 1 (invalid).

""CLAPS"":
- C (new), L in 2 (invalid).

""GLAPS"":
- G (new), L in 2 (invalid).

""FLAPS"":
- F (new), L in 2 (invalid).

""BLAPS"":
- B (new), L in 2 (invalid).

""PLAZS"" - invalid.

""PLANS"" already tried.

""SLAPS"":
- S in 1 (invalid, S is in 5), and L in 2 (invalid).

""CLASP"":
- Doesn't end with S.

""ALPAS"":
- A in 1, L in 2 (invalid).

""APLAS"":
- A in 1, P in 2, L in 3, A in 4 (but A can't be third, but 4 is ok), S in 5.
This has two A's, which might be allowed, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates.

""APLUS"" seems best so far:
A(1), P(2), L(3), U(4), S(5)
- A is allowed in 1
- P is allowed in 2
- L is allowed in 3
- U is new
- S is correct in 5

This tests P in 2, L in 3, A in 1, and introduces U.

- U is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with S: _ _ _ _ S
2. The word contains A, P, L but none of them are in their currently tested positions.
   - A cannot be first (from APLUS) and also cannot be third (from PLANS and SLATE), so A must be in position 2 or 4.
   - P cannot be second (from APLUS) and also cannot be first (from PLANS), so P must be in position 3 or 4.
   - L cannot be second (from PLANS and SLATE) and also cannot be third (from APLUS), so L must be in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters not in the word: T, E, N, U.

We have four positions to fill (1-4) with A, P, L and two other letters that haven't been ruled out (common ones: R, I, O, C, D, etc.).

Possible placements:
- A must be 2 or 4
- P must be 3 or 4
- L must be 1 or 4

Let's consider the possible overlaps for position 4:
If position 4 is A, then P must be 3 and L must be 1 → L _ P A S
If position 4 is P, then A must be 2 and L must be 1 → L A P P S (invalid, P duplicated)
Or L must be 1, A must be 2, P must be 4 → L A _ P S (but P must be 3 or 4, so 4 is ok, but then who is in 3?)
Wait, if P is 4, then A must be 2, and L must be 1 or 4. 4 is taken by P, so L must be 1 → L A _ P S, leaving position 3 to be filled by another letter not yet used (not T,E,N,U,S,A,P,L). Common unused letters: R, I, O, C, D.

Looking at L A _ P S:
Possible words: LARPS, LAIPS, LAOPC... but LARPS is a valid word (LARPS are larp, a gaming term), but might be obscure. LAIPS isn't a word. LAOP isn't valid.

Alternative: position 4 is A, then:
L _ P A S → L _ P A S. Position 2 must be A or another letter, but A is already in 4. Wait, no: A is allowed to appear twice? The feedback didn't say no duplicates. So L _ P A S. Position 2 can be any unused letter not yet ruled out (not T,E,N,U,S,A,P,L). Common ones: R, I, O, C, D.

Looking at L _ P A S:
- LRPAS - not a word
- LIPAS - not a word
- LO PAS - not a word
- LCPAS - not a word
- LDPAS - not a word

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe position 4 is A, and position 3 is L, but L cannot be third (from APLUS). So that's invalid.

Alternative: position 4 is P, then:
A must be 2, L must be 1 → L A _ P S. As above.

Alternative: position 2 is A, then:
P must be 3 or 4, L must be 1 or 4.
If P is 3, L must be 1 or 4. If L is 1 → L A P _ S, then position 4 must be P (but P is 3), or another letter. But we have A,P,L,S accounted for, so position 4 must be a new letter. So L A P _ S. The blank must be a new letter not yet used (not T,E,N,U,S,A,P,L). Common ones: R, I, O, C, D.

Looking at L A P _ S:
- LAPRS - not a word
- LAPIS - this is a valid word (LAPIS is a type of stone or the plural of lapis)
- LAPIS fits: L(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), S(5)
   - L: allowed in 1 (was invalid in 2,3,5)
