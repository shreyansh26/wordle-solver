For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters and cover multiple vowels. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but E cannot be the last letter.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are completely excluded.
3. The remaining alphabet is still open except for those four letters and the 5th position for E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
- Does **not** use S, L, A, T.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, M, P, D, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s pick a word that includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the banned letters.  
A strong candidate is “CRIME”:
- C, R, I, M are still allowed.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- It’s a common word and tests new letters.

- Contains E in position 1, 3, or 4
- Uses only letters from the allowed set

Candidate words fitting this pattern:

- GREED (E in position 4, but D is allowed)

- GREET (but T is out)
- BROKE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so this is invalid)
- DROVE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so invalid)
- GROVE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so invalid)

The best option that fits all constraints is “GREED”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters and cover multiple vowels. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but E cannot be the last letter.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are completely excluded.
3. The remaining alphabet is still open except for those four letters and the 5th position for E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
- Does **not** use S, L, A, T.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, M, P, D, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s pick a word that includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the banned letters.  
A strong candidate is “CRIME”:
- C, R, I, M are still allowed.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- It’s a common word and tests new letters.

So:  
<guess>CRIME</guess>

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, I, M  
Letters that ARE in the word: R (in position 2), E (somewhere except position 5)  

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _  and E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: O, U (E is already confirmed, A and I are out)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Contains E in position 1, 3, or 4
- Uses only letters from the allowed set

Candidate words fitting this pattern:
- BERRY (but Y is sometimes vowel, and we’d prefer to test more consonants)
- FERRY (same issue with Y)
- GREED (E in position 4, but D is allowed)
- BREAD (but A is out)
- GREET (but T is out)
- BROKE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so this is invalid)
- DROVE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so invalid)
- GROVE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so invalid)

The best option that fits all constraints is “GREED”:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- E appears in position 4 (allowed)
- Letters G, D have not been tested yet
- No banned letters are used

It appears the only remaining valid word fitting the pattern is “FREER”, even though it repeats R. Since R is already confirmed in position 2, having another R in position 5 is permissible unless explicitly ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is FREER.",Guess 5: FREER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters and cover multiple vowels. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but E cannot be the last letter.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are completely excluded.
3. The remaining alphabet is still open except for those four letters and the 5th position for E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
- Does **not** use S, L, A, T.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, M, P, D, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s pick a word that includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the banned letters.  
A strong candidate is “CRIME”:
- C, R, I, M are still allowed.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- It’s a common word and tests new letters.

So:  
<guess>CRIME</guess>

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, I, M  
Letters that ARE in the word: R (in position 2), E (somewhere except position 5)  

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _  and E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: O, U (E is already confirmed, A and I are out)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Contains E in position 1, 3, or 4
- Uses only letters from the allowed set

Candidate words fitting this pattern:
- BERRY (but Y is sometimes vowel, and we’d prefer to test more consonants)
- FERRY (same issue with Y)
- GREED (E in position 4, but D is allowed)
- BREAD (but A is out)
- GREET (but T is out)
- BROKE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so this is invalid)
- DROVE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so invalid)
- GROVE (E in position 5 is forbidden, so invalid)

The best option that fits all constraints is “GREED”:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- E appears in position 4 (allowed)
- Letters G, D have not been tested yet
- No banned letters are used

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(x) M(x) E(-)
Guess 3: GREED -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) E(✓) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on GREED:
- G and D are NOT in the word (x).
- R is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- E is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- The second E is also confirmed in position 4 (✓).

So the current known pattern is: _ R E E _  (positions 2, 3, 4 are fixed).

Letters still excluded: S, L, A, T, C, I, M, G, D  
Letters still allowed: B, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels O, U (E is already used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has E in position 3
- Has E in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters for positions 1 and 5

Possible patterns: ? R E E ? where ? is any allowed letter.

Looking for common words fitting _ R E E _:
- BREE? – no common words
- F R E E ? – “FREER” (valid but uncommon)
- H R E E ? – none
- N R E E ? – none
- P R E E ? – “PREEN” (but N is allowed, let’s check)
- V R E E ? – none
- W R E E ? – “WREED” (invalid)
- B R E E ? – “BREEB” (invalid)
- F R E E ? – “FREER” (valid but rare)
- P R E E ? – “PREEN” (N is allowed, E is already used)

The best valid word fitting the pattern is “PREEN”:
- P (allowed in position 1)
- R (position 2, correct)
- E (position 3, correct)
- E (position 4, correct)
- N (allowed in position 5)

Let’s use “PREEN”.

Current confirmed facts:
- Word pattern: _ R E E _   (R in 2, E in 3 & 4)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, I, M, G, D, P, N
- Remaining allowed letters for positions 1 & 5: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels O, U (E is already used).

We need a valid English 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Has E in positions 3 and 4
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters in positions 1 and 5.

Scanning possibilities:
- B R E E ? – no valid word
- F R E E ? – “FREER” (but R already in position 2, and second R not confirmed)
- H R E E ? – none
- J R E E ? – none
- K R E E ? – “KREE?” – nothing
- Q R E E ? – none
- V R E E ? – none
- W R E E ? – none
- X R E E ? – none
- Y R E E ? – none
- Z R E E ? – none

Looking at vowels for position 1 and 5:
- O and U are the only remaining vowels.

Possible words:
- O R E E ? – “OREE?” – none
- U R E E ? – “UREE?” – none
- O R E E O – “OREEO” – invalid
- U R E E U – invalid

Re-examining: perhaps I missed a word. The pattern is ? R E E ?.

Valid English words fitting ? R E E ?:
- BREAD – A excluded
- CREEK – C, K excluded
- DREEL – D excluded
- FREAK – A, K excluded
- GREEE – invalid
- JREED – invalid
- KREED – invalid
- PREEN – P, N excluded
- TREAD – T excluded
- WREED – W allowed, but D excluded
- BREAD – A excluded
- CREEK – C excluded
- DREEL – D excluded
- FREAK – A excluded
- GREEE – invalid
- JREED – invalid
- KREED – invalid
- PREEN – excluded
- TREAD – excluded
- WREED – D excluded

Wait, let’s list all remaining letters for positions 1 and 5:
Allowed: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, O, U.

We need a word like ? R E E ? using these letters.

Looking systematically:
- B R E E ? – no valid word
- F R E E ? – “FREER” (but second R not confirmed)
- H R E E ? – none
- J R E E ? – none
- K R E E ? – none
- Q R E E ? – none
- V R E E ? – none
- W R E E ? – none
- X R E E ? – none
- Y R E E ? – none
- Z R E E ? – none
- O R E E ? – none
- U R E E ? – none

It appears the only remaining valid word fitting the pattern is “FREER”, even though it repeats R. Since R is already confirmed in position 2, having another R in position 5 is permissible unless explicitly ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is FREER.
