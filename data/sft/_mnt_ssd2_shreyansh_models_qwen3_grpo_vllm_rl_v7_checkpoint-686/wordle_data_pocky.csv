### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E
- DOES contain O, but not in position 3

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3)
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out)

A word like ""POINT"" uses P, I, N, T plus O in position 2. This covers common letters and positions.

Let me check:
- P, I, N, T: all new letters
- O: we know it's in the word, testing position 2
- No A, R, S, E

“POUND” uses U, N, D.  
But N is already ruled out (x in POINT), so N is forbidden.

Next candidate: “POUCH” – uses U, C, H.  
All letters are allowed: P, O (correct positions), U, C, H have not been marked x.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern so far: P O _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, H
- Letters that ARE in the word: P (pos 1), O (pos 2), C (somewhere, but not pos 4)

Remaining unused common letters: B, D, F, G, L, M, Y, W, K, etc.
Vowels left: none useful (A, E, I, U are out).

We need three more letters for positions 3-5, none of which are forbidden, and C must appear in one of them (but not in position 4).

Possible placements for C:
- Position 3: C _ _ (but then position 4 would be free)
- Position 5: _ _ _ C

Let’s try C in position 3: P O C _ _
We need two more letters from the allowed set. Good candidates: B, D, F, G, L, M, Y.

A common word that fits: P O C K Y – but Y is less common.
Another: P O C K S – but S is forbidden.
P O C K D – not a word.
P O C K B – not a word.

C in position 5: P O _ _ C
Possible: P O W D C – not a word.
P O L K C – not a word.
P O D G C – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching P O _ _ C:
- POKER – but E is forbidden.
- POLIC – not a word.
- POKYC – not a word.

C in position 3 seems better. Let’s find a valid word: P O C _ _
- POKED – E is forbidden.
- POCHE – E, H forbidden.
- POCIT – I, T forbidden.
- POCUL – not common.
- POCHE – already ruled out.

Alternative: C in position 4 is impossible (feedback said C is in word but not in position 4). So C must be in 3 or 5.

Let’s try C in position 3 and pick from remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, L, M, Y.

A valid word: P O C K Y – but Y is low frequency.
Another: P O C K S – S forbidden.
P O C K B – not a word.
P O C K D – not a word.

Wait, let’s try C in position 5: P O _ _ C
Valid word: P O W D C – no.
P O L K C – no.
P O D G C – no.

Actually, let’s try C in position 3 with different consonants:
P O C K Y – valid but Y is last letter.
P O C K D – not a word.
P O C K F – not a word.

Let me think of other valid words: P O C _ _
- POKED – E forbidden.
- POCHE – E, H forbidden.
- POKER – E forbidden.
- POCIT – I, T forbidden.
- POCUL – not common.
- POCKE – E forbidden.

Hmm, seems limited. Let’s try C in position 5 again:
P O _ _ C
Valid word: P O W D C – no.
P O L K C – no.
P O D G C – no.

Wait, let’s try P O D G Y – but G and Y are fine, but no C.

We must include C. Let me re-examine C placement:
C cannot be in position 4 (feedback says so). So possible positions: 3 or 5.

For position 3: P O C _ _
We need two more letters from allowed set: B, D, F, G, L, M, Y.
Valid word: P O C K Y – but is this valid? Yes, ""pooky"" is slang but 5 letters.
But let’s pick more standard: P O C K D – no.
P O C K F – no.

Alternative: P O C L Y – not a word.
P O C M Y – no.

For position 5: P O _ _ C
Valid word: P O L K C – no.
P O W D C – no.

Let me try P O D G Y – but no C.

I realize I missed: P O C K Y is actually valid (slang but acceptable for Wordle). Let’s go with that.

But let me check another: P O C K B – no.

Another approach: use remaining consonants B, D, F, G, L, M, Y with C in position 3 or 5.

Best valid word seems P O C K Y.

But let me verify: P O C K Y – letters: P, O, C, K, Y. All allowed (no forbidden letters), and C is in position 3 (allowed).

So I’ll guess P O C K Y.

Wait, let me check if there’s a more common word: P O C _ _
- POKED – E forbidden.
- POCHE – E, H forbidden.
- POKER – E forbidden.
- POCIT – I, T forbidden.
- POCUL – not common.
- POCKE – E forbidden.

So P O C K Y seems the only valid option.

But let me try C in position 5 with different letters:
P O B L C – not a word.
P O D L C – not a word.
P O G L C – not a word.

Thus, P O C K Y is the best next guess.

But let me think again: maybe P O D G Y – but no C.

We must include C. So P O C K Y is the way.

But let me check if P O C K Y is a valid Wordle word – yes, it’s accepted.

Therefore, I’ll guess P O C K Y.
