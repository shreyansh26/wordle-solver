For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. This can give us good coverage to identify which letters are present.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
We still need to find the first four letters.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong second guess that uses new common letters and keeps the known E in place is “UNTIE”.  
It tests U, N, T, I while keeping E fixed at the end.  
Other candidates like “LINED”, “PINED”, or “TUBED” are also possible, but “UNTIE” gives good coverage.

I’ll choose “UNTIE”.

Current knowledge:

- Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

So far we have:
_ _ _ L E
with L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining common consonants to test: B, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: none left (only E is allowed).

We need three new consonants for positions 1, 2, 3 (or 1,3,4 if L is in 4).  
A good next guess should place L in a new spot and test fresh consonants.

Option 1: Place L in position 1 → L _ _ _ E
Option 2: Place L in position 3 → _ _ L _ E
Option 3: Place L in position 4 → _ _ _ L E (but position 4 is already L, so we’d need to test new letters in 1,2,3)

Let’s try option 2: place L in position 3, then test two new consonants in 1 and 2.

Candidate words:
- BLOWE (but O is already excluded)
- FLEME (M is allowed, but double E is not a word)
- GLEEM (M is allowed, and G, E, E, M are all allowed so far)

“GLEEM” is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a gleam or sparkle).  
It uses G, L, E, M, E: G and M are new consonants, L is known to be in the word, and E is fixed at the end.

So:
- Position 1: G (new)
- Position 2: L (known to be in word, testing position 2)
- Position 3: E (allowed, since E can repeat)
- Position 4: M (new)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

This seems optimal.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. This can give us good coverage to identify which letters are present.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
We still need to find the first four letters.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong second guess that uses new common letters and keeps the known E in place is “UNTIE”.  
It tests U, N, T, I while keeping E fixed at the end.  
Other candidates like “LINED”, “PINED”, or “TUBED” are also possible, but “UNTIE” gives good coverage.

Let's summarize what we now know:

1. Position 5 is definitely E.
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D, G, M.
3. Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since L(-) appeared in both CLYDE and GLEEM).
4. Therefore L must be in position 1 or 4.
5. The remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden ones) are: B, E, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Among these, E is already known to be in position 5, and the rest are consonants (except E which is used).

So the word structure must be:
- If L is in position 1: L _ _ _ E
- If L is in position 4: _ _ _ L E

We need to test the remaining consonants in the remaining positions. Let's try L in position 1 first, and pick three new consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, H, K, P, V, W, etc.).

A good candidate would be ""BLEVE"" (but V and B are new, E is repeated which is allowed since E is already known). However, ""BLEVE"" is a valid word (means to blister or scald). Alternatively, ""FLAKE"" but A and K are allowed, but A is forbidden. So ""FLAKE"" is invalid due to A. 

Next option: ""PHLEB"" but this is not a valid word. ""VLEPP"" is not valid. 

Looking for valid words: ""BLEVE"" seems valid. Let's check if there are better options. 

Another approach: since we have limited consonants left, let's try ""BLEVE"" as it uses B, L, E, V, E. B and V are new, L is known to be in word, E is fixed.

But wait, let's verify ""BLEVE"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it's recognized (archaic term for blister, but accepted in dictionaries).

However, let's consider ""FLECK"" but C is forbidden. ""PLEBE"" but B and P are new, E is fixed. 

Actually, let's try ""FLEVE"" but this is not a valid word. ""PLEVE"" is not valid. 

Looking again, ""BLEVE"" seems the best option with remaining letters.

But let's also consider ""VLEBE"" which is not valid. 

Another valid word: ""BLEED"" but D is forbidden. 

""BLEVE"" seems to be the only valid option here. 

But let's check if we can do better with L in position 4. For example, _ _ _ L E. The first three positions must be filled with remaining consonants. 

Possible word: ""FABLE"" but A is forbidden. ""HABLE"" not valid. ""PABLE"" not valid. ""WABLE"" not valid. 

""KELLE"" but K is allowed, but E is repeated. ""KELLE"" is a valid word (variant of ""kelle"" in some dialects). 

But ""KELLE"" uses K, E, L, L, E. K is new, L is known to be in word, E is fixed. This seems valid. 

Between ""BLEVE"" and ""KELLE"", both are valid, but ""KELLE"" places L in position 4 which we haven't tested yet. 

Let's go with ""KELLE"" as it tests K in position 1 and confirms L in position 4.

- Position 3: E (allowed, since E can repeat)
- Position 4: M (new)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

This seems optimal.

Let's summarize what we now know:

1. Position 5 is definitely E.
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D, G, M.
3. Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since L(-) appeared in both CLYDE and GLEEM).
4. Therefore L must be in position 1 or 4.
5. The remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden ones) are: B, E, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Among these, E is already known to be in position 5, and the rest are consonants (except E which is used).

So the word structure must be:
- If L is in position 1: L _ _ _ E
- If L is in position 4: _ _ _ L E

We need to test the remaining consonants in the remaining positions. Let's try L in position 1 first, and pick three new consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, H, K, P, V, W, etc.).

A good candidate would be ""BLEVE"" (but V and B are new, E is repeated which is allowed since E is already known). However, ""BLEVE"" is a valid word (means to blister or scald). Alternatively, ""FLAKE"" but A and K are allowed, but A is forbidden. So ""FLAKE"" is invalid due to A. 

Next option: ""PHLEB"" but this is not a valid word. ""VLEPP"" is not valid. 

Looking for valid words: ""BLEVE"" seems valid. Let's check if there are better options. 

Another approach: since we have limited consonants left, let's try ""BLEVE"" as it uses B, L, E, V, E. B and V are new, L is known to be in word, E is fixed.

But wait, let's verify ""BLEVE"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it's recognized (archaic term for blister, but accepted in dictionaries).

However, let's consider ""FLECK"" but C is forbidden. ""PLEBE"" but B and P are new, E is fixed. 

Actually, let's try ""FLEVE"" but this is not a valid word. ""PLEVE"" is not valid. 

Looking again, ""BLEVE"" seems the best option with remaining letters.

But let's also consider ""VLEBE"" which is not valid. 

Another valid word: ""BLEED"" but D is forbidden. 

""BLEVE"" seems to be the only valid option here. 

But let's check if we can do better with L in position 4. For example, _ _ _ L E. The first three positions must be filled with remaining consonants. 

Possible word: ""FABLE"" but A is forbidden. ""HABLE"" not valid. ""PABLE"" not valid. ""WABLE"" not valid. 

""KELLE"" but K is allowed, but E is repeated. ""KELLE"" is a valid word (variant of ""kelle"" in some dialects). 

But ""KELLE"" uses K, E, L, L, E. K is new, L is known to be in word, E is fixed. This seems valid. 

Between ""BLEVE"" and ""KELLE"", both are valid, but ""KELLE"" places L in position 4 which we haven't tested yet. 

Let's go with ""KELLE"" as it tests K in position 1 and confirms L in position 4.

From the latest feedback:

- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Position 3 is L (✓) – so the word is now: _ _ L _ E
- Position 4 is L (-) – so L is NOT in position 4 (but we already know it’s in position 3).
- E is in positions 2 and 5 (✓), so the word has the pattern: _ E L _ E

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D, G, M, K.

Remaining consonants to test: B, F, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need a consonant for position 1 and another for position 4.

Possible words matching _ E L _ E:
- B E L L E – but double L is already in position 3, and we don’t know if L repeats. Also, ""BELLE"" is valid.
- F E L L E – same issue with double L.
- H E L L E – same.
- P E L V E – but V is allowed and ""PELVE"" is not a valid word.
- V E L P E – ""VELPE"" is not valid.
- W E L V E – ""WELVE"" is not valid.

The only valid word fitting _ E L _ E with remaining letters is ""BELLE"".

Let’s verify:
- B is new (not used before).
- E is in position 2 (✓).
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- Second E in position 5 (✓).
- B and L are allowed.

Thus, ""BELLE"" is the logical next guess.
