For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

Common letters in English include: A, E, T, R, S, N, I, O, L, C, U, Y. A good starting word should use several of these.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps determine which vowels are in the word
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English words
4. It has no repeated letters, giving us maximum information

This should give us a strong foundation to narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 1.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven't tested yet.

Letters we have not used yet (common ones): T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

- Includes A (but not in position 1).
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TAINT"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

Common letters in English include: A, E, T, R, S, N, I, O, L, C, U, Y. A good starting word should use several of these.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps determine which vowels are in the word
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English words
4. It has no repeated letters, giving us maximum information

This should give us a strong foundation to narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 1.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven't tested yet.

Letters we have not used yet (common ones): T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We want a word that:
- Includes A (but not in position 1).
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TAINT"":
- A is in position 2 (not position 1), satisfying the feedback.
- Uses T, I, N which are common letters we haven't tested.
- Has no excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

From the new feedback on YAMBL:
- A(✓) and M(✓) remain locked in positions 2 and 3.
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- B is NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A M _ _
Letters still allowed: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J, plus Y and L must be placed somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since 1 is now ruled out for Y, and 2,3 are fixed).

We have two unknown slots: 1 and 4 (or 5). We need a valid word fitting _ A M _ _ that uses Y and/or L in positions 4 or 5, and only the remaining letters elsewhere.

Candidate words:
- F A M Y _  → but we need a valid word, FAMYS isn’t valid.
- H A M L Y → HAMLY isn’t a word.
- G A M L Y → GAMLY isn’t a word.
- D A M P Y → P is excluded.
- V A M P Y → P excluded.
- L A M B Y → B excluded.
- Y A M _ _ → but A is fixed in 2, so invalid.
- K A M P Y → P excluded.
- U A M L Y → UAMLY isn’t a word.
- F A M B Y → B excluded.
- G A M E Y → E excluded.
- D A M L Y → DAMLY isn’t a word.

Let’s try L in position 4 and Y in position 5: _ A M L Y
We need a valid letter for position 1 from remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Valid word: H A M L Y → HAMLY (not valid)
F A M L Y → FAMLY (not valid)
G A M L Y → GAMLY (not valid)
D A M L Y → DAMLY (not valid)

Try L in position 5 and Y in position 4: _ A M Y L
Valid word: F A M Y L → FAMYL (not valid)
H A M Y L → HAMY L (not valid)
G A M Y L → GAMYL (not valid)

Wait, let’s list actual English words fitting _ A M _ _ with remaining letters:
- DAMMY (but M is already in 3, and Y is allowed in 5: DAMMY has M in 3 and 4, but 4 would be M, which is already in 3 – duplicate M, but that’s allowed. However, Y must be in the word somewhere, and DAMMY has no Y.)
- HAMMY – same issue, no Y.
- KAMAL – has L in 5 and Y in 4: K A M A L – but A is already in 2, and this has A in 4, which is allowed. But does it have Y? No.

We need Y somewhere. Let me re-examine:
The word must contain Y (from Y(✓) in guess 3), and Y cannot be in position 1 (from Y(-) in guess 4). So Y must be in position 4 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. _ A M Y _
2. _ A M _ Y

For pattern 1 (_ A M Y _):
Need a valid letter for position 1 and 5 from remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Valid word: F A M Y _ → FAMY? Not valid.
H A M Y _ → HAMY? Not valid.
D A M Y _ → DAMY? Not valid.
K A M Y _ → KAMY? Not valid.

For pattern 2 (_ A M _ Y):
Need a valid letter for position 1 and 4.
Valid word: F A M _ Y → FAM_Y → FAMY? No.
H A M _ Y → HAM_Y → HAMY? No.
D A M _ Y → DAM_Y → DAMY? No.
K A M _ Y → KAM_Y → KAMY? No.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must contain Y and L, with Y not in 1 and L not in 5. So possible placements:
- Y in 4, L in 5: _ A M Y L → need valid word: H A M Y L? No.
- Y in 5, L in 4: _ A M L Y → need valid word: H A M L Y? No.
- Y in 5, L in 1: L A M _ Y → L A M _ Y → LAM _ Y → LAMY? No.

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-list remaining letters after exclusions:
Excluded: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, B, and now B is excluded from YAMBL feedback.
Remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J, Y, L.

Looking for actual English words:
- H A M L Y → not valid.
- F A M L Y → not valid.
- D A M L Y → not valid.
- K A M L Y → not valid.

Wait, let me try G A M L Y → GAMLY? No.
H A M L Y → HAMLY? No.

I think the only valid word fitting is H A M L Y, but it’s not recognized. Maybe I need to try K A M P Y, but P is excluded.

Let me try D A M P Y again – P excluded.

Actually, let me try J A M B Y – B excluded.

F A M B Y – B excluded.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me try F A M U Y – U is allowed, but FAMU Y isn’t a word.

Wait, let me try H A M M Y – has double M, but M is allowed twice, and Y is in 5: HAMMY – this is a valid word!

Check constraints:
- Pattern: _ A M _ Y
- H is allowed (not excluded).
- A in 2, M in 3, Y in 5.
- No excluded letters used.

Thus, HAMMY fits all constraints.

- A(✓) and M(✓) remain locked in positions 2 and 3.
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- B is NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A M _ _
Letters still allowed: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J, plus Y and L must be placed somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since 1 is now ruled out for Y, and 2,3 are fixed).

We have two unknown slots: 1 and 4 (or 5). We need a valid word fitting _ A M _ _ that uses Y and/or L in positions 4 or 5, and only the remaining letters elsewhere.

Let’s try L in position 4 and Y in position 5: _ A M L Y

Valid word: H A M L Y → HAMLY (not valid)
F A M L Y → FAMLY (not valid)
G A M L Y → GAMLY (not valid)
D A M L Y → DAMLY (not valid)

Try L in position 5 and Y in position 4: _ A M Y L
Valid word: F A M Y L → FAMYL (not valid)
H A M Y L → HAMY L (not valid)
G A M Y L → GAMYL (not valid)

Wait, let’s list actual English words fitting _ A M _ _ with remaining letters:
- DAMMY (but M is already in 3, and Y is allowed in 5: DAMMY has M in 3 and 4, but 4 would be M, which is already in 3 – duplicate M, but that’s allowed. However, Y must be in the word somewhere, and DAMMY has no Y.)
- HAMMY – same issue, no Y.
- KAMAL – has L in 5 and Y in 4: K A M A L – but A is already in 2, and this has A in 4, which is allowed. But does it have Y? No.

We need Y somewhere. Let me re-examine:
The word must contain Y (from Y(✓) in guess 3), and Y cannot be in position 1 (from Y(-) in guess 4). So Y must be in position 4 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. _ A M Y _
2. _ A M _ Y

For pattern 1 (_ A M Y _):
Need a valid letter for position 1 and 5 from remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Valid word: F A M Y _ → FAMY? Not valid.
H A M Y _ → HAMY? Not valid.
D A M Y _ → DAMY? Not valid.
K A M Y _ → KAMY? Not valid.

For pattern 2 (_ A M _ Y):
Need a valid letter for position 1 and 4.
Valid word: F A M _ Y → FAM_Y → FAMY? No.
H A M _ Y → HAM_Y → HAMY? No.
D A M _ Y → DAM_Y → DAMY? No.
K A M _ Y → KAM_Y → KAMY? No.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must contain Y and L, with Y not in 1 and L not in 5. So possible placements:
- Y in 4, L in 5: _ A M Y L → need valid word: H A M Y L? No.
- Y in 5, L in 4: _ A M L Y → need valid word: H A M L Y? No.
- Y in 5, L in 1: L A M _ Y → L A M _ Y → LAM _ Y → LAMY? No.

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-list remaining letters after exclusions:
Excluded: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, B, and now B is excluded from YAMBL feedback.
Remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J, Y, L.

Looking for actual English words:
- H A M L Y → not valid.
- F A M L Y → not valid.
- D A M L Y → not valid.
- K A M L Y → not valid.

Wait, let me try G A M L Y → GAMLY? No.
H A M L Y → HAMLY? No.

I think the only valid word fitting is H A M L Y, but it’s not recognized. Maybe I need to try K A M P Y, but P is excluded.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me try F A M U Y – U is allowed, but FAMU Y isn’t a word.

Wait, let me try H A M M Y – has double M, but M is allowed twice, and Y is in 5: HAMMY – this is a valid word!

Check constraints:
- Pattern: _ A M _ Y
- H is allowed (not excluded).
- A in 2, M in 3, Y in 5.
- No excluded letters used.

Thus, HAMMY fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

Common letters in English include: A, E, T, R, S, N, I, O, L, C, U, Y. A good starting word should use several of these.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps determine which vowels are in the word
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English words
4. It has no repeated letters, giving us maximum information

This should give us a strong foundation to narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 1.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven't tested yet.

Letters we have not used yet (common ones): T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We want a word that:
- Includes A (but not in position 1).
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TAINT"":
- A is in position 2 (not position 1), satisfying the feedback.
- Uses T, I, N which are common letters we haven't tested.
- Has no excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

Current facts:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from Guess 2: A(✓)).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N.
- So far we have: _ A _ _ _

Letters still available (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter = A
- No R, O, S, E, T, I, N
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these remaining common letters to maximize information. A good candidate is “CAMPY”:
- C, M, P, Y are all unused and common.
- Fits the pattern _ A _ _ _.

So, “CAMPY”.

From all feedback so far:

1. A is locked in position 2: _ A _ _ _
2. M is in the word and is in position 3: _ A M _ _
3. Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.
4. Letters excluded: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P.

Remaining available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A M _ _ that:
- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Has Y somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but position 2 is A, 3 is M, so Y must be in 1 or 4).

Let’s try Y in position 1: Y A M _ _
We need two more letters from the remaining pool for positions 4 and 5.

A good candidate is “YAMBL”:
- Y in 1, A in 2, M in 3, B and L are unused and common.

Check: YAMBL – valid 5-letter word, fits constraints.

Guess 4: YAMBL -> FEEDBACK: Y(-) A(✓) M(✓) B(x) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on YAMBL:
- A(✓) and M(✓) remain locked in positions 2 and 3.
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- B is NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A M _ _
Letters still allowed: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J, plus Y and L must be placed somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since 1 is now ruled out for Y, and 2,3 are fixed).

We have two unknown slots: 1 and 4 (or 5). We need a valid word fitting _ A M _ _ that uses Y and/or L in positions 4 or 5, and only the remaining letters elsewhere.

Candidate words:
- F A M Y _  → but we need a valid word, FAMYS isn’t valid.
- H A M L Y → HAMLY isn’t a word.
- G A M L Y → GAMLY isn’t a word.
- D A M P Y → P is excluded.
- V A M P Y → P excluded.
- L A M B Y → B excluded.
- Y A M _ _ → but A is fixed in 2, so invalid.
- K A M P Y → P excluded.
- U A M L Y → UAMLY isn’t a word.
- F A M B Y → B excluded.
- G A M E Y → E excluded.
- D A M L Y → DAMLY isn’t a word.

Let’s try L in position 4 and Y in position 5: _ A M L Y
We need a valid letter for position 1 from remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Valid word: H A M L Y → HAMLY (not valid)
F A M L Y → FAMLY (not valid)
G A M L Y → GAMLY (not valid)
D A M L Y → DAMLY (not valid)

Try L in position 5 and Y in position 4: _ A M Y L
Valid word: F A M Y L → FAMYL (not valid)
H A M Y L → HAMY L (not valid)
G A M Y L → GAMYL (not valid)

Wait, let’s list actual English words fitting _ A M _ _ with remaining letters:
- DAMMY (but M is already in 3, and Y is allowed in 5: DAMMY has M in 3 and 4, but 4 would be M, which is already in 3 – duplicate M, but that’s allowed. However, Y must be in the word somewhere, and DAMMY has no Y.)
- HAMMY – same issue, no Y.
- KAMAL – has L in 5 and Y in 4: K A M A L – but A is already in 2, and this has A in 4, which is allowed. But does it have Y? No.

We need Y somewhere. Let me re-examine:
The word must contain Y (from Y(✓) in guess 3), and Y cannot be in position 1 (from Y(-) in guess 4). So Y must be in position 4 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. _ A M Y _
2. _ A M _ Y

For pattern 1 (_ A M Y _):
Need a valid letter for position 1 and 5 from remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Valid word: F A M Y _ → FAMY? Not valid.
H A M Y _ → HAMY? Not valid.
D A M Y _ → DAMY? Not valid.
K A M Y _ → KAMY? Not valid.

For pattern 2 (_ A M _ Y):
Need a valid letter for position 1 and 4.
Valid word: F A M _ Y → FAM_Y → FAMY? No.
H A M _ Y → HAM_Y → HAMY? No.
D A M _ Y → DAM_Y → DAMY? No.
K A M _ Y → KAM_Y → KAMY? No.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must contain Y and L, with Y not in 1 and L not in 5. So possible placements:
- Y in 4, L in 5: _ A M Y L → need valid word: H A M Y L? No.
- Y in 5, L in 4: _ A M L Y → need valid word: H A M L Y? No.
- Y in 5, L in 1: L A M _ Y → L A M _ Y → LAM _ Y → LAMY? No.

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-list remaining letters after exclusions:
Excluded: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, B, and now B is excluded from YAMBL feedback.
Remaining: D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Z, X, Q, J, Y, L.

Looking for actual English words:
- H A M L Y → not valid.
- F A M L Y → not valid.
- D A M L Y → not valid.
- K A M L Y → not valid.

Wait, let me try G A M L Y → GAMLY? No.
H A M L Y → HAMLY? No.

I think the only valid word fitting is H A M L Y, but it’s not recognized. Maybe I need to try K A M P Y, but P is excluded.

Let me try D A M P Y again – P excluded.

Actually, let me try J A M B Y – B excluded.

F A M B Y – B excluded.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me try F A M U Y – U is allowed, but FAMU Y isn’t a word.

Wait, let me try H A M M Y – has double M, but M is allowed twice, and Y is in 5: HAMMY – this is a valid word!

Check constraints:
- Pattern: _ A M _ Y
- H is allowed (not excluded).
- A in 2, M in 3, Y in 5.
- No excluded letters used.

Thus, HAMMY fits all constraints.
