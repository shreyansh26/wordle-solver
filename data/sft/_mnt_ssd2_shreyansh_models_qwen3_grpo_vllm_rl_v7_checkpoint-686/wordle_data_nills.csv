For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are unique, maximizing the information gained from the feedback
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it to a different position.
2. Introduces entirely new letters (since A,R,O,E are out).
3. Uses common consonants and vowels that remain: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess is “UNITY”:
- S is moved to position 3 (was position 4).
- Uses new letters: U, N, I, T, Y.
- All letters are fresh; none were in the first guess.
- Covers common vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, Y).

This should give maximal new information.

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining common vowels: none left (only I is confirmed present)

We need to place S, N, I in some order among the 5 positions, and fill the remaining two slots with letters from the “safe” set above.

A good next probe should:
1. Re-use S, N, I in new positions.
2. Introduce two fresh, common, still-allowed consonants.

Candidate word: “SINUS” – but it repeats S, giving no new consonant info.  
Candidate word: “SNICK” – uses S, N, I, plus C and K (both common and safe).  
Positions of S, N, I are all changed from the previous guesses.

Therefore, SNICK is a strong third guess.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
S, N, I

So the secret word is some arrangement of S, N, I plus two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
The only letters still allowed (common ones) are:  
B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, N, I exactly once each, and two fresh letters from the safe set.  
Also, none of S, N, I can be in the same positions as before:

- S cannot be in position 4 (AROSE) or 1 (SNICK)  
- N cannot be in position 2 (UNITY) or 2 (SNICK)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (UNITY) or 3 (SNICK)

Let’s pick two new safe consonants: D and G.  
We want to place S, N, I in positions they haven’t occupied yet.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s instead look for actual English words that contain S, N, I plus two fresh consonants from the safe set.

Possible candidates:
- SINUS – repeats S, no new consonant.
- SNIPS – repeats S, no new consonant.
- SINGN – not a word.
- SNIDE – contains E (already ruled out).
- SNIBS – not a word.
- SINDH – not a word.
- SINGH – contains H (safe), but “SINGH” is a proper noun, usually not accepted.

Let’s try “SHIND” – not a word.  
“SHINS” – repeats S.  
“SHING” – not a word.  

Try “BLIND” – contains B, L, I, N, D.  
Letters: B, L, I, N, D.  
But we must include S.  

We need a word with S, N, I, plus two new consonants.  
Let’s try “SPIND” – not a word.  
“SPIN” + D – “SPIND” invalid.  

Try “SWING” – contains W and G, but no S, N, I together.  

Try “SHINS” – repeats S.  

Try “SLING” – contains S, L, I, N, G.  
This is a valid English word.  
Letters: S, L, I, N, G.  
All required letters (S, N, I) are present.  
New consonants: L, G (both safe).  
Positions:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 in AROSE and 1 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)
- L: new
- I: position 3 (was position 3 in UNITY and 3 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)
- N: position 4 (was position 2 in UNITY and 2 in SNICK – new position allowed)
- G: new

Therefore, SLING is a valid next guess that satisfies all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are unique, maximizing the information gained from the feedback
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it to a different position.
2. Introduces entirely new letters (since A,R,O,E are out).
3. Uses common consonants and vowels that remain: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess is “UNITY”:
- S is moved to position 3 (was position 4).
- Uses new letters: U, N, I, T, Y.
- All letters are fresh; none were in the first guess.
- Covers common vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, Y).

This should give maximal new information.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y  (7 letters ruled out)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
S (from AROSE) and N, I (from UNITY)

So the secret word must contain S, N, I and may not contain any of the 7 ruled-out letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining common vowels: none left (only I is confirmed present)

We need to place S, N, I in some order among the 5 positions, and fill the remaining two slots with letters from the “safe” set above.

A good next probe should:
1. Re-use S, N, I in new positions.
2. Introduce two fresh, common, still-allowed consonants.

Candidate word: “SINUS” – but it repeats S, giving no new consonant info.  
Candidate word: “SNICK” – uses S, N, I, plus C and K (both common and safe).  
Positions of S, N, I are all changed from the previous guesses.

Therefore, SNICK is a strong third guess.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
S, N, I

So the secret word is some arrangement of S, N, I plus two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
The only letters still allowed (common ones) are:  
B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, N, I exactly once each, and two fresh letters from the safe set.  
Also, none of S, N, I can be in the same positions as before:

- S cannot be in position 4 (AROSE) or 1 (SNICK)  
- N cannot be in position 2 (UNITY) or 2 (SNICK)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (UNITY) or 3 (SNICK)

Let’s pick two new safe consonants: D and G.  
We want to place S, N, I in positions they haven’t occupied yet.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5  

A quick arrangement that satisfies all constraints:

Wait, none of these are valid English words.  
Let’s instead look for actual English words that contain S, N, I plus two fresh consonants from the safe set.

Possible candidates:
- SINUS – repeats S, no new consonant.
- SNIPS – repeats S, no new consonant.
- SINGN – not a word.
- SNIDE – contains E (already ruled out).
- SNIBS – not a word.
- SINDH – not a word.
- SINGH – contains H (safe), but “SINGH” is a proper noun, usually not accepted.

Let’s try “SHIND” – not a word.  
“SHINS” – repeats S.  
“SHING” – not a word.  

Try “BLIND” – contains B, L, I, N, D.  
Letters: B, L, I, N, D.  
But we must include S.  

We need a word with S, N, I, plus two new consonants.  
Let’s try “SPIND” – not a word.  
“SPIN” + D – “SPIND” invalid.  

Try “SWING” – contains W and G, but no S, N, I together.  

Try “SHINS” – repeats S.  

Try “SLING” – contains S, L, I, N, G.  
This is a valid English word.  
Letters: S, L, I, N, G.  
All required letters (S, N, I) are present.  
New consonants: L, G (both safe).  
Positions:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 in AROSE and 1 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)
- L: new
- I: position 3 (was position 3 in UNITY and 3 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)
- N: position 4 (was position 2 in UNITY and 2 in SNICK – new position allowed)
- G: new

Therefore, SLING is a valid next guess that satisfies all constraints.

words that contain S, N, I plus two fresh consonants from the safe set.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- SINUS – repeats S, no new consonant.\n- SNIPS – repeats S, no new consonant.\n- SINGN – not a word.\n- SNIDE – contains E (already ruled out).\n- SNIBS – not a word.\n- SINDH – not a word.\n- SINGH – contains H (safe), but “SINGH” is a proper noun, usually not accepted.\n\nLet’s try “SHIND” – not a word.  \n“SHINS” – repeats S.  \n“SHING” – not a word.  \n\nTry “BLIND” – contains B, L, I, N, D.  \nLetters: B, L, I, N, D.  \nBut we must include S.  \n\nWe need a word with S, N, I, plus two new consonants.  \nLet’s try “SPIND” – not a word.  \n“SPIN” + D – “SPIND” invalid.  \n\nTry “SWING” – contains W and G, but no S, N, I together.  \n\nTry “SHINS” – repeats S.  \n\nTry “SLING” – contains S, L, I, N, G.  \nThis is a valid English word.  \nLetters: S, L, I, N, G.  \nAll required letters (S, N, I) are present.  \nNew consonants: L, G (both safe).  \nPositions:\n- S: position 1 (was position 4 in AROSE and 1 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)\n- L: new\n- I: position 3 (was position 3 in UNITY and 3 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)\n- N: position 4 (was position 2 in UNITY and 2 in SNICK – new position allowed)\n- G: new\n\nTherefore, SLING is a valid next guess that satisfies all constraints.\n\n<guess>SLING</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new

N(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)\nGuess 4: SLING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) I(-) N(-) G(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y, C, K, G

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
S, N, I, L

So the secret word is some arrangement of S, N, I, L plus one more letter that has not yet been tried.  
The only letters still allowed (common ones) are:  
B, D, F, H, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, N, I, L exactly once each, and one fresh letter from the safe set.  
Also, none of S, N, I, L can be in the same positions as before:

- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (AROSE, SNICK, SLING)  
- N cannot be in positions 2, 4 (UNITY, SNICK, SLING)  
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4 (UNITY, SNICK, SLING)  
- L cannot be in position 2 (SLING)

Let’s pick the remaining safe consonant D (it’s common and unused).  
We need to place S, N, I, L and D so that all constraints are met.

Possible positions for each letter:
- S: allowed in 3, 5  
- N: allowed in 1, 3, 5  
- I: allowed in 1, 2, 5  
- L: allowed in 1, 3, 4, 5  
- D: anywhere

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1:  
Put S in 3, N in 5, I in 1, L in 4 → I _ S L N → need a letter for position 2.  
We have only D left → I D S L N → “IDS L N” – not a word.

Option 2:  
Put S in 5, N in 1, I in 2, L in 3 → N I L _ S → need a letter for position 4.  
Only D left → N I L D S → “NILDS” – not a word.

Option 3:  
Put S in 3, N in 1, I in 2, L in 4 → N I S L _ → need a letter for position 5.  
Only D left → N I S L D → “NISL D” – not a word.

Option 4:  
Put S in 3, N in 1, I in 5, L in 4 → N _ S L I → need a letter for position 2.  
Only D left → N D S L I → “NDS L I” – not a word.

Option 5:  
Put S in 5, N in 3, I in 1, L in 4 → I _ N L S → need a letter for position 2.

None of these seem to form valid English words.

After trying all combinations with the remaining safe consonants (D, H, B, M, P, V, W, Z), none of the resulting letter arrangements form valid English words. This suggests we need to re-examine our constraints or consider that perhaps the fifth letter is a vowel we haven't used yet. However, we've already used I and the only remaining vowels are none (A, E, O, U, Y are all ruled out). 

Given this, the only possible remaining letters are the consonants we've tried plus the ones we haven't. The consonants we haven't tried yet that are safe are: F. Let's try F.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are unique, maximizing the information gained from the feedback
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it to a different position.
2. Introduces entirely new letters (since A,R,O,E are out).
3. Uses common consonants and vowels that remain: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess is “UNITY”:
- S is moved to position 3 (was position 4).
- Uses new letters: U, N, I, T, Y.
- All letters are fresh; none were in the first guess.
- Covers common vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, Y).

This should give maximal new information.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y  (7 letters ruled out)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
S (from AROSE) and N, I (from UNITY)

So the secret word must contain S, N, I and may not contain any of the 7 ruled-out letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining common vowels: none left (only I is confirmed present)

We need to place S, N, I in some order among the 5 positions, and fill the remaining two slots with letters from the “safe” set above.

A good next probe should:
1. Re-use S, N, I in new positions.
2. Introduce two fresh, common, still-allowed consonants.

Candidate word: “SINUS” – but it repeats S, giving no new consonant info.  
Candidate word: “SNICK” – uses S, N, I, plus C and K (both common and safe).  
Positions of S, N, I are all changed from the previous guesses.

Therefore, SNICK is a strong third guess.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
S, N, I

So the secret word is some arrangement of S, N, I plus two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
The only letters still allowed (common ones) are:  
B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, N, I exactly once each, and two fresh letters from the safe set.  
Also, none of S, N, I can be in the same positions as before:

- S cannot be in position 4 (AROSE) or 1 (SNICK)  
- N cannot be in position 2 (UNITY) or 2 (SNICK)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (UNITY) or 3 (SNICK)

Let’s pick two new safe consonants: D and G.  
We want to place S, N, I in positions they haven’t occupied yet.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5  

A quick arrangement that satisfies all constraints:  
S in 2, N in 1, I in 4 → _ N _ S _ I _  
We need two more letters; we’ll fill positions 3 and 5 with D and G.  
Word: D N S I G → “DN SIG” is not valid.  
Try swapping: D N I S G → “DNISG” – invalid.  
Let’s try S in 3, N in 4, I in 5 → _ _ S N I  
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2.  
Pick B and D → B D S N I → “BDSNI” – invalid.  
Pick H and D → H D S N I → “HDSNI” – invalid.  
Pick L and D → L D S N I → “LDSNI” – invalid.

Wait, none of these are valid English words.  
Let’s instead look for actual English words that contain S, N, I plus two fresh consonants from the safe set.

Possible candidates:
- SINUS – repeats S, no new consonant.
- SNIPS – repeats S, no new consonant.
- SINGN – not a word.
- SNIDE – contains E (already ruled out).
- SNIBS – not a word.
- SINDH – not a word.
- SINGH – contains H (safe), but “SINGH” is a proper noun, usually not accepted.

Let’s try “SHIND” – not a word.  
“SHINS” – repeats S.  
“SHING” – not a word.  

Try “BLIND” – contains B, L, I, N, D.  
Letters: B, L, I, N, D.  
But we must include S.  

We need a word with S, N, I, plus two new consonants.  
Let’s try “SPIND” – not a word.  
“SPIN” + D – “SPIND” invalid.  

Try “SWING” – contains W and G, but no S, N, I together.  

Try “SHINS” – repeats S.  

Try “SLING” – contains S, L, I, N, G.  
This is a valid English word.  
Letters: S, L, I, N, G.  
All required letters (S, N, I) are present.  
New consonants: L, G (both safe).  
Positions:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 in AROSE and 1 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)
- L: new
- I: position 3 (was position 3 in UNITY and 3 in SNICK – so new position is allowed)
- N: position 4 (was position 2 in UNITY and 2 in SNICK – new position allowed)
- G: new

Therefore, SLING is a valid next guess that satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, E, U, T, Y, C, K, G

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
S, N, I, L

So the secret word must be a permutation of S, N, I, L plus one more letter that hasn’t been tried yet.  
The only letters still allowed (common ones) are:  
B, D, F, H, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, N, I, L exactly once each, plus one fresh letter, and whose positions for S, N, I, L haven’t been ruled out.

Previous position bans:
- S: cannot be 1, 3, 4  
- N: cannot be 2, 3, 5  
- I: cannot be 3, 5  
- L: cannot be 2  

Let’s pick a new consonant: D is common and still allowed.

We need to place S, N, I, L, D so that all position bans are respected.

Possible positions for each:
- S: 2, 5  
- N: 1, 4  
- I: 1, 2, 4  
- L: 1, 3, 4, 5  
- D: any (no ban)
