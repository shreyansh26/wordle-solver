### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to cover as much ground as possible. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to cover as much ground as possible. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E (but neither is in its current spot).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain L, A, or T.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good candidate letters to try next are common ones like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc. Let’s build a word:
- S must be in positions 2-5.
- E must be in positions 1-4.

A word that fits: “RISEN”.
- R – new letter, common.
- I – new vowel.
- S – in position 3 (allowed, since S can’t be 1st).
- E – in position 4 (allowed, since E can’t be 5th).
- N – new letter, common.

No L, A, or T appear, and both required letters S and E are present in valid positions.

<|im_end|>

Current knowledge:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E
  – E is in the correct position (position 4)
  – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from SLATE and RISEN feedback)

So:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ E _
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3)
- We still need three more letters, none of which are L, A, T, R, I, N

Common remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Common remaining vowels: O, U

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and uses other common letters:
- Position 1: D (common, unused)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O (common vowel, unused)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: M (common consonant, unused)

Word: “DOSME” – but this isn’t valid.

Another option: “HOUSE”
- H, O, U, S, E
- S is in position 4, but E is already there – invalid.

Try “POSED”
- P, O, S, E, D
- S in position 3 – but S cannot be in position 3 (from RISEN feedback)
  
Try “GUESD” – invalid.

Valid word with S in position 2: “BOSES” – but repeats S.

Try “HUMES”
- H, U, M, E, S
- S in position 5 – allowed.
- Letters: H, U, M are unused and valid.

“HUMES” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me check:
- H: unused
- U: unused
- M: unused
- E: correct position 4
- S: allowed in position 5 (only excluded from 1 and 3)

This fits all constraints.

- S must be in positions 2-5.
- E must be in positions 1-4.

A word that fits: “RISEN”.
- R – new letter, common.
- I – new vowel.
- S – in position 3 (allowed, since S can’t be 1st).
- E – in position 4 (allowed, since E can’t be 5th).
- N – new letter, common.

No L, A, or T appear, and both required letters S and E are present in valid positions.

Current knowledge:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E
  – E is in the correct position (position 4)
  – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from SLATE and RISEN feedback)

So:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ E _
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3)
- We still need three more letters, none of which are L, A, T, R, I, N

Common remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Common remaining vowels: O, U

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and uses other common letters:
- Position 1: D (common, unused)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O (common vowel, unused)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: M (common consonant, unused)

Word: “DOSME” – but this isn’t valid.

Another option: “HOUSE”
- H, O, U, S, E
- S is in position 4, but E is already there – invalid.

Try “POSED”
- P, O, S, E, D
- S in position 3 – but S cannot be in position 3 (from RISEN feedback)
  
Try “GUESD” – invalid.

Valid word with S in position 2: “BOSES” – but repeats S.

Try “HUMES”
- H, U, M, E, S
- S in position 5 – allowed.
- Letters: H, U, M are unused and valid.

“HUMES” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me check:
- H: unused
- U: unused
- M: unused
- E: correct position 4
- S: allowed in position 5 (only excluded from 1 and 3)

This fits all constraints.

From the new feedback:

- H(x) U(x) M(x) – none of H, U, M appear in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is still locked in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is now locked in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E S

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
L, A, T, R, I, N, H, U, M

Remaining candidate letters (common ones):
B, C, D, F, G, K, O, P, V, W, Y

We need three more distinct letters for positions 1, 2, 3.

Let’s pick a valid word with:
- No forbidden letters
- Ends in “ES”
- Uses only the allowed letters

Scanning possibilities:
- DOGES – uses D, O, G, E, S → all letters allowed
- BOGES – uses B, O, G, E, S → allowed
- CODES – uses C, O, D, E, S → allowed

“DOGES” is a valid word and fits the pattern perfectly.

- Letters confirmed in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (position 5)

Remaining candidate letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden ones):
B, C, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more distinct letters for positions 1 and 3 that are:
1. Not any of the excluded letters
2. Form a valid 5-letter English word with the pattern _ O _ E S

Looking through valid words that fit this pattern:
- BOVES – uses B, O, V, E, S (all allowed)
- COVES – uses C, O, V, E, S (all allowed)
- FOYES – uses F, O, Y, E, S (all allowed)
- POVES – uses P, O, V, E, S (all allowed)

""COVES"" is a common word and uses the letters C and V which are both allowed.
