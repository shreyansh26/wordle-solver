### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is correct in position 2
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S is not in the word at all
- E is correct in position 5

So we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters to keep: A, O, R, E
- Letters to avoid: S
- A and O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since they’re not in their original spots)

Common 5-letter words matching _ R _ _ E with these constraints:
- BRAVE (but V wasn’t tested yet, and we have A and O to place)
- CRORE (but O is already confirmed, and we have A to place)
- DRIVE (but O is confirmed, and we have A to place)
- FROZE (but Z is uncommon, and we have A to place)
- GROPE (but O is confirmed, and we have A to place)

A better choice is to test possible positions for A and O while introducing a new common consonant. The word ""CRAVE"" uses C, V (new), but we already know E is fixed at the end. 

Looking at _ R _ _ E with A and O to place, a good candidate is ""CROAK"":
- C (new letter)
- R (fixed)
- O (must be placed, try position 3)
- A (must be placed, try position 4)
- K (new letter)

This tests O in position 3 and A in position 4, which were their excluded positions in AROSE.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern so far: _ R _ _ E
   - Letters in word: A, R, O, E
   - Letters not in word: S
   - A is NOT in position 1
   - O is NOT in position 3
   - A is NOT in position 4 (from CROAK feedback)

2. CROAK → C(x) R(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x)
   - R still correct in position 2
   - O is still in word but NOT in position 3
   - A is still in word but NOT in position 4
   - C and K are not in the word

So the constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters to use: A, O, R, E
- Letters to avoid: S, C, K
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- O cannot be in position 3

Possible positions for A and O:
- A can only be in position 3
- O can be in positions 1 or 4

Thus the word must be:
- If O is in position 1: O R A _ E
- If O is in position 4: _ R A O E

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- ORATE: O R A T E → T is new, but we haven't eliminated T yet
- O R A _ E: Need a consonant in position 4 that hasn't been eliminated (can't be S, C, K)
  - ORANE? Not a word
  - ORATE: O R A T E → T is allowed
- _ R A O E: Need a consonant in position 1
  - BRAVE: B R A V E → V is allowed, but we haven't tested B yet
  - GRADE: G R A D E → D is allowed
  - FRAME: F R A M E → M is allowed

ORATE seems like a strong candidate as it tests T (a very common letter) and fits all constraints.
