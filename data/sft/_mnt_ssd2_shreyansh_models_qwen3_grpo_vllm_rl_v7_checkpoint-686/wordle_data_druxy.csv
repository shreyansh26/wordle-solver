For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.

I still want a word with common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  

A balanced first attempt would be “ROUND”:
- R, N, D are common consonants.
- O, U cover two of the three remaining vowels.

Other candidates could be “CHORD”, “BRICK”, or “MOUND”, but “ROUND” feels slightly more balanced.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, O, N  
- Letters we know ARE in the word, but not yet in the right place:  
  – U (correct letter, wrong position)  
  – R (correct letter, wrong position)  
  – D (correct letter, wrong position)

So the secret word contains the letters {R, U, D} plus two more letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not in {S, L, A, T, E, O, N}).

Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y, W  
Remaining vowels: I (since O and A/E are out)

A good strategy is to place U, R, D in new positions and introduce two fresh, high-frequency consonants. Let’s try:

- Place U in position 1 (it was in position 3 last time)  
- Place R in position 2 (it was in position 1 last time)  
- Place D in position 4 (it was in position 5 last time)  
- Fill positions 3 and 5 with new consonants: C and K are both common and still allowed.

That gives “CURDK” – but wait, that’s not a valid English word.  
Let me rearrange to a real word: “CRUDY” – still not valid.  
Try “DRUID” – uses D, R, U and introduces I and D again (but D already exists).  
Try “PRUDY” – P and Y are new, valid.

So “PRUDY”:
- P (new)  
- R (known in word, new position)  
- U (known in word, new position)  
- D (known in word, new position)  
- Y (new)

This seems valid and uses only uneliminated letters.

The only unused common letters left are C, G, H, K, M, B, F, I, W, etc.

We also know:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.

I still want a word with common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  

A balanced first attempt would be “ROUND”:
- R, N, D are common consonants.
- O, U cover two of the three remaining vowels.

Other candidates could be “CHORD”, “BRICK”, or “MOUND”, but “ROUND” feels slightly more balanced.

So I’ll guess ROUND.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, O, N  
- Letters we know ARE in the word, but not yet in the right place:  
  – U (correct letter, wrong position)  
  – R (correct letter, wrong position)  
  – D (correct letter, wrong position)

So the secret word contains the letters {R, U, D} plus two more letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not in {S, L, A, T, E, O, N}).

Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y, W  
Remaining vowels: I (since O and A/E are out)

A good strategy is to place U, R, D in new positions and introduce two fresh, high-frequency consonants. Let’s try:

- Place U in position 1 (it was in position 3 last time)  
- Place R in position 2 (it was in position 1 last time)  
- Place D in position 4 (it was in position 5 last time)  
- Fill positions 3 and 5 with new consonants: C and K are both common and still allowed.

That gives “CURDK” – but wait, that’s not a valid English word.  
Let me rearrange to a real word: “CRUDY” – still not valid.  
Try “DRUID” – uses D, R, U and introduces I and D again (but D already exists).  
Try “PRUDY” – P and Y are new, valid.

So “PRUDY”:
- P (new)  
- R (known in word, new position)  
- U (known in word, new position)  
- D (known in word, new position)  
- Y (new)

This seems valid and uses only uneliminated letters.

- R(✓) at position 2 – correct letter, correct spot.
- U(✓) at position 3 – correct letter, correct spot.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- D(-) at position 5 – D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word so far is:

D R U _ _

We know the last letter must be:
- Not Y (from PRUDY feedback: Y(✓) at position 5)
- Not I (just ruled out)
- Not any of S, L, A, T, E, O, N, P (already excluded)
- Must be from remaining unused letters: C, G, H, K, M, B, F, W

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit D R U _ _:

- DRUMS – contains S (excluded)
- DRUNK – contains N (excluded)
- DRUMY – contains M and Y; Y is already known at position 5 but we just saw Y can't be at 5. Also M is allowed.
- DRURY – double R is unlikely
- DRUCK – not a common word
- DRUGS – S excluded
- DRUMS – S excluded
- DRUMY – fits pattern D R U M Y, but Y must be at position 5 which we know is invalid. So this can't be.

Wait, we know Y must be at position 5 (from PRUDY feedback: Y(✓)), but DRUID feedback says D(-) at position 5, meaning D is not at position 5. This seems contradictory? No, because in DRUID, Y was at position 5 and marked ✓, so Y must be at position 5. But in DRUID, position 5 was D, which was marked (-), meaning D is not at position 5. This is consistent because the D at position 5 in DRUID was just an example; the actual word has Y at position 5. So the word is D R U _ Y.

Now we need a letter for position 4 that:
- Is not any of S, L, A, T, E, O, N, P, I
- From remaining: C, G, H, K, M, B, F, W

Common word: D R U C Y – ""Druccy"" not valid
D R U C Y – no
D R U M Y – ""DRUMY"" is archaic but exists
D R U C Y – no
D R U B Y – ""DRUBY"" not valid
D R U C Y – no
D R U G Y – ""DRUGY"" not valid
D R U C Y – no
D R U C Y – no

The most plausible valid word is ""DRUMY"", though rare. However, checking standard word lists, ""DRUMY"" is acceptable in Scrabble but may be too obscure.

Looking again, perhaps ""DRUCK"" is not valid. Another possibility is ""DRUMY"" is the only fit. Alternatively, maybe ""DRUMY"" is acceptable.

But let's verify: D R U M Y – positions 1-5: D(✓), R(✓), U(✓), M(?), Y(✓). M hasn't been excluded.

Thus, the word must be DRUMY.

But to be safe, checking standard word lists, ""DRUMY"" is indeed accepted in many word games.

Therefore, the next guess is DRUMY.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit D R U _ _:

- DRUMS – contains S (excluded)
- DRUNK – contains N (excluded)
- DRUMY – contains M and Y; Y is already known at position 5 but we just saw Y can't be at 5. Also M is allowed.
- DRURY – double R is unlikely
- DRUCK – not a common word
- DRUGS – S excluded
- DRUMS – S excluded
- DRUMY – fits pattern D R U M Y, but Y must be at position 5 which we know is invalid. So this can't be.

Wait, we know Y must be at position 5 (from PRUDY feedback: Y(✓)), but DRUID feedback says D(-) at position 5, meaning D is not at position 5. This seems contradictory? No, because in DRUID, Y was at position 5 and marked ✓, so Y must be at position 5. But in DRUID, position 5 was D, which was marked (-), meaning D is not at position 5. This is consistent because the D at position 5 in DRUID was just an example; the actual word has Y at position 5. So the word is D R U _ Y.

Now we need a letter for position 4 that:
- Is not any of S, L, A, T, E, O, N, P, I
- From remaining: C, G, H, K, M, B, F, W

Common word: D R U C Y – ""Druccy"" not valid
D R U C Y – no
D R U M Y – ""DRUMY"" is archaic but exists
D R U C Y – no
D R U B Y – ""DRUBY"" not valid
D R U C Y – no
D R U G Y – ""DRUGY"" not valid
D R U C Y – no
D R U C Y – no

The most plausible valid word is ""DRUMY"", though rare. However, checking standard word lists, ""DRUMY"" is acceptable in Scrabble but may be too obscure.

Looking again, perhaps ""DRUCK"" is not valid. Another possibility is ""DRUMY"" is the only fit. Alternatively, maybe ""DRUMY"" is acceptable.

But let's verify: D R U M Y – positions 1-5: D(✓), R(✓), U(✓), M(?), Y(✓). M hasn't been excluded.

Thus, the word must be DRUMY.

But to be safe, checking standard word lists, ""DRUMY"" is indeed accepted in many word games.

Therefore, the next guess is DRUMY.",Guess 5: DRUMY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) U(✓) M(x) Y(✓),FAIL

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.

I still want a word with common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  

A balanced first attempt would be “ROUND”:
- R, N, D are common consonants.
- O, U cover two of the three remaining vowels.

Other candidates could be “CHORD”, “BRICK”, or “MOUND”, but “ROUND” feels slightly more balanced.

So I’ll guess ROUND.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, O, N  
- Letters we know ARE in the word, but not yet in the right place:  
  – U (correct letter, wrong position)  
  – R (correct letter, wrong position)  
  – D (correct letter, wrong position)

So the secret word contains the letters {R, U, D} plus two more letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not in {S, L, A, T, E, O, N}).

Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y, W  
Remaining vowels: I (since O and A/E are out)

A good strategy is to place U, R, D in new positions and introduce two fresh, high-frequency consonants. Let’s try:

- Place U in position 1 (it was in position 3 last time)  
- Place R in position 2 (it was in position 1 last time)  
- Place D in position 4 (it was in position 5 last time)  
- Fill positions 3 and 5 with new consonants: C and K are both common and still allowed.

That gives “CURDK” – but wait, that’s not a valid English word.  
Let me rearrange to a real word: “CRUDY” – still not valid.  
Try “DRUID” – uses D, R, U and introduces I and D again (but D already exists).  
Try “PRUDY” – P and Y are new, valid.

So “PRUDY”:
- P (new)  
- R (known in word, new position)  
- U (known in word, new position)  
- D (known in word, new position)  
- Y (new)

This seems valid and uses only uneliminated letters.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, P  
Letters known TO be in the word (positions still unknown): D, U, R, Y  

So the secret word is made up of the four letters {D, R, U, Y} plus one more letter that has not yet been tried.  
The only unused common letters left are C, G, H, K, M, B, F, I, W, etc.

We also know:
- R is in the word and is NOT in position 2 (from PRUDY feedback: R(✓) means it’s correct, so position 2 must be R).
- U is in the word and is NOT in position 3 (from PRUDY: U(✓) means it’s correct, so position 3 must be U).
- D is in the word and is NOT in position 4 (from PRUDY: D(-) means it’s correct but in wrong position, so position 4 is NOT D).
- Y is in the word and is NOT in position 5 (from PRUDY: Y(✓) means it’s correct, so position 5 must be Y).

So far we have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: U
- Position 5: Y

Letters still needed: D (must be in position 1 or 4), plus one more letter (must be from remaining unused letters).

Possible patterns:
- D _ U _ Y
- _ R U _ Y (but position 2 is already R, so this is invalid)
Wait, positions are fixed:
1: ?
2: R
3: U
4: ?
5: Y

So the word must be: [letter] R U [letter] Y

We know D must be in position 1 or 4, but position 4 is still unknown. However, from PRUDY feedback, D is in the word but not in position 4, so D must be in position 1.

Thus the word is: D R U _ Y

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that fits D R U _ Y. The only common English word is ""DRUID"".

Let's check:
- D: position 1 (matches requirement: not excluded)
- R: position 2 (matches requirement)
- U: position 3 (matches requirement)
- I: new letter, not yet tried
- Y: position 5 (matches requirement)

""DRUID"" uses all known letters (D, R, U, Y) and introduces I, which hasn't been eliminated.

However, the most plausible and accepted word in common usage that matches the pattern is **DRUCK** (though rare). Given the constraints, **DRUCK** is the only remaining valid form in standard word lists.

Therefore, the final guess is DRUCK.",Guess 6: DRUCK -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) U(✓) C(x) K(x),FAIL
