### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but none of them are in their current positions).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A, R, E but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid O and S entirely.
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good untested common letters: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, Y.

Let’s try a word that repositions A, R, E and adds new letters.  
""TARED"" uses:
- T (new, common)
- A (must be present, now in position 2)
- R (must be present, now in position 3)
- E (must be present, now in position 4)
- D (new, common)

This satisfies all constraints and tests new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - O and S are not in the word.

2. TARED → T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(✓)
   - A is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is now in the correct position (position 4).
   - D is in the correct position (position 5).
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ E D
- Letters to include: A, E, D (already placed), R (must appear somewhere else).
- Letters to exclude: O, S, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2, E in position 4, D in position 5.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since R cannot be in position 3 from TARED feedback, it must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is still possible? Wait, TARED had R in position 3 with feedback R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So R must be in position 1.
- So the word must be R A _ E D.

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that fits R A _ E D. The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet excluded. From previous exclusions: O, S, T are out. Common remaining letters: N, I, L, C, etc.

RA N ED → RANED (valid word: past tense of ""rane"" - though rare)
RA I E D → RA IED (valid word: archaic past tense of ""rave"", but uncommon)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but none of them are in their current positions).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A, R, E but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid O and S entirely.
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good untested common letters: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, Y.

Let’s try a word that repositions A, R, E and adds new letters.  
""TARED"" uses:
- T (new, common)
- A (must be present, now in position 2)
- R (must be present, now in position 3)
- E (must be present, now in position 4)
- D (new, common)

This satisfies all constraints and tests new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TARED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - O and S are not in the word.

2. TARED → T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(✓)
   - A is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is now in the correct position (position 4).
   - D is in the correct position (position 5).
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ E D
- Letters to include: A, E, D (already placed), R (must appear somewhere else).
- Letters to exclude: O, S, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2, E in position 4, D in position 5.
- Contains R somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since R cannot be in position 3 from TARED feedback, it must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is still possible? Wait, TARED had R in position 3 with feedback R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So R must be in position 1.
- So the word must be R A _ E D.

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that fits R A _ E D. The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet excluded. From previous exclusions: O, S, T are out. Common remaining letters: N, I, L, C, etc.

RA N ED → RANED (valid word: past tense of ""rane"" - though rare)
RA I E D → RA IED (valid word: archaic past tense of ""rave"", but uncommon)
RA L E D → R A L E D (valid word: past tense of ""rale"")

""RANED"" is the most straightforward valid word fitting the pattern.

Current known pattern: R A _ E D

Current state:
- Pattern: R A _ E D
- Position 3 is the only unknown.
- Letters already confirmed in the word: R, A, E, D
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, T, N, C

Remaining possible letters for position 3 (must be a single consonant, not any of the excluded letters):
From the alphabet, excluding R, A, E, D, O, S, T, N, C, the remaining consonants are:
B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit R A _ E D with these letters:
- R A B E D
- R A F E D
- R A G E D
- R A H E D
- R A K E D
- R A L E D
- R A M E D
- R A P E D
- R A U E D
- R A Y E D

Among these, ""RABED"" is a valid word (archaic past tense of ""rave"" or ""rabi""), but it's uncommon. ""RACED"" was just tried and failed. ""RALED"" is also uncommon. ""RAME D"" is not a word. ""RAPED"" is valid (past tense of rape). ""RABED"" is the only other common one left.

Since ""RAPED"" fits the pattern and all letters are allowed, it's the logical next guess.
