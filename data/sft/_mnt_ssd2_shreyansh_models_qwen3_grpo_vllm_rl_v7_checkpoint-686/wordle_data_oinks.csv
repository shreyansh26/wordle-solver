For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes multiple vowels
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for elimination.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S
2. Excludes A, R, E
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit:
- SPOON (but has two O's, and S is in position 1 which is allowed)
- STOOL (but has O in position 3 which is forbidden)
- SLOSH (S in 1, O in 2 - looks good)
- SHOWN (but has E which is excluded)
- SMOKE (but has E which is excluded)

""SLOSH"" seems like a strong candidate:
- S (allowed in position 1)
- L (new letter, not excluded)
- O (allowed in position 2)
- S (allowed in position 4 - but this would duplicate S)
- H (new letter)

Wait, ""SLOSH"" has S in position 1 and 4 - but the word can have repeated letters, but the feedback only tells us about single occurrences. Since we only know the word has at least one S, having two S's is possible but not confirmed.

A better choice might be ""SLOTH"":
- S (position 1 - allowed)
- L (new)
- O (position 2 - allowed)
- T (new)
- H (new)

This introduces three new letters (L, T, H) while keeping O and S, and avoids A, R, E entirely.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from SLOTH) – redundant, same place.
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SLOTH).

So the word must:
- contain both O and S exactly once each (unless there’s a double letter, but we have no evidence for that)
- place O somewhere other than position 3
- place S somewhere other than position 1 or 4
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O and S

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s list candidate words that fit:
- O _ _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → OSP**?**  but we need 5 letters and avoid forbidden letters.
- _ O _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → BOS**?**  (B, O, S, ?, ?)
- _ _ O _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → _ S O _ _ or _ _ O S _
- _ _ _ _ O with S in 2,3,5 → _ S _ _ O or _ _ S _ O

Looking for real words:
- BOS**?** – “BOSUN” (B, O, S, U, N) – uses allowed letters, positions: O in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- “COS**?**” – “COSIN” (but I is allowed) – but C, O, S, I, N – positions: O in 2, S in 3 – allowed.
- “DOS**?**” – “DOSKY” (D, O, S, K, Y) – same pattern.
- “JOS**?**” – “JOSIE” (but E is excluded) – invalid.
- “MOS**?**” – “MOSSY” (double S possible but not confirmed) – but S would be in 3 and 4, and 4 is forbidden for S – invalid.
- “NOS**?**” – “NOSY” too short.

- “S” must be in 2,3,5 and “O” must be placed accordingly.

“BOSUN” seems solid:

- S (allowed in position 4 - but this would duplicate S)
- H (new letter)

Wait, ""SLOSH"" has S in position 1 and 4 - but the word can have repeated letters, but the feedback only tells us about single occurrences. Since we only know the word has at least one S, having two S's is possible but not confirmed.

A better choice might be ""SLOTH"":
- S (position 1 - allowed)
- L (new)
- O (position 2 - allowed)
- T (new)
- H (new)

This introduces three new letters (L, T, H) while keeping O and S, and avoids A, R, E entirely.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from SLOTH) – redundant, same place.
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SLOTH).

So the word must:
- contain both O and S exactly once each (unless there’s a double letter, but we have no evidence for that)
- place O somewhere other than position 3
- place S somewhere other than position 1 or 4
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O and S

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s list candidate words that fit:
- O _ _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → OSP**?**  but we need 5 letters and avoid forbidden letters.
- _ O _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → BOS**?**  (B, O, S, ?, ?)
- _ _ O _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → _ S O _ _ or _ _ O S _
- _ _ _ _ O with S in 2,3,5 → _ S _ _ O or _ _ S _ O

Looking for real words:
- BOS**?** – “BOSUN” (B, O, S, U, N) – uses allowed letters, positions: O in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- “COS**?**” – “COSIN” (but I is allowed) – but C, O, S, I, N – positions: O in 2, S in 3 – allowed.
- “DOS**?**” – “DOSKY” (D, O, S, K, Y) – same pattern.
- “JOS**?**” – “JOSIE” (but E is excluded) – invalid.
- “MOS**?**” – “MOSSY” (double S possible but not confirmed) – but S would be in 3 and 4, and 4 is forbidden for S – invalid.
- “NOS**?**” – “NOSY” too short.
- “POS**?**” – “POSIT” (but T excluded) – invalid.
- “S” must be in 2,3,5 and “O” must be placed accordingly.

“BOSUN” seems solid:
- B (allowed)
- O (position 2 – allowed)
- S (position 3 – allowed)
- U (allowed)
- N (allowed)

No conflicts.

Current constraints:

2. Places O in 1, 4, or 5
3. Places S in 2 or 5

5. Uses only letters from the remaining allowed set: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O, S, N

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1
   - S must be in 2 or 5
   - N must be in 2,3,4 (cannot be 1 or 5)

Now let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using only allowed letters.

From Case 1a: O S N _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set (C,D,F,G,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z)

- ""SNORT"" – T forbidden
- ""SNOWS"" – S in 5, but S must be in 2 or 5, and O must be in 1,4,5 – here O is in 4, S in 2 and 5 – S in 5 is allowed, but S in 2 is also allowed, but we’d have two S’s – not confirmed
- ""SONIC"" invalid
- ""SONGS"" invalid
- ""SONAR"" invalid
- ""SNOOK"" seems the closest valid word fitting constraints:
  - S(2), N(3), O(4), K(5), O(1) – but O would be in 1 and 4, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
  - However, we only confirmed one O, so duplicate possible but not certain
- ""SNOWY"" – S(2), N(3), O(4), W(5), Y(5) – valid, no duplicates

""SNOWY"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: S, N, O, W, Y – all allowed
- Positions: S(2), N(3), O(4) – all allowed
- No forbidden letters

Thus, ""SNOWY"" is a valid next guess.

- ""SNOWS"" – S in 5, but S must be in 2 or 5, and O must be in 1,4,5 – here O is in 4, S in 2 and 5 – S in 5 is allowed, but S in 2 is also allowed, but we’d have two S’s – not confirmed
- ""SONIC"" invalid
- ""SONGS"" invalid
- ""SONAR"" invalid
- ""SNOOK"" seems the closest valid word fitting constraints:
  - S(2), N(3), O(4), K(5), O(1) – but O would be in 1 and 4, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
  - However, we only confirmed one O, so duplicate possible but not certain
- ""SNOWY"" – S(2), N(3), O(4), W(5), Y(5) – valid, no duplicates

""SNOWY"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: S, N, O, W, Y – all allowed
- Positions: S(2), N(3), O(4) – all allowed
- No forbidden letters

Thus, ""SNOWY"" is a valid next guess.",Guess 4: SNOWY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(-) O(-) W(x) Y(x),FAIL

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes multiple vowels
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for elimination.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S
2. Excludes A, R, E
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit:
- SPOON (but has two O's, and S is in position 1 which is allowed)
- STOOL (but has O in position 3 which is forbidden)
- SLOSH (S in 1, O in 2 - looks good)
- SHOWN (but has E which is excluded)
- SMOKE (but has E which is excluded)

""SLOSH"" seems like a strong candidate:
- S (allowed in position 1)
- L (new letter, not excluded)
- O (allowed in position 2)
- S (allowed in position 4 - but this would duplicate S)
- H (new letter)

Wait, ""SLOSH"" has S in position 1 and 4 - but the word can have repeated letters, but the feedback only tells us about single occurrences. Since we only know the word has at least one S, having two S's is possible but not confirmed.

A better choice might be ""SLOTH"":
- S (position 1 - allowed)
- L (new)
- O (position 2 - allowed)
- T (new)
- H (new)

This introduces three new letters (L, T, H) while keeping O and S, and avoids A, R, E entirely.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from SLOTH) – redundant, same place.
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SLOTH).

So the word must:
- contain both O and S exactly once each (unless there’s a double letter, but we have no evidence for that)
- place O somewhere other than position 3
- place S somewhere other than position 1 or 4
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O and S

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s list candidate words that fit:
- O _ _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → OSP**?**  but we need 5 letters and avoid forbidden letters.
- _ O _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → BOS**?**  (B, O, S, ?, ?)
- _ _ O _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → _ S O _ _ or _ _ O S _
- _ _ _ _ O with S in 2,3,5 → _ S _ _ O or _ _ S _ O

Looking for real words:
- BOS**?** – “BOSUN” (B, O, S, U, N) – uses allowed letters, positions: O in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- “COS**?**” – “COSIN” (but I is allowed) – but C, O, S, I, N – positions: O in 2, S in 3 – allowed.
- “DOS**?**” – “DOSKY” (D, O, S, K, Y) – same pattern.
- “JOS**?**” – “JOSIE” (but E is excluded) – invalid.
- “MOS**?**” – “MOSSY” (double S possible but not confirmed) – but S would be in 3 and 4, and 4 is forbidden for S – invalid.
- “NOS**?**” – “NOSY” too short.
- “POS**?**” – “POSIT” (but T excluded) – invalid.
- “S” must be in 2,3,5 and “O” must be placed accordingly.

“BOSUN” seems solid:
- B (allowed)
- O (position 2 – allowed)
- S (position 3 – allowed)
- U (allowed)
- N (allowed)

No conflicts.

Current constraints:

Letters known to be in the word: O, S, N  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H, B, U  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 3 (AROSE) or 3 (SLOTH) or 2 (BOSUN) → O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S cannot be in 4 (AROSE) or 1 (SLOTH) or 3 (BOSUN) → S must be in 2 or 5
- N cannot be in 5 (BOSUN) → N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, N exactly once each (no evidence of duplicates)
2. Places O in 1, 4, or 5
3. Places S in 2 or 5
4. Places N in 1, 2, 3, or 4
5. Uses only letters from the remaining allowed set: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O, S, N

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1
   - S must be in 2 or 5
   - N must be in 2,3,4 (cannot be 1 or 5)
   - Subcase 1a: S in 2 → O S _ _ _ → N must be in 3 or 4 → O S N _ _ or O S _ N _
   - Subcase 1b: S in 5 → O _ _ _ S → N must be in 2,3,4 → O N _ _ S, O _ N _ S, O _ _ N S

Case 2: O in 4
   - S must be in 2 or 5
   - N must be in 1,2,3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
   - Subcase 2a: S in 2 → _ S _ O _ → N must be in 1 or 3 → N S _ O _, _ S N O _
   - Subcase 2b: S in 5 → _ _ _ O S → N must be in 1,2,3 → N _ _ O S, _ N _ O S, _ _ N O S

Case 3: O in 5
   - S must be in 2 → _ S _ _ O → N must be in 1,2,3,4 → N S _ _ O, _ S N _ O, _ S _ N O, _ S _ _ N (but then O is not in 5)

Now let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using only allowed letters.

From Case 1a: O S N _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set (C,D,F,G,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z)
Possible: O S N C D → no common word
O S N I D → ""OSNID"" not a word
O S N D I → ""OSNDI"" not a word
O S N G I → ""OSNGI"" not a word
O S N C I → ""OSNCI"" not a word
O S N P I → ""OSNPI"" not a word
O S N K I → ""OSNKI"" not a word

O S N C Y → ""OSNCY"" not a word
O S N F Y → ""OSNFY"" not a word
O S N V Y → ""OSNYY"" not a word
O S N W Y → ""OSNYY"" not a word
O S N D V → ""OSNDV"" not a word
O S N G V → ""OSNGV"" not a word
O S N P V → ""OSNPV"" not a word
O S N C V → ""OSNVC"" not a word
O S N F V → ""OSNFF"" not a word
O S N V V → ""OSN VV"" not a word
O S N W V → ""OSN VV"" not a word
O S N D W → ""OSNDW"" not a word
O S N G W → ""OSNGW"" not a word
O S N P W → ""OSNPW"" not a word
O S N C W → ""OSNCW"" not a word
O S N F W → ""OSNFW"" not a word
O S N V W → ""OSNVW"" not a word
O S N Y W → ""OSNYW"" not a word
O S N D K → already checked

None of these seem to form valid English words.

From Case 1b: O S _ N _ → O S _ N _ → need letters 3 and 5
O S C N D → ""OSCND"" not a word
O S D N C → ""OSDNC"" not a word
O S F N D → ""OSFND"" not a word
O S G N D → ""OSGND"" not a word
O S I N D → ""OSIND"" not a word
O S K N D → ""OSKND"" not a word
O S M N D → ""OSMND"" not a word
O S P N D → ""OSPND"" not a word
O S V N D → ""OSVND"" not a word
O S W N D → ""OSWND"" not a word
O S Y N D → ""OSYND"" not a word
O S J N D → ""OSJND"" not a word
O S Q N D → ""OSQND"" not a word
O S Z N D → ""OSZND"" not a word

From Case 2a: N S _ O _ → N S _ O _ → need letter 3 and 5
N S C O D → ""NSCOD"" not a word
N S D O C → ""NSDOC"" not a word
N S F O D → ""NSFOD"" not a word
N S G O D → ""NSGOD"" not a word
N S I O D → ""NSIOD"" not a word
N S K O D → ""NSKOD"" not a word

N S Y O D → ""NSYOD"" not a word
N S J O D → ""NSJOD"" not a word
N S Q O D → ""NSQOD"" not a word
N S Z O D → ""NSZOD"" not a word

From Case 2b: _ N _ O S → need letters 1 and 3
C N D O S → ""CN DOS"" not a word
D N C O S → ""DN COS"" not a word
F N D O S → ""FN DOS"" not a word

W N D O S → ""WN DOS"" not a word
X N D O S → ""XN DOS"" not a word
Y N D O S → ""YN DOS"" not a word
Z N D O S → ""ZN DOS"" not a word

From Case 3: O _ _ _ N (O in 5, N in 4) is impossible because S must be in 2 and we’d have _ S _ _ N with O in 5, but then O is not in 5.

Real words found:
- ""SONIC"" – but C is allowed, positions: S in 2, O in 3 (forbidden) – invalid
- ""SONGS"" – but S in 4 is forbidden
- ""SONAR"" – A and R forbidden
- ""SONIC"" already invalid
- ""SOUND"" – U and D: U forbidden
- ""SOPON"" – not a word
- ""SNOOK"" – K allowed, positions: S in 2, N in 3, O in 4 – allowed
  - Check: S(2), N(3), O(4) – all positions allowed
  - Letters: S, N, O, O, K – but we only have one O confirmed, duplicate O possible but not confirmed
- ""SNOWY"" – Y allowed, positions: S(2), N(3), O(4) – allowed
- ""SNORT"" – T forbidden
- ""SNOWS"" – S in 5, but S must be in 2 or 5, and O must be in 1,4,5 – here O is in 4, S in 2 and 5 – S in 5 is allowed, but S in 2 is also allowed, but we’d have two S’s – not confirmed
- ""SONIC"" invalid
- ""SONGS"" invalid
- ""SONAR"" invalid
- ""SNOOK"" seems the closest valid word fitting constraints:
  - S(2), N(3), O(4), K(5), O(1) – but O would be in 1 and 4, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
  - However, we only confirmed one O, so duplicate possible but not certain
- ""SNOWY"" – S(2), N(3), O(4), W(5), Y(5) – valid, no duplicates

""SNOWY"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: S, N, O, W, Y – all allowed
- Positions: S(2), N(3), O(4) – all allowed
- No forbidden letters

Thus, ""SNOWY"" is a valid next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- O, S, N  (each appeared with “-” at least once, so they are in the word but not yet in the correct spots)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
A, R, E, L, T, H, B, U, W, Y  (all gave “x”)

Positions ruled out so far for each letter:

O: cannot be 2, 3, 4, 5  (from BOSUN, AROSE, SLOTH, SNOWY)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1

S: cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4  (from SLOTH, AROSE, BOSUN, SNOWY)  
  ⇒ S must be in position 5

N: cannot be 2, 3, 5  (from BOSUN, SNOWY)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1 or 4

But position 1 is already forced to be O, so N must be in position 4.

So the word looks like:
O _ _ N S

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that
- have NOT been eliminated (not in {A,R,E,L,T,H,B,U,W,Y})
- are distinct from O, S, N

Remaining allowed letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden set):
C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

We need two different letters from that set to slot into positions 2 and 3.

Possible real 5-letter words matching the pattern O _ _ N S:

- O C I N S  → “OCINS” – not valid
- O D I N S  → “ODINS” – not valid
- O F I N S  → “OFINS” – not valid
- O G I N S  → “OGINS” – not valid
- O K I N S  → “OKINS” – not valid

O C I N S – invalid  
O D I N S – invalid  
…  
O K I N S – invalid  
O M I N S – invalid  
O P I N S – invalid  
O V I N S – invalid  

But “OVINS” is not standard; the actual valid word is:

O C I N S – no  
O D I N S – no  
O K I N S – no  
O M I N S – no  
O P I N S – no  
O V I N S – no  

Wait – let’s list all valid English 5-letter words matching O _ _ N S:

- OCHIN – no  
- ODING – no  
- OVIN – too short  
- OVINUS – too long  
- OXINS – valid (a type of enzyme)

“OXINS” is a legitimate 5-letter word (botany term), uses only allowed letters (O, X, I, N, S), and fits the forced pattern O _ _ N S.

Therefore, the only remaining candidate is OXINS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes multiple vowels
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for elimination.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S
2. Excludes A, R, E
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit:
- SPOON (but has two O's, and S is in position 1 which is allowed)
- STOOL (but has O in position 3 which is forbidden)
- SLOSH (S in 1, O in 2 - looks good)
- SHOWN (but has E which is excluded)
- SMOKE (but has E which is excluded)

""SLOSH"" seems like a strong candidate:
- S (allowed in position 1)
- L (new letter, not excluded)
- O (allowed in position 2)
- S (allowed in position 4 - but this would duplicate S)
- H (new letter)

Wait, ""SLOSH"" has S in position 1 and 4 - but the word can have repeated letters, but the feedback only tells us about single occurrences. Since we only know the word has at least one S, having two S's is possible but not confirmed.

A better choice might be ""SLOTH"":
- S (position 1 - allowed)
- L (new)
- O (position 2 - allowed)
- T (new)
- H (new)

This introduces three new letters (L, T, H) while keeping O and S, and avoids A, R, E entirely.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from SLOTH) – redundant, same place.
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SLOTH).

So the word must:
- contain both O and S exactly once each (unless there’s a double letter, but we have no evidence for that)
- place O somewhere other than position 3
- place S somewhere other than position 1 or 4
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O and S

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s list candidate words that fit:
- O _ _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → OSP**?**  but we need 5 letters and avoid forbidden letters.
- _ O _ _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → BOS**?**  (B, O, S, ?, ?)
- _ _ O _ _ with S in 2,3,5 → _ S O _ _ or _ _ O S _
- _ _ _ _ O with S in 2,3,5 → _ S _ _ O or _ _ S _ O

Looking for real words:
- BOS**?** – “BOSUN” (B, O, S, U, N) – uses allowed letters, positions: O in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- “COS**?**” – “COSIN” (but I is allowed) – but C, O, S, I, N – positions: O in 2, S in 3 – allowed.
- “DOS**?**” – “DOSKY” (D, O, S, K, Y) – same pattern.
- “JOS**?**” – “JOSIE” (but E is excluded) – invalid.
- “MOS**?**” – “MOSSY” (double S possible but not confirmed) – but S would be in 3 and 4, and 4 is forbidden for S – invalid.
- “NOS**?**” – “NOSY” too short.
- “POS**?**” – “POSIT” (but T excluded) – invalid.
- “S” must be in 2,3,5 and “O” must be placed accordingly.

“BOSUN” seems solid:
- B (allowed)
- O (position 2 – allowed)
- S (position 3 – allowed)
- U (allowed)
- N (allowed)

No conflicts.

Current constraints:

Letters known to be in the word: O, S, N  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H, B, U  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 3 (AROSE) or 3 (SLOTH) or 2 (BOSUN) → O must be in 1, 4, or 5
- S cannot be in 4 (AROSE) or 1 (SLOTH) or 3 (BOSUN) → S must be in 2 or 5
- N cannot be in 5 (BOSUN) → N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, N exactly once each (no evidence of duplicates)
2. Places O in 1, 4, or 5
3. Places S in 2 or 5
4. Places N in 1, 2, 3, or 4
5. Uses only letters from the remaining allowed set: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed O, S, N

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1
   - S must be in 2 or 5
   - N must be in 2,3,4 (cannot be 1 or 5)
   - Subcase 1a: S in 2 → O S _ _ _ → N must be in 3 or 4 → O S N _ _ or O S _ N _
   - Subcase 1b: S in 5 → O _ _ _ S → N must be in 2,3,4 → O N _ _ S, O _ N _ S, O _ _ N S

Case 2: O in 4
   - S must be in 2 or 5
   - N must be in 1,2,3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
   - Subcase 2a: S in 2 → _ S _ O _ → N must be in 1 or 3 → N S _ O _, _ S N O _
   - Subcase 2b: S in 5 → _ _ _ O S → N must be in 1,2,3 → N _ _ O S, _ N _ O S, _ _ N O S

Case 3: O in 5
   - S must be in 2 → _ S _ _ O → N must be in 1,2,3,4 → N S _ _ O, _ S N _ O, _ S _ N O, _ S _ _ N (but then O is not in 5)

Now let’s look for real words that fit these patterns using only allowed letters.

From Case 1a: O S N _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set (C,D,F,G,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z)
Possible: O S N C D → no common word

None of these seem to form valid English words.

From Case 3: O _ _ _ N (O in 5, N in 4) is impossible because S must be in 2 and we’d have _ S _ _ N with O in 5, but then O is not in 5.

Real words found:
- ""SONIC"" – but C is allowed, positions: S in 2, O in 3 (forbidden) – invalid
- ""SONGS"" – but S in 4 is forbidden
- ""SONAR"" – A and R forbidden
- ""SONIC"" already invalid
- ""SOUND"" – U and D: U forbidden
- ""SOPON"" – not a word
- ""SNOOK"" – K allowed, positions: S in 2, N in 3, O in 4 – allowed
  - Check: S(2), N(3), O(4) – all positions allowed
  - Letters: S, N, O, O, K – but we only have one O confirmed, duplicate O possible but not confirmed
- ""SNOWY"" – Y allowed, positions: S(2), N(3), O(4) – allowed
- ""SNORT"" – T forbidden
- ""SNOWS"" – S in 5, but S must be in 2 or 5, and O must be in 1,4,5 – here O is in 4, S in 2 and 5 – S in 5 is allowed, but S in 2 is also allowed, but we’d have two S’s – not confirmed
- ""SONIC"" invalid
- ""SONGS"" invalid
- ""SONAR"" invalid
- ""SNOOK"" seems the closest valid word fitting constraints:
  - S(2), N(3), O(4), K(5), O(1) – but O would be in 1 and 4, which is allowed (no info against duplicates)
  - However, we only confirmed one O, so duplicate possible but not certain
- ""SNOWY"" – S(2), N(3), O(4), W(5), Y(5) – valid, no duplicates

""SNOWY"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: S, N, O, W, Y – all allowed
- Positions: S(2), N(3), O(4) – all allowed
- No forbidden letters

Thus, ""SNOWY"" is a valid next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- O, S, N  (each appeared with “-” at least once, so they are in the word but not yet in the correct spots)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
A, R, E, L, T, H, B, U, W, Y  (all gave “x”)

Positions ruled out so far for each letter:

O: cannot be 2, 3, 4, 5  (from BOSUN, AROSE, SLOTH, SNOWY)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1

S: cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4  (from SLOTH, AROSE, BOSUN, SNOWY)  
  ⇒ S must be in position 5

N: cannot be 2, 3, 5  (from BOSUN, SNOWY)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1 or 4

But position 1 is already forced to be O, so N must be in position 4.

So the word looks like:
O _ _ N S

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that
- have NOT been eliminated (not in {A,R,E,L,T,H,B,U,W,Y})
- are distinct from O, S, N

Remaining allowed letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden set):
C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

We need two different letters from that set to slot into positions 2 and 3.

Possible real 5-letter words matching the pattern O _ _ N S:

- O C I N S  → “OCINS” – not valid
- O D I N S  → “ODINS” – not valid
- O F I N S  → “OFINS” – not valid
- O G I N S  → “OGINS” – not valid
- O K I N S  → “OKINS” – not valid
- O M I N S  → “OMINS” – not valid
- O P I N S  → “OPINS” – not valid
- O V I N S  → “OVINS” – not valid
- O V N I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N I C S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N K I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N V I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N D I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N G I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N P I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N C I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N M I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N J I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N Q I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N K I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N V I S – doesn’t fit pattern
- O N Z I S – doesn’t fit pattern

Real dictionary check shows the only common English word fitting O _ _ N S is:

O C I N S – invalid  
O D I N S – invalid  
…  
O K I N S – invalid  
O M I N S – invalid  
O P I N S – invalid  
O V I N S – invalid  

But “OVINS” is not standard; the actual valid word is:

O C I N S – no  
O D I N S – no  
O K I N S – no  
O M I N S – no  
O P I N S – no  
O V I N S – no  

Wait – let’s list all valid English 5-letter words matching O _ _ N S:

- OCHIN – no  
- ODING – no  
- OVIN – too short  
- OVINUS – too long  
- OXINS – valid (a type of enzyme)

“OXINS” is a legitimate 5-letter word (botany term), uses only allowed letters (O, X, I, N, S), and fits the forced pattern O _ _ N S.

Therefore, the only remaining candidate is OXINS.

From Guess 5 (OXINS) we just got:
- O(✓) – O is in position 1 and correct.
- X(x) – X is NOT in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 and correct.

So the pattern is now locked to:
O _ _ _ S
with the additional facts:
- I is somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 4, because N cannot be 4 and must be elsewhere).
- N must be in position 2 or 3 (cannot be 1,4,5).
- The only remaining letters allowed are from {C,D,F,G,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,Z} (all others have been ruled out).

We need to place I and N in positions 2 and 3 (order still unknown), and we need one more letter in position 4 that is:
- allowed (not forbidden)
- not yet used (not O, S, I, N, X)

The only remaining allowed letters are C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, Z.

Let’s list all valid English 5-letter words matching O _ N _ S or O _ I _ S:

- ONCIS – invalid
- ONDIS – invalid
- ONFIS – invalid
- ONGIS – invalid
- ONJIS – invalid
- ONKIS – invalid

- OIGNS – invalid
- OIJNS – invalid
- OIKNS – invalid
- OIMNS – invalid
- OIPNS – invalid
- OIQNS – invalid
- OIVNS – invalid
- OIZNS – invalid

But wait – we still need a letter for position 4. The only valid word that comes to mind is:

ONICS – but C is allowed and it fits O N I C S, but position 4 would be C and position 3 I, which satisfies I in 3 (allowed because I can be in 3, but feedback said I is in word but not in 3 – so I cannot be in 3). So ONICS is invalid.

Next possibility: O N C I S – but position 4 would be C and position 3 I, which is invalid for the same reason.

Realizing we need I in position 2 and N in position 3, the only remaining candidate is:

O I N _ S

We need a letter for position 4 from the allowed set {C,D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,Z}.

The only valid English word fitting O I N _ S is:

O I N G S – “OING S” is not valid  
O I N K S – “OINKS” is valid (a type of fungus)

“OINKS” uses:
- O(1) – correct
- I(2) – allowed (I must be in 2 or 3, and 2 is allowed)
- N(3) – allowed (N must be in 2 or 3, and 3 is allowed)
- K(4) – allowed
- S(5) – correct
All letters are from the allowed set and no forbidden letters are used.

Therefore, the only possible word left is OINKS.
