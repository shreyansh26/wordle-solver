For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good coverage for elimination. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""AUDIO"", but ""SLATE"" is widely considered one of the best starting words for Wordle-like games. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it also covers several high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- Does contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and S.
- Does not use R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

Good next candidates would be words like:
- STAIN (but uses I and N, and S is in position 1 which is allowed since we only know S is not in position 4)
- STASH (but uses H and T, and S is in position 1)
- SALAD (but uses L and D, and A is in position 1 which we know is wrong)
- SAILS (but uses I and L, and A is in position 2 which is allowed)

""SALAD"" is invalid because A is in position 1, which we know is wrong.
""STAIN"" is valid: S is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), and it doesn't use R, O, or E.
""SAILS"" is also valid: S is in position 1, A is in position 2, and it doesn't use R, O, or E.

Between these, ""STAIN"" seems like a good choice to test new letters (T, I, N) while respecting the constraints.

- SPAIL (P is allowed, L is allowed)

""SHAIL"" seems valid: S, H, A, I, L - none of the forbidden letters, and all positions match the constraints.

Another check: ""SKAIL"" - S, K, A, I, L - also valid.

Between these, ""SHAIL"" is a valid word (though less common), while ""SKAIL"" is a valid variant. ""SHAIL"" is more commonly recognized.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SHAIL"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good coverage for elimination. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""AUDIO"", but ""SLATE"" is widely considered one of the best starting words for Wordle-like games.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- Does contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and S.
- Does not use R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

Good next candidates would be words like:
- STAIN (but uses I and N, and S is in position 1 which is allowed since we only know S is not in position 4)
- STASH (but uses H and T, and S is in position 1)
- SALAD (but uses L and D, and A is in position 1 which we know is wrong)
- SAILS (but uses I and L, and A is in position 2 which is allowed)

""SALAD"" is invalid because A is in position 1, which we know is wrong.
""STAIN"" is valid: S is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), and it doesn't use R, O, or E.
""SAILS"" is also valid: S is in position 1, A is in position 2, and it doesn't use R, O, or E.

Between these, ""STAIN"" seems like a good choice to test new letters (T, I, N) while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).
   - T and N are not in the word.
   - A is in the correct position (position 3).
   - I is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- The word is S _ A I _ (positions 1, 3, 4 fixed).
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The missing letters are positions 2 and 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 3.
- Has I in position 4.
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, N.
- Uses valid letters for positions 2 and 5.

Possible patterns: S _ A I _

Looking at common words fitting this pattern:
- SCARF (but F is allowed, but R is not)
- SPAIN (but N is not allowed)
- SLAIN (but N is not allowed)
- SWAIN (but N is not allowed)
- SHAIL (but L is allowed, H is allowed)
- SKAIL (K is allowed, L is allowed)
- SPAIL (P is allowed, L is allowed)

""SHAIL"" seems valid: S, H, A, I, L - none of the forbidden letters, and all positions match the constraints.

Another check: ""SKAIL"" - S, K, A, I, L - also valid.

Between these, ""SHAIL"" is a valid word (though less common), while ""SKAIL"" is a valid variant. ""SHAIL"" is more commonly recognized.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SHAIL"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good coverage for elimination. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""AUDIO"", but ""SLATE"" is widely considered one of the best starting words for Wordle-like games. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it also covers several high-frequency letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- Does contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and S.
- Does not use R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

Good next candidates would be words like:
- STAIN (but uses I and N, and S is in position 1 which is allowed since we only know S is not in position 4)
- STASH (but uses H and T, and S is in position 1)
- SALAD (but uses L and D, and A is in position 1 which we know is wrong)
- SAILS (but uses I and L, and A is in position 2 which is allowed)

""SALAD"" is invalid because A is in position 1, which we know is wrong.
""STAIN"" is valid: S is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), and it doesn't use R, O, or E.
""SAILS"" is also valid: S is in position 1, A is in position 2, and it doesn't use R, O, or E.

Between these, ""STAIN"" seems like a good choice to test new letters (T, I, N) while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).
   - T and N are not in the word.
   - A is in the correct position (position 3).
   - I is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- The word is S _ A I _ (positions 1, 3, 4 fixed).
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The missing letters are positions 2 and 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Has A in position 3.
- Has I in position 4.
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, N.
- Uses valid letters for positions 2 and 5.

Possible patterns: S _ A I _

Looking at common words fitting this pattern:
- SCARF (but F is allowed, but R is not)
- SPAIN (but N is not allowed)
- SLAIN (but N is not allowed)
- SWAIN (but N is not allowed)
- SHAIL (but L is allowed, H is allowed)
- SKAIL (K is allowed, L is allowed)
- SPAIL (P is allowed, L is allowed)

""SHAIL"" seems valid: S, H, A, I, L - none of the forbidden letters, and all positions match the constraints.

Another check: ""SKAIL"" - S, K, A, I, L - also valid.

Between these, ""SHAIL"" is a valid word (though less common), while ""SKAIL"" is a valid variant. ""SHAIL"" is more commonly recognized.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SHAIL"".

We now have:

- S ✓ _ _ _ _ (position 1 fixed)
- A ✓ _ _ _ (position 3 fixed)

- L ✓ _ _ _ (position 5 fixed)

So the pattern is: S _ A I L

Only position 2 remains unknown.

Letters already ruled out (from all feedback):
R, O, E, T, N, H

Letters still allowed (not yet tested or ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit S _ A I L:
- SCAIL? (not a word)
- SPAIL? (not a word)
- SKAIL? (valid variant, but less common)
- SWAIL? (valid, but rare)
- SLAIL? (valid, but ""slail"" is uncommon)
- SKAIL is actually a Scottish term for a narrow strip, but may not be in standard dictionaries.

The most common word fitting S _ A I L is ""SKAIL"" (as listed in some dictionaries), but if that's too obscure, the next best is to test ""SPAIL"" or ""SLAIL"". However, ""SLAIL"" is a valid word (though rare), and ""SPAIL"" is not recognized.

Given that, ""SKAIL"" is the most plausible next guess. But since we have only one position left, and we need to pick a valid word, ""SKAIL"" is the only common variant. However, looking again, ""SWAIL"" is also listed.

But let's check standard dictionaries: the recognized word is ""SKAIL"" (Scots). However, in standard English, the word ""SKAIL"" is not common. 

Wait, actually, the correct recognized word fitting S _ A I L is ""SKAIL"" (as per some word lists), but let me verify. 

Upon reflection, the correct and most common word is ""SKAIL"". Therefore, we should test it.

But since we have only position 2 left, and we need to choose a valid letter, the only common word is ""SKAIL"". 

Thus, the next guess is ""SKAIL"".The pattern is now S _ A I L, and the only common word fitting this is ""SKAIL"".

We already know L must appear somewhere else (because the second L got “-”), but position 5 is already L, so the other L must be in position 2.  
Hence the only possible word is S L A I L.",Guess 6: SLAIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) I(✓) L(✓),FAIL
