For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words cover common letters and can provide useful feedback.

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- DOES contain O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good letters to include next are common ones like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we know O and S are present, let's try to form a word with these plus other common consonants.

Possible candidates: 
- STONE (but has E, which is excluded)
- SPOON (but has O in position 3, which is excluded)
- STOIC (has C and I, but O is in position 3, which is excluded)
- SLOTH (has H and T, O is in position 3, which is excluded)
- SONIC (O in position 3, excluded)
- TISON (but has T and I, O is in position 3, excluded)

Let's try ""STOIC"" but since O is in position 3, that's invalid. ""SLOTH"" has O in position 3, invalid. ""SPOON"" has O in position 3, invalid. 

Alternative: ""STOKE"" - but has E and O in position 3. 

Wait, let's think differently. We need O not in position 3 and S not in position 4. 

Let's try ""SOLIT"" - but has I and T, O is in position 2 (valid), S is in position 1 (valid). No A, R, E. This seems good.

Another option: ""SOLID"" - O in position 2, S in position 1, no A/R/E. 

""SOLID"" seems like a strong choice - common word, includes O and S in new positions, adds L, I, D which are common letters.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after two guesses.

From AROSE (A x, R x, O -, S -, E x):
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E
- Letters in the word but wrong place: O, S

From SOLID (S -, O -, L x, I -, D x):
- Letters not in the word: L, D (in addition to A, R, E)
- Letters in the word but wrong place: S, O, I

Therefore the secret word must contain exactly the letters {O, S, I} plus two more letters that have not been ruled out.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 1
- I cannot be in position 4

Common remaining consonants that have not been tried: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the allowed letters {O, S, I} plus two from the remaining pool.
2. Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
4. Places I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to construct such a word. A good candidate is “POSIT”:
- Contains P (new letter), O, S, I, T (new letter)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 (but this is ruled out by SOLID feedback, since I was marked “-” in position 4 in SOLID)

Oops, that’s invalid. Let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, ruled out)
  
Next try “ISON” + a consonant: “ISON” is only 4 letters. Let’s think systematically.

Try “SOTIN” (anagram of STOIN):
- S in position 1 (invalid)
  
Try “TISON” (but T is new, I in position 3, S in position 2, O in position 4):
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- T and N are new letters
This forms the word “TISON” which is a valid English word (though rare). 

A more common word: “STOIC” had O in position 3 (invalid). “STOIN” is not a word.

Try “SONIC” – O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SNOIT” – O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “POSIT” again – I in position 4 (invalid).

Try “PATIO” – A is ruled out.

Try “CISTO” – not a word.

Try “TONIC” – O in position 2 (allowed), S not present (we need S).

We must include S, O, I. Let’s try “S” in position 2, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ S _ O _” with I in 3 → “_ S I O _”. Fill with new letters: “C S I O N” → “CSION” is not a word. “B S I O N” → “BSION” is not a word. “P S I O N” → “PSION” is not common.

But “MINOS” is valid and fits:
- Letters: M, I, N, O, S – all allowed

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words cover common letters and can provide useful feedback.

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- DOES contain O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good letters to include next are common ones like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we know O and S are present, let's try to form a word with these plus other common consonants.

Possible candidates: 
- STONE (but has E, which is excluded)
- SPOON (but has O in position 3, which is excluded)
- STOIC (has C and I, but O is in position 3, which is excluded)
- SLOTH (has H and T, O is in position 3, which is excluded)
- SONIC (O in position 3, excluded)
- TISON (but has T and I, O is in position 3, excluded)

Let's try ""STOIC"" but since O is in position 3, that's invalid. ""SLOTH"" has O in position 3, invalid. ""SPOON"" has O in position 3, invalid. 

Alternative: ""STOKE"" - but has E and O in position 3. 

Wait, let's think differently. We need O not in position 3 and S not in position 4. 

Let's try ""SOLIT"" - but has I and T, O is in position 2 (valid), S is in position 1 (valid). No A, R, E. This seems good.

Another option: ""SOLID"" - O in position 2, S in position 1, no A/R/E. 

""SOLID"" seems like a strong choice - common word, includes O and S in new positions, adds L, I, D which are common letters.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after two guesses.

From AROSE (A x, R x, O -, S -, E x):
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E
- Letters in the word but wrong place: O, S

From SOLID (S -, O -, L x, I -, D x):
- Letters not in the word: L, D (in addition to A, R, E)
- Letters in the word but wrong place: S, O, I

Therefore the secret word must contain exactly the letters {O, S, I} plus two more letters that have not been ruled out.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 1
- I cannot be in position 4

Common remaining consonants that have not been tried: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the allowed letters {O, S, I} plus two from the remaining pool.
2. Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
4. Places I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to construct such a word. A good candidate is “POSIT”:
- Contains P (new letter), O, S, I, T (new letter)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 (but this is ruled out by SOLID feedback, since I was marked “-” in position 4 in SOLID)

Oops, that’s invalid. Let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, ruled out)
  
Next try “ISON” + a consonant: “ISON” is only 4 letters. Let’s think systematically.

Try “SOTIN” (anagram of STOIN):
- S in position 1 (invalid)
  
Try “TISON” (but T is new, I in position 3, S in position 2, O in position 4):
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- T and N are new letters
This forms the word “TISON” which is a valid English word (though rare). 

A more common word: “STOIC” had O in position 3 (invalid). “STOIN” is not a word.

Try “SONIC” – O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SNOIT” – O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “POSIT” again – I in position 4 (invalid).

Try “PATIO” – A is ruled out.

Try “CISTO” – not a word.

Try “TONIC” – O in position 2 (allowed), S not present (we need S).

We must include S, O, I. Let’s try “S” in position 2, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ S _ O _” with I in 3 → “_ S I O _”. Fill with new letters: “C S I O N” → “CSION” is not a word. “B S I O N” → “BSION” is not a word. “P S I O N” → “PSION” is not common.

Try “S” in position 5, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ _ I O S”. Fill with new letters: “C I N O S” → “CINOS” is not a word. “P I N O S” → “PINOS” is not a word. “M I N O S” → “MINOS” is valid (ancient king).

But “MINOS” is valid and fits:
- Letters: M, I, N, O, S – all allowed
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- M and N are new letters not ruled out

- Letters in the word and fixed positions: I (position 2), N (position 3), S (position 5)
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: O (must be in position 1 or 4, since 2,3,5 are taken by I,N,S)
- Remaining letters to fill: positions 1 and 4, must include O in one of them

Possible structure: [O or ?] I N [O or ?] S
But O must be in either position 1 or 4.

But let's verify:
- ""TINOS"" has T (position 1), I (2), N (3), O (4), S (5)
- T is not ruled out
- This fits all constraints: I,N,S in correct positions, O in new position (4), no disallowed letters

Based on the feedback, we now know:

- O must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5 and 2,3,5 are taken)

Therefore the secret word must contain exactly the letters {O, S, I} plus two more letters that have not been ruled out.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 1
- I cannot be in position 4

Common remaining consonants that have not been tried: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

2. Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
4. Places I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to construct such a word. A good candidate is “POSIT”:
- Contains P (new letter), O, S, I, T (new letter)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 (but this is ruled out by SOLID feedback, since I was marked “-” in position 4 in SOLID)

- S in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)

- T and N are new letters
This forms the word “TISON” which is a valid English word (though rare).

We must include S, O, I. Let’s try “S” in position 2, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ S _ O _” with I in 3 → “_ S I O _”. Fill with new letters: “C S I O N” → “CSION” is not a word. “B S I O N” → “BSION” is not a word. “P S I O N” → “PSION” is not common.

Try “S” in position 5, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ _ I O S”. Fill with new letters: “C I N O S” → “CINOS” is not a word. “P I N O S” → “PINOS” is not a word. “M I N O S” → “MINOS” is valid (ancient king).

But “MINOS” is valid and fits:
- Letters: M, I, N, O, S – all allowed
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- M and N are new letters not ruled out

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: MINOS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(✓) O(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on MINOS:
- M is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is I
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is N
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O is not in position 4
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is S

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, D, M
- Letters in the word and fixed positions: I (position 2), N (position 3), S (position 5)
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: O (must be in position 1 or 4, since 2,3,5 are taken by I,N,S)
- Remaining letters to fill: positions 1 and 4, must include O in one of them

Possible structure: [O or ?] I N [O or ?] S
But O must be in either position 1 or 4.

Case 1: O in position 1 → O I N _ S → need a letter for position 4 that is not yet ruled out (not A,R,E,L,D,M)
Case 2: O in position 4 → _ I N O S → need a letter for position 1 that is not yet ruled out

Let's consider Case 2 first: _ I N O S
Possible letters for position 1 (not A,R,E,L,D,M): common remaining letters include B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for common 5-letter words ending in ""INOS"":
- ""FINOS"" - but F is allowed
- ""PINOS"" - P is allowed
- ""GINOS"" - G is allowed
- ""HINOS"" - H is allowed
- ""TINOS"" - T is allowed

""FINOS"" is a valid word (plural of finocchio, a type of squash)
But let's check if any of these are more likely. ""TINOS"" is also valid.

Alternatively, Case 1: O I N _ S
Need a letter for position 4, not A,R,E,L,D,M
Possible: O I N K S → ""OINKS"" - but O is position 1, which is allowed
But ""OINKS"" is a valid word.

Between these, ""TINOS"" seems more straightforward as a common word.

But let's verify:
- ""TINOS"" has T (position 1), I (2), N (3), O (4), S (5)
- T is not ruled out
- This fits all constraints: I,N,S in correct positions, O in new position (4), no disallowed lettersBased on the feedback, we now know:
- The word is _ I N O S (positions 2,3,5 are fixed as I, N, S)
- O must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5 and 2,3,5 are taken)
- Position 1 must be a new letter not yet used (not A,R,E,L,D,M)

A valid word fitting this is ""TINOS"".

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words cover common letters and can provide useful feedback.

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- DOES contain O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good letters to include next are common ones like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we know O and S are present, let's try to form a word with these plus other common consonants.

Possible candidates: 
- STONE (but has E, which is excluded)
- SPOON (but has O in position 3, which is excluded)
- STOIC (has C and I, but O is in position 3, which is excluded)
- SLOTH (has H and T, O is in position 3, which is excluded)
- SONIC (O in position 3, excluded)
- TISON (but has T and I, O is in position 3, excluded)

Let's try ""STOIC"" but since O is in position 3, that's invalid. ""SLOTH"" has O in position 3, invalid. ""SPOON"" has O in position 3, invalid. 

Alternative: ""STOKE"" - but has E and O in position 3. 

Wait, let's think differently. We need O not in position 3 and S not in position 4. 

Let's try ""SOLIT"" - but has I and T, O is in position 2 (valid), S is in position 1 (valid). No A, R, E. This seems good.

Another option: ""SOLID"" - O in position 2, S in position 1, no A/R/E. 

""SOLID"" seems like a strong choice - common word, includes O and S in new positions, adds L, I, D which are common letters.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after two guesses.

From AROSE (A x, R x, O -, S -, E x):
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E
- Letters in the word but wrong place: O, S

From SOLID (S -, O -, L x, I -, D x):
- Letters not in the word: L, D (in addition to A, R, E)
- Letters in the word but wrong place: S, O, I

Therefore the secret word must contain exactly the letters {O, S, I} plus two more letters that have not been ruled out.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 1
- I cannot be in position 4

Common remaining consonants that have not been tried: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the allowed letters {O, S, I} plus two from the remaining pool.
2. Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
4. Places I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to construct such a word. A good candidate is “POSIT”:
- Contains P (new letter), O, S, I, T (new letter)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 (but this is ruled out by SOLID feedback, since I was marked “-” in position 4 in SOLID)

Oops, that’s invalid. Let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, ruled out)
  
Next try “ISON” + a consonant: “ISON” is only 4 letters. Let’s think systematically.

Try “SOTIN” (anagram of STOIN):
- S in position 1 (invalid)
  
Try “TISON” (but T is new, I in position 3, S in position 2, O in position 4):
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- T and N are new letters
This forms the word “TISON” which is a valid English word (though rare). 

A more common word: “STOIC” had O in position 3 (invalid). “STOIN” is not a word.

Try “SONIC” – O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SNOIT” – O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “POSIT” again – I in position 4 (invalid).

Try “PATIO” – A is ruled out.

Try “CISTO” – not a word.

Try “TONIC” – O in position 2 (allowed), S not present (we need S).

We must include S, O, I. Let’s try “S” in position 2, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ S _ O _” with I in 3 → “_ S I O _”. Fill with new letters: “C S I O N” → “CSION” is not a word. “B S I O N” → “BSION” is not a word. “P S I O N” → “PSION” is not common.

Try “S” in position 5, “O” in position 4, “I” in position 3: “_ _ I O S”. Fill with new letters: “C I N O S” → “CINOS” is not a word. “P I N O S” → “PINOS” is not a word. “M I N O S” → “MINOS” is valid (ancient king).

But “MINOS” is valid and fits:
- Letters: M, I, N, O, S – all allowed
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- M and N are new letters not ruled out

- Letters in the word and fixed positions: I (position 2), N (position 3), S (position 5)
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: O (must be in position 1 or 4, since 2,3,5 are taken by I,N,S)
- Remaining letters to fill: positions 1 and 4, must include O in one of them

Possible structure: [O or ?] I N [O or ?] S
But O must be in either position 1 or 4.

Case 1: O in position 1 → O I N _ S → need a letter for position 4 that is not yet ruled out (not A,R,E,L,D,M)
Case 2: O in position 4 → _ I N O S → need a letter for position 1 that is not yet ruled out

Let's consider Case 2 first: _ I N O S

- ""FINOS"" - but F is allowed
- ""PINOS"" - P is allowed
- ""GINOS"" - G is allowed
- ""HINOS"" - H is allowed
- ""TINOS"" - T is allowed

""FINOS"" is a valid word (plural of finocchio, a type of squash)
But let's check if any of these are more likely. ""TINOS"" is also valid.

Alternatively, Case 1: O I N _ S
Need a letter for position 4, not A,R,E,L,D,M
Possible: O I N K S → ""OINKS"" - but O is position 1, which is allowed
But ""OINKS"" is a valid word.

Between these, ""TINOS"" seems more straightforward as a common word.

But let's verify:
- ""TINOS"" has T (position 1), I (2), N (3), O (4), S (5)
- T is not ruled out
- This fits all constraints: I,N,S in correct positions, O in new position (4), no disallowed lettersBased on the feedback, we now know:
- The word is _ I N O S (positions 2,3,5 are fixed as I, N, S)
- O must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5 and 2,3,5 are taken)
- Position 1 must be a new letter not yet used (not A,R,E,L,D,M)

A valid word fitting this is ""TINOS"".

Current constraints (after four guesses):

1. Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, D, M, T
2. Fixed letters and positions:
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: N
   - Position 5: S
3. O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (every position has been tried once and received “-”).  
   This is impossible: a 5-letter word must contain O, yet every legal position for O has been ruled out.  
   Therefore the only remaining possibility is that the word contains **two** O’s, with one of them in a position already marked “-” because the duplicate letter was not yet explicitly ruled out.

Hence the word must be _ I N O S with an **additional O** in one of the first three positions (since position 4 and 5 are already excluded for O).  
The only way to fit two O’s is to have the first letter be O, giving:

O I N O S  →  “OINOS”

This is a valid English word (plural of oinos, the ancient wine skin) and satisfies every constraint.
