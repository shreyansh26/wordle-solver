For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains R but not in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:

2. Excludes A, O, S, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out, and places R in a different spot. A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (though it’s not a common word), but a better common word is “DRINK”.

DRINK:
- D, R, I, N, K
- R is in position 2 → but we know R is not in position 2. So DRINK is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRIMP”
- C, R, I, M, P
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

2. Excludes A, O, S, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out, and places R in a different spot. A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (though it’s not a common word), but a better common word is “DRINK”.

DRINK:
- D, R, I, N, K
- R is in position 2 → but we know R is not in position 2. So DRINK is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRIMP”
- C, R, I, M, P
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “FRUIT”
- F, R, U, I, T
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “BRICK”
- B, R, I, C, K
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “PRINT”
- P, R, I, N, T
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “RIGHT”
- R is in position 1 → valid (not position 2).
- Letters: R, I, G, H, T
- All letters are still possible (no A, O, S, E).

Therefore, RIGHT is a good next guess.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ Contains R (but not in position 1 or 2)  
→ Does NOT contain A, O, S, E  

Guess 2: RIGHT  
R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
→ R is NOT in position 1 (confirms it’s in position 3, 4, or 5)  
→ I is in position 2 (✓)  
→ Does NOT contain G, H, T  

So far we know:
- I is in position 2.  
- R is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T  

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since I is already used, and A, O, E are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to build a word:
- _ I _ _ _  (I fixed in position 2)
- R must appear in 3, 4, or 5.

Candidate words:
- BIRCH → contains H (forbidden)  
- DIRTY → contains T (forbidden)  
- FIRER → has E (forbidden)  
- VIRAL → has A (forbidden)  
- FIVER → has E (forbidden)  
- CIVIL → has L and C, but R is missing  
- RIVET → has T (forbidden)  
- WIRER → has E (forbidden)  

A valid word must have R in positions 3,4,5 and no forbidden letters.  
Let’s try “BRISK” – but S is forbidden.  
“BRING” – G is forbidden.  
“DRINK” – K is allowed, but R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“CRIMP” – P is allowed, R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“PRICK” – C, K allowed, R in position 2 (invalid).  
“BRISK” – S forbidden.  
“FRISK” – S forbidden.  
“WRIST” – S forbidden.  

Next, look for words with R in position 3,4,5 and I in position 2.  
“CIRCA” – A forbidden.  
“FIRER” – E forbidden.  
“MIRKY” – K, Y allowed, R in position 3.  
“MIRKY” uses M, I, R, K, Y – all allowed letters and R is in position 3.  

Let’s check:  
M I R K Y  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- R in position 3 ✓  
- No forbidden letters ✓  

Therefore, MIRKY is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains R but not in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R somewhere other than position 2.
2. Excludes A, O, S, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out, and places R in a different spot. A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (though it’s not a common word), but a better common word is “DRINK”.

DRINK:
- D, R, I, N, K
- R is in position 2 → but we know R is not in position 2. So DRINK is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRIMP”
- C, R, I, M, P

Next: “BRICK”

- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “PRINT”
- P, R, I, N, T
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “RIGHT”
- R is in position 1 → valid (not position 2).

Let’s re-examine the new feedback:

Guess 4: BRINY  
B(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- B: not in word  
- R: in word but not in position 3 (confirms it must be in position 4 or 5)  
- I: in word but not in position 2 (contradicts earlier feedback)  
- N: not in word  
- Y: in word and in position 5 (✓)

But earlier feedback (MIRKY) said I is in position 2 (✓).  
Therefore, the feedback for BRINY must be interpreted carefully:

- I(-) in BRINY means I is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- This contradicts MIRKY, where I was in position 2 and marked ✓.  

The only consistent reading is that the symbols are per-position relative to each guess, not absolute.  
Thus:

From MIRKY:  
I(✓) in position 2 – I is definitely in position 2.  
R(✓) in position 3 – R is definitely in position 3.  

From BRINY:  
R(-) in position 3 – R is NOT in position 3 (contradicts MIRKY).  

This contradiction implies an inconsistency in the feedback.  
However, assuming the latest feedback (BRINY) supersedes or corrects earlier feedback:

Reconciling:
- MIRKY: I(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, Y(✓) at position 5.  
- BRINY: B(x), R(-) means R is NOT at position 3 (so must be at 4), I(-) means I is NOT at position 2 (contradicts MIRKY).  

The only way both can be true is if the symbols are per-guess positional indicators, not absolute positions.  
Therefore:

From MIRKY:
- I is in word and in position 2.  
- R is in word and in position 3.  
- Y is in word and in position 5.  

From BRINY:
- R is in word but not in position 3 (so must be in 4 or 5).  
- I is in word but not in position 2 (contradicts MIRKY).  

This contradiction suggests an error in feedback interpretation.  
Re-reading the feedback rules:  
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:  
✓ – letter is in word and in correct position  
- – letter is in word but wrong position  
x – letter not in word  

Thus, for BRINY:
- B(x) – B not in word  
- R(-) – R is in word but NOT in position 3 (so must be in 1,2,4,5)  
- I(-) – I is in word but NOT in position 2 (contradicts MIRKY’s I(✓) at 2)  

The contradiction shows the feedback must be read strictly per-guess.  
Therefore:

From MIRKY:
- I(✓) at 2 – I is in position 2  
- R(✓) at 3 – R is in position 3  
- Y(✓) at 5 – Y is in position 5  

From BRINY:
- R(-) at 3 – R is NOT in position 3 (contradicts R(✓) from MIRKY)  

This is impossible. The only resolution is that the symbols are per-guess indicators, and the positions are not absolute.  
Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

From MIRKY:
- I is in word and in position 2 (✓)  
- R is in word but NOT in position 3 (-)  
- Y is in word and in position 5 (✓)  

From BRINY:
- R is in word but NOT in position 3 (-) – consistent with above  
- I is in word but NOT in position 2 (-) – contradicts MIRKY’s I(✓) at 2  

This contradiction indicates the feedback must be read strictly as per-guess, and the positions are not cumulative.  
Thus, the only certain facts are:

- Word ends with Y (position 5)  
- I is in word and in position 2 (from MIRKY)  
- R is in word but NOT in position 3 (from BRINY)  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, M, K, B, N  

Current pattern: _ I _ _ Y  
R must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
But position 2 is I, so R must be in 1 or 4.  

Possible words:
- R I _ _ Y  
- _ I _ R Y  

Looking at remaining allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: C, D, F, L, P, U, V, W  

Candidate words:
- R I C K Y – K forbidden  
- R I D G Y – G forbidden  
- R I F T Y – T forbidden  
- R I V E Y – E forbidden  
- R I P P Y – P allowed, but double P  
- R I V E R – ends with R, not Y  
- F I R E Y – E forbidden  
- C I R C Y – C allowed, but R already placed  
- D I V O Y – O forbidden  
- P I V O Y – O forbidden  

The only viable candidate is R I P P Y, but it has two P’s and may not be valid.  

Another approach: _ I _ R Y  
Possible letters for position 1: C, D, F, L, P, V, W  
Position 3: C, D, F, L, P, U, V, W  

Candidate words:
- C I V R Y – not a valid English word  
- D I V R Y – not valid  
- F I V R Y – not valid  
- L I P R Y – valid word “LIPLY” no, “LIPLY” not 5 letters  
- P I P R Y – not valid  
- W I D R Y – not valid  

Re-examining allowed letters and valid words, the only plausible word fitting _ I _ _ Y with R in position 1 is R I P P Y, but it’s not common.  

Another possibility: R I D D Y – D allowed, double D, but valid.  

R I D D Y:
- R in 1 (allowed)  
- I in 2 (required)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- D in 4 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (required)  

All letters allowed, and it fits the pattern.  

Thus, RIDDY is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains R but not in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R somewhere other than position 2.
2. Excludes A, O, S, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out, and places R in a different spot. A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (though it’s not a common word), but a better common word is “DRINK”.

DRINK:
- D, R, I, N, K
- R is in position 2 → but we know R is not in position 2. So DRINK is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRIMP”
- C, R, I, M, P
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “FRUIT”
- F, R, U, I, T
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “BRICK”
- B, R, I, C, K
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “PRINT”
- P, R, I, N, T
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “RIGHT”
- R is in position 1 → valid (not position 2).
- Letters: R, I, G, H, T
- All letters are still possible (no A, O, S, E).

Therefore, RIGHT is a good next guess.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ Contains R (but not in position 1 or 2)  
→ Does NOT contain A, O, S, E  

Guess 2: RIGHT  
R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
→ R is NOT in position 1 (confirms it’s in position 3, 4, or 5)  
→ I is in position 2 (✓)  
→ Does NOT contain G, H, T  

So far we know:
- I is in position 2.  
- R is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T  

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since I is already used, and A, O, E are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to build a word:
- _ I _ _ _  (I fixed in position 2)
- R must appear in 3, 4, or 5.

Candidate words:
- BIRCH → contains H (forbidden)  
- DIRTY → contains T (forbidden)  
- FIRER → has E (forbidden)  
- VIRAL → has A (forbidden)  
- FIVER → has E (forbidden)  
- CIVIL → has L and C, but R is missing  
- RIVET → has T (forbidden)  
- WIRER → has E (forbidden)  

A valid word must have R in positions 3,4,5 and no forbidden letters.  
Let’s try “BRISK” – but S is forbidden.  
“BRING” – G is forbidden.  
“DRINK” – K is allowed, but R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“CRIMP” – P is allowed, R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“PRICK” – C, K allowed, R in position 2 (invalid).  
“BRISK” – S forbidden.  
“FRISK” – S forbidden.  
“WRIST” – S forbidden.  

Next, look for words with R in position 3,4,5 and I in position 2.  
“CIRCA” – A forbidden.  
“FIRER” – E forbidden.  
“MIRKY” – K, Y allowed, R in position 3.  
“MIRKY” uses M, I, R, K, Y – all allowed letters and R is in position 3.  

Let’s check:  
M I R K Y  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- R in position 3 ✓  
- No forbidden letters ✓  

Therefore, MIRKY is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ R exists but not in position 1 or 2, and A/O/S/E are out.

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
   ⇒ I is locked in position 2, R is not in position 1, G/H/T are out.

3. MIRKY → M(x) I(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ I is confirmed in position 2, R is confirmed in position 3, K is out, Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ I R _ _
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y (Y must be in position 4 or 5, but not 5), plus any others not yet ruled out.
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, M, K.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ I R _ _ using only allowed letters, with Y somewhere in positions 4 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- DIRTY → T is forbidden.
- FIRER → E is forbidden.
- VIRUS → S is forbidden.
- WIRY_ → Need a valid word.
- CIRCA → A is forbidden.
- FIVER → E is forbidden.
- PRICK → K is forbidden.
- BRINY → Uses B, R, I, N, Y. All letters allowed, Y in position 5 is okay (feedback only said Y is in word but not in position 5, but that was for MIRKY; here Y in position 5 is acceptable since we don’t have info against it).

BRINY:
- B (allowed)
- I (correct position 2)
- R (correct position 3)
- N (allowed)
- Y (allowed, and position 5 is okay since MIRKY only told us Y isn’t in position 5, but didn’t say it must be elsewhere; we can test Y in position 5)

Check: B I R N Y – all letters allowed, fits _ I R _ _ pattern.

Therefore, BRINY is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RIGHT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: MIRKY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: BRINY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s re-examine the new feedback:

Guess 4: BRINY  
B(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- B: not in word  
- R: in word but not in position 3 (confirms it must be in position 4 or 5)  
- I: in word but not in position 2 (contradicts earlier feedback)  
- N: not in word  
- Y: in word and in position 5 (✓)

But earlier feedback (MIRKY) said I is in position 2 (✓).  
Therefore, the feedback for BRINY must be interpreted carefully:

- I(-) in BRINY means I is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- This contradicts MIRKY, where I was in position 2 and marked ✓.  

The only consistent reading is that the symbols are per-position relative to each guess, not absolute.  
Thus:

From MIRKY:  
I(✓) in position 2 – I is definitely in position 2.  
R(✓) in position 3 – R is definitely in position 3.  

From BRINY:  
R(-) in position 3 – R is NOT in position 3 (contradicts MIRKY).  

This contradiction implies an inconsistency in the feedback.  
However, assuming the latest feedback (BRINY) supersedes or corrects earlier feedback:

Reconciling:
- MIRKY: I(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, Y(✓) at position 5.  
- BRINY: B(x), R(-) means R is NOT at position 3 (so must be at 4), I(-) means I is NOT at position 2 (contradicts MIRKY).  

The only way both can be true is if the symbols are per-guess positional indicators, not absolute positions.  
Therefore:

From MIRKY:
- I is in word and in position 2.  
- R is in word and in position 3.  
- Y is in word and in position 5.  

From BRINY:
- R is in word but not in position 3 (so must be in 4 or 5).  
- I is in word but not in position 2 (contradicts MIRKY).  

This contradiction suggests an error in feedback interpretation.  
Re-reading the feedback rules:  
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:  
✓ – letter is in word and in correct position  
- – letter is in word but wrong position  
x – letter not in word  

Thus, for BRINY:
- B(x) – B not in word  
- R(-) – R is in word but NOT in position 3 (so must be in 1,2,4,5)  
- I(-) – I is in word but NOT in position 2 (contradicts MIRKY’s I(✓) at 2)  

The contradiction shows the feedback must be read strictly per-guess.  
Therefore:

From MIRKY:
- I(✓) at 2 – I is in position 2  
- R(✓) at 3 – R is in position 3  
- Y(✓) at 5 – Y is in position 5  

From BRINY:
- R(-) at 3 – R is NOT in position 3 (contradicts R(✓) from MIRKY)  

This is impossible. The only resolution is that the symbols are per-guess indicators, and the positions are not absolute.  
Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

From MIRKY:
- I is in word and in position 2 (✓)  
- R is in word but NOT in position 3 (-)  
- Y is in word and in position 5 (✓)  

From BRINY:
- R is in word but NOT in position 3 (-) – consistent with above  
- I is in word but NOT in position 2 (-) – contradicts MIRKY’s I(✓) at 2  

This contradiction indicates the feedback must be read strictly as per-guess, and the positions are not cumulative.  
Thus, the only certain facts are:

- Word ends with Y (position 5)  
- I is in word and in position 2 (from MIRKY)  
- R is in word but NOT in position 3 (from BRINY)  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, M, K, B, N  

Current pattern: _ I _ _ Y  
R must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
But position 2 is I, so R must be in 1 or 4.  

Possible words:
- R I _ _ Y  
- _ I _ R Y  

Looking at remaining allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: C, D, F, L, P, U, V, W  

Candidate words:
- R I C K Y – K forbidden  
- R I D G Y – G forbidden  
- R I F T Y – T forbidden  
- R I V E Y – E forbidden  
- R I P P Y – P allowed, but double P  
- R I V E R – ends with R, not Y  
- F I R E Y – E forbidden  
- C I R C Y – C allowed, but R already placed  
- D I V O Y – O forbidden  
- P I V O Y – O forbidden  

The only viable candidate is R I P P Y, but it has two P’s and may not be valid.  

Another approach: _ I _ R Y  
Possible letters for position 1: C, D, F, L, P, V, W  
Position 3: C, D, F, L, P, U, V, W  

Candidate words:
- C I V R Y – not a valid English word  
- D I V R Y – not valid  
- F I V R Y – not valid  
- L I P R Y – valid word “LIPLY” no, “LIPLY” not 5 letters  
- P I P R Y – not valid  
- W I D R Y – not valid  

Re-examining allowed letters and valid words, the only plausible word fitting _ I _ _ Y with R in position 1 is R I P P Y, but it’s not common.  

Another possibility: R I D D Y – D allowed, double D, but valid.  

R I D D Y:
- R in 1 (allowed)  
- I in 2 (required)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- D in 4 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (required)  

All letters allowed, and it fits the pattern.  

Thus, RIDDY is the best next guess.

Let’s reconcile all feedback carefully.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ R exists, not in position 1.  
   ⇒ A, O, S, E absent.

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
   ⇒ I is in position 2.  
   ⇒ R not in position 1 (consistent).  
   ⇒ G, H, T absent.

3. MIRKY → M(x) I(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ I confirmed in position 2.  
   ⇒ R confirmed in position 3.  
   ⇒ Y confirmed in position 5.  
   ⇒ M, K absent.

4. BRINY → B(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ R is in word but not in position 3 (contradicts MIRKY).  
   ⇒ I is in word but not in position 2 (contradicts MIRKY).  
   ⇒ B, N absent.  
   The only way both can be true is if the symbols are per-guess positional indicators, not absolute positions.  
   Therefore:  
   - From BRINY: R is in word but not in position 3 (so must be in 1,2,4,5)  
   - From MIRKY: R is in position 3 (✓)  
   These two statements cannot both be true unless the word has two Rs, which seems unlikely.  
   Re-reading the feedback rules: each letter’s symbol is relative to that guess, not cumulative.  
   So from MIRKY: I is in position 2 (✓), R is in position 3 (✓), Y is in position 5 (✓).  
   From BRINY: R is in word but not in position 3 (-), which contradicts R(✓) from MIRKY.  
   This suggests the feedback must be read strictly per-guess, and the positions are not absolute.  
   Therefore, the only certain facts are:  
   - Word ends with Y (position 5)  
   - I is in position 2 (from MIRKY)  
   - R is in word but NOT in position 3 (from BRINY)  
   - Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, M, K, B, N  
   - From RIDDY: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 1, I(✓) means I is in position 2, D(x) means D not in word, Y(✓) means Y in position 5.  
   So combining:  
   - Pattern: _ I _ _ Y  
   - R must be in position 4 (since it can’t be in 1,2,3,5)  
   - Therefore word is _ I _ R Y  
   - Position 1 and 3 must be from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, L, P, U, V, W  
   - From RIDDY, D is not in word (D(x)), so possible letters: C, F, L, P, U, V, W  
   Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting _ I _ R Y:  
   - C I V R Y – not valid  
   - F I V R Y – not valid  
   - L I P R Y – valid word “LIPLY” no, “LIPLY” not 5 letters  
   - P I P R Y – not valid  
   - W I D R Y – D forbidden  
   - C I R C Y – C allowed, but R already placed  
   - D I V R Y – D forbidden  
   The only plausible valid word is F I V E R – but ends with R, not Y.  
   Rechecking: _ I _ R Y  
   Valid English word: “PIVOT” – no.  
   “LIPLY” – no.  
   “CIVVY” – ends with Y but has VV.  
   “CIVVY” is valid: C I V V Y, but has two Vs and we don’t know about V yet.  
   Another: “WIPER” – ends with R.  
   “FIVER” – ends with R.  
   “PIVOT” – ends with T (forbidden).  
   “CIVVY” is the only 5-letter word ending with Y and having R in position 4 that fits all constraints: C I V V Y.  
   Letters: C, I, V, V, Y – all allowed (C, V not yet ruled out).  
   Thus, CIVVY is the next logical guess.

<guess>CIVVY</guess>",CIVVY,"Let’s reconcile all feedback carefully.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ R exists, not in position 1.  
   ⇒ A, O, S, E absent.

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
   ⇒ I is in position 2.  
   ⇒ R not in position 1 (consistent).  
   ⇒ G, H, T absent.

3. MIRKY → M(x) I(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ I confirmed in position 2.  
   ⇒ R confirmed in position 3.  
   ⇒ Y confirmed in position 5.  
   ⇒ M, K absent.

4. BRINY → B(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ R is in word but not in position 3 (contradicts MIRKY).  
   ⇒ I is in word but not in position 2 (contradicts MIRKY).  
   ⇒ B, N absent.  
   The only way both can be true is if the symbols are per-guess positional indicators, not absolute positions.  
   Therefore:  
   - From BRINY: R is in word but not in position 3 (so must be in 1,2,4,5)  
   - From MIRKY: R is in position 3 (✓)  
   These two statements cannot both be true unless the word has two Rs, which seems unlikely.  
   Re-reading the feedback rules: each letter’s symbol is relative to that guess, not cumulative.  
   So from MIRKY: I is in position 2 (✓), R is in position 3 (✓), Y is in position 5 (✓).  
   From BRINY: R is in word but not in position 3 (-), which contradicts R(✓) from MIRKY.  
   This suggests the feedback must be read strictly per-guess, and the positions are not absolute.  
   Therefore, the only certain facts are:  
   - Word ends with Y (position 5)  
   - I is in position 2 (from MIRKY)  
   - R is in word but NOT in position 3 (from BRINY)  
   - Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, M, K, B, N  
   - From RIDDY: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 1, I(✓) means I is in position 2, D(x) means D not in word, Y(✓) means Y in position 5.  
   So combining:  
   - Pattern: _ I _ _ Y  
   - R must be in position 4 (since it can’t be in 1,2,3,5)  
   - Therefore word is _ I _ R Y  
   - Position 1 and 3 must be from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, L, P, U, V, W  
   - From RIDDY, D is not in word (D(x)), so possible letters: C, F, L, P, U, V, W  
   Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting _ I _ R Y:

   - F I V R Y – not valid  
   - L I P R Y – valid word “LIPLY” no, “LIPLY” not 5 letters  
   - P I P R Y – not valid  
   - W I D R Y – D forbidden  
   - C I R C Y – C allowed, but R already placed  
   - D I V R Y – D forbidden  
   The only plausible valid word is F I V E R – but ends with R, not Y.  
   Rechecking: _ I _ R Y  
   Valid English word: “PIVOT” – no.  
   “LIPLY” – no.
