For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two correct letters early on, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _  
Letters we know are in the word: S, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R  

We still need to place S and E somewhere else, and we need three more letters (positions 1, 2, 4, 5) but position 3 is fixed as O.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Move S and E to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Possible candidates: STONE, SPOKE, SHONE, SLOPE, etc.

""STONE"" looks good because:
- It keeps O in position 3.
- Moves S to position 1 (new position) and E to position 5 (new position).
- Introduces T and N, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.
   - S is not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t in 1 from AROSE).
   - E is not in position 5 (already knew it wasn’t in 5 from AROSE).
   - T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters in word: S, E, O (O is in position 3).
- Letters NOT in word: A, R, T, N.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STONE feedback).
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE and STONE feedback).

Possible positions for S: 2, 5 (but 5 is excluded for E, not for S).
Possible positions for E: 2, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4:
Pattern: _ S O E _

We need a first letter that hasn’t been eliminated. Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick a common consonant like “L” for position 1:
L S O E _

Now we need a fifth letter. Common letters left: D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

“L” is already used in position 1, so try “D” for position 5:
L S O E D

Check if this is a valid word: “LSOED” – no, that’s not a word.

Try “H” for position 5:
L S O E H – not a word.

Try “M” for position 5:
L S O E M – not a word.

Try “P” for position 5:
L S O E P – not a word.

Try “G” for position 5:
L S O E G – not a word.

Try “I” for position 5:
L S O E I – not a word.

Try “Y” for position 5:
L S O E Y – not a word.

Try “C” for position 5:
L S O E C – not a word.

Try “B” for position 5:
L S O E B – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe my placement is off.

Alternative: place S in position 5 and E in position 2 or 4.

Pattern: _ E O _ S or _ _ O E S

Let’s try _ E O _ S:
Possible first letter: common unused letters.

Try “H”:
H E O _ S – need a fourth letter. Try “L”:
H E O L S – “HEOLS” – not a word.

Try “M”:
H E O M S – not a word.

Try “K”:

Try “Z”:
H E O Z S – not a word.

This isn’t working. Maybe I should try a different placement.

Alternative placement: S in position 2 and E in position 4 again, but choose a different starting letter.

Pattern: _ S O E _

Try “C”:
C S O E _ – need fifth letter. Try “D”:
C S O E D – “CSOED” – not a word.

Try “M”:
C S O E M – not a word.

Try “P”:
C S O E P – not a word.

Try “G”:
C S O E G – not a word.

Try “H”:

Try “L”:
C S O E L – not a word.

Try “B”:
C S O E B – not a word.

Try “K”:
C S O E K – not a word.

Try “F”:
C S O E F – not a word.

Try “V”:
C S O E V – not a word.

Try “W”:
C S O E W – not a word.

Try “Y”:
C S O E Y – not a word.

Try “I”:
C S O E I – not a word.

Try “U”:
C S O E U – not a word.

Try “N”:
C S O E N – but N is already excluded.

Try “T”:
C S O E T – T is excluded.

Try “R”:
C S O E R – R is excluded.

Try “A”:
C S O E A – A is excluded.

Try “S”:
C S O E S – S is already in position 2.

Try “O”:

This seems problematic. Maybe S cannot be in position 2?

Try “H”:
H E O _ S – need fourth letter. Try “L”:
H E O L S – not a word.

Try “M”:
H E O M S – not a word.

Try “P”:

Try “K”:

Try “Z”:

This is frustrating. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternative: S in position 4 and E in position 2:

Try “H”:
H E O S _ – need fifth letter. Try “L”:
H E O S L – “HEOSL” – not a word.

Try “M”:

Try “K”:

Try “Z”:

Try “L”:

This isn’t working either. Maybe I need to try a different starting letter.

Alternative: start with “L” instead of H.

Pattern: _ _ O _ _
Known: S and E are in the word, O is in position 3.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 and E in position 2:

Try “B”:

Try “K”:

Try “N”:

Try “R”:

Try “A”:

Try “S”:
L E O S S – S is already in position 5.

H E O S B – not a word.

Try “K”:
H E O S K – not a word.

Try “Z”:
H E O S Z – not a word.

Try “L”:
H E O S L – already not a word.

This seems impossible with these constraints. Maybe I should try a word that uses different letters.

Alternative: try “SPOKE” – but P and K haven’t been tested, but let’s see.

SPOKE:
S(-) P(x) O(✓) K(x) E(-)

But this would give us feedback on P and K, which might not help.

But let’s check if this fits our constraints:
- O is in position 3 – yes.
- S and E are in the word – yes.
- A, R, T, N are not in the word – P and K are new.

But this seems like a stretch.

Alternative: try “SLOPE”:
S(-) L(x) O(✓) P(x) E(-)

But L and P are new, and we already know S and E are in the word.

But this might not be optimal.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 3, containing S and E, and excluding A, R, T, N.

Possible candidates:
- SPOKE (but P and K are new)
- SLOPE (L and P are new)
- SHOVE (H, V are new)
- SHOPE (H is new)
- SCOPE (C is new)
- SOPEL (but L is new)
- SPORE (R is excluded)
- SMOKE (M, K are new)
- SMOTE (M, T is excluded)
- SNORE (N is excluded)
- SCONE (N is excluded)
- SCOPE (C is new)
- SHOVE (H, V are new)
- SHOPE (H is new)
- SPOKE (P, K are new)
- SLOPE (L, P are new)

From these, “SHOVE” seems promising as it introduces H and V, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Let’s try SHOVE:
S(-) H(x) O(✓) V(x) E(-)

This will tell us about H and V, and confirm positions of S and E.

But wait, in SHOVE:
- S is in position 1 (still -)
- E is in position 5 (still -)

This might not give us new information.

Alternative: try “SCOPE”:
S(-) C(x) O(✓) P(x) E(-)

This introduces C and P.

Another option: “SMOTE” – but T is excluded.

“SLOPE” introduces L and P.

“SPOKE” introduces P and K.

“SHOVE” introduces H and V.

Among these, “SLOPE” seems to introduce two new letters (L and P) and fits the constraints.

Let’s try SLOPE:
S(-) L(x) O(✓) P(x) E(-)

This will give us feedback on L and P, and confirm positions of S and E.

But we already know S and E are in the word but not in their current positions. In SLOPE, S is in position 1 (still -), E is in position 5 (still -), which is consistent with previous feedback.

This seems like the best available option to gather more information.

<guess>SLOPE</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, I know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains both S and E, but neither is in its current position (S not in 1, E not in 5).
- Letters A, R, T, N are excluded.

I need a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Moves S and E to new positions.
3. Introduces new common letters (L and P are good candidates).

SLOPE fits these criteria:
- O is in position 3.
- S moves from position 1 to 1 (still -), E moves from 5 to 5 (still -) – this is expected.
- Introduces L and P, which haven't been tested yet.

<guess>SLOPE</guess>",SLOPE,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.
   - S is not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t in 1 from AROSE).
   - E is not in position 5 (already knew it wasn’t in 5 from AROSE).
   - T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters in word: S, E, O (O is in position 3).
- Letters NOT in word: A, R, T, N.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STONE feedback).
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE and STONE feedback).

Possible positions for S: 2, 5 (but 5 is excluded for E, not for S).
Possible positions for E: 2, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4:
Pattern: _ S O E _

We need a first letter that hasn’t been eliminated. Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick a common consonant like “L” for position 1:
L S O E _

Now we need a fifth letter. Common letters left: D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

“L” is already used in position 1, so try “D” for position 5:
L S O E D

Check if this is a valid word: “LSOED” – no, that’s not a word.

Try “H” for position 5:
L S O E H – not a word.

Try “M” for position 5:

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe my placement is off.

Alternative: try “SPOKE” – but P and K haven’t been tested, but let’s see.

SPOKE:

But let’s check if this fits our constraints:
- O is in position 3 – yes.

But L and P are new, and we already know S and E are in the word.

But this might not be optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two correct letters early on, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _  
Letters we know are in the word: S, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R  

We still need to place S and E somewhere else, and we need three more letters (positions 1, 2, 4, 5) but position 3 is fixed as O.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Move S and E to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Possible candidates: STONE, SPOKE, SHONE, SLOPE, etc.

""STONE"" looks good because:
- It keeps O in position 3.
- Moves S to position 1 (new position) and E to position 5 (new position).
- Introduces T and N, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.
   - S is not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t in 1 from AROSE).
   - E is not in position 5 (already knew it wasn’t in 5 from AROSE).
   - T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters in word: S, E, O (O is in position 3).
- Letters NOT in word: A, R, T, N.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STONE feedback).
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE and STONE feedback).

Possible positions for S: 2, 5 (but 5 is excluded for E, not for S).
Possible positions for E: 2, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4:
Pattern: _ S O E _

We need a first letter that hasn’t been eliminated. Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick a common consonant like “L” for position 1:

Now we need a fifth letter. Common letters left: D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

This seems impossible with these constraints. Maybe I should try a word that uses different letters.

Alternative: try “SPOKE” – but P and K haven’t been tested, but let’s see.

SPOKE:
S(-) P(x) O(✓) K(x) E(-)

But this would give us feedback on P and K, which might not help.

But let’s check if this fits our constraints:
- O is in position 3 – yes.
- S and E are in the word – yes.
- A, R, T, N are not in the word – P and K are new.

But this seems like a stretch.

Alternative: try “SLOPE”:
S(-) L(x) O(✓) P(x) E(-)

But L and P are new, and we already know S and E are in the word.

But this might not be optimal.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 3, containing S and E, and excluding A, R, T, N.

Possible candidates:
- SPOKE (but P and K are new)
- SLOPE (L and P are new)
- SHOVE (H, V are new)
- SHOPE (H is new)
- SCOPE (C is new)
- SOPEL (but L is new)
- SPORE (R is excluded)
- SMOKE (M, K are new)
- SMOTE (M, T is excluded)
- SNORE (N is excluded)
- SCONE (N is excluded)
- SCOPE (C is new)
- SHOVE (H, V are new)
- SHOPE (H is new)
- SPOKE (P, K are new)
- SLOPE (L, P are new)

From these, “SHOVE” seems promising as it introduces H and V, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Let’s try SHOVE:
S(-) H(x) O(✓) V(x) E(-)

This will tell us about H and V, and confirm positions of S and E.

But wait, in SHOVE:
- S is in position 1 (still -)
- E is in position 5 (still -)

This might not give us new information.

Alternative: try “SCOPE”:
S(-) C(x) O(✓) P(x) E(-)

This introduces C and P.

Another option: “SMOTE” – but T is excluded.

“SLOPE” introduces L and P.

“SPOKE” introduces P and K.

“SHOVE” introduces H and V.

Among these, “SLOPE” seems to introduce two new letters (L and P) and fits the constraints.

Let’s try SLOPE:
S(-) L(x) O(✓) P(x) E(-)

This will give us feedback on L and P, and confirm positions of S and E.

But we already know S and E are in the word but not in their current positions. In SLOPE, S is in position 1 (still -), E is in position 5 (still -), which is consistent with previous feedback.

This seems like the best available option to gather more information.

<guess>SLOPE</guess>Based on the feedback so far, I know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains both S and E, but neither is in its current position (S not in 1, E not in 5).
- Letters A, R, T, N are excluded.

I need a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Moves S and E to new positions.
3. Introduces new common letters (L and P are good candidates).

SLOPE fits these criteria:
- O is in position 3.
- S moves from position 1 to 1 (still -), E moves from 5 to 5 (still -) – this is expected.
- Introduces L and P, which haven't been tested yet.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. STONE → S(-) T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Confirms O in position 3.
   - S is not in position 1 (already known).
   - E is not in position 5 (already known).
   - T and N are not in the word.

3. SLOPE → S(-) L(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word and in position 2.
   - O is confirmed in position 3.
   - S is still not in position 1 (consistent).
   - E is still not in position 5 (consistent).
   - P is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L O _ _
- Letters in word: S, E, L, O
- Letters not in word: A, R, T, N, P
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SLOPE feedback).
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE and SLOPE feedback).

Possible positions for S: 2, 5 (but 2 is taken by L), so S must be in position 5.
Possible positions for E: 2, 4 (but 2 is taken by L), so E must be in position 4.

Thus the pattern is: _ L O E S

We need a first letter that hasn't been excluded. Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in LOES... The only common word is ""BLOES"" (variant spelling of ""bloesem"", but not common) or ""FLOES"" (as in ice floes).

""FLOES"" is a valid English word meaning ""a piece of floating ice"".

Let's check:
- F is new and not excluded.
- L is confirmed in position 2.
- O in position 3.
- E in position 4.
- S in position 5.

This fits all constraints.
