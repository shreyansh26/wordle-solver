For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would combine these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E (each once).
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that uses O, S, E plus two other letters (not A or R), and respects the positional constraints.

Good candidates:
- Words that place O, S, E in different positions from before.
- Include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must include O, S, E in some order, but not in their previous spots (O≠3, S≠4, E≠5).

Let’s try ""STONE"":
- S in position 1 (was 4, so OK)
- T (new letter)
- O in position 2 (was 3, so OK)
- N (new letter)
- E in position 5 (was 5, so this violates E≠5)

So ""STONE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5 again.

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- S in position 1 (OK)
- P (new letter)
- O in position 3 (invalid, O was in 3 before)

Next try ""POSED"":
- P (new letter)
- O in position 2 (OK)

This seems valid: uses O, S, E in new positions and introduces two new letters (P, D) that weren't in the first guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would combine these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it includes:

We need a new 5-letter word that uses O, S, E plus two other letters (not A or R), and respects the positional constraints.

Good candidates:
- Words that place O, S, E in different positions from before.
- Include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must include O, S, E in some order, but not in their previous spots (O≠3, S≠4, E≠5).

Let’s try ""STONE"":
- S in position 1 (was 4, so OK)
- T (new letter)
- O in position 2 (was 3, so OK)
- N (new letter)
- E in position 5 (was 5, so this violates E≠5)

So ""STONE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5 again.

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- S in position 1 (OK)
- P (new letter)
- O in position 3 (invalid, O was in 3 before)

Next try ""POSED"":
- P (new letter)
- O in position 2 (OK)
- S in position 3 (was 4, OK)
- E in position 4 (was 5, OK)
- D (new letter)

This seems valid: uses O, S, E in new positions and introduces two new letters (P, D) that weren't in the first guess.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

So the secret word now looks like:
- Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not yet ruled out)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown (but must include S somewhere, and S is not here)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown

Letters we know are in the word: O, S, E
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, P, D

We still need to place S somewhere other than position 3, and we need two more letters (for positions 1 and 5) that haven't been ruled out and are common.

Possible structure: _ O _ E _ with S appearing once more (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 3 in POSED feedback shows S is not at 3, so S could be 1 or 5).

Let's consider:
- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, avoiding letters A, R, P, D.

Possible candidates:
- S O _ E _: could be ""SONIC"" but C is allowed, but we need to check letters. However, ""SONIC"" uses I and C which are allowed.
- _ O _ E S: could be ""COVES"" but V is allowed.

But we need to check which letters are allowed. From feedback, forbidden letters are A, R, P, D. Other letters are allowed unless they appeared as x.

Looking at common letters: T, N, L, C, I, M, etc.

Let's try ""SONIC"":
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (matches)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (but E must be in position 4, so this is invalid)

Next try ""COVES"":
- C in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (matches)
- V in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (matches)
- S in position 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains O (position 2) and E (position 4) correctly.
- Contains S in position 5 (was in 3 before, so new position is OK).
- Uses allowed letters C, V.

This seems like a good next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would combine these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.

- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E (each once).
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that uses O, S, E plus two other letters (not A or R), and respects the positional constraints.

- Include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

- T (new letter)
- O in position 2 (was 3, so OK)

A good first guess would combine these. \n\n""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it includes:\n- A: very common vowel\n- R: common consonant\n- O: common vowel\n- S: very common consonant\n- E: most common letter in English\n\nThis gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is not in the word.\n- R(x) → R is not in the word.\n- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).\n- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).\n- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains O, S, E (each once).\n- Does NOT contain A or R.\n- O is NOT in position 3.\n- S is NOT in position 4.\n- E is NOT in position 5.\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that uses O, S, E plus two other letters (not A or R), and respects the positional constraints.\n\nGood candidates:\n- Words that place O, S, E in different positions from before.\n- Include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.\n\nPossible structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must include O, S, E in some order, but not in their previous spots (O≠3, S≠4, E≠5).\n\nLet’s try ""STONE"":\n- S in position 1 (was 4, so OK)\n- T (new letter)\n- O in position 2 (was 3, so OK)\n- N (new letter)\n- E in position 5 (was 5, so this violates E≠5)\n\nSo ""STONE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5 again.\n\nNext try ""SPOKE"":\n- S in position 1 (OK)\n- P (new letter)\n- O in position 3 (invalid, O was in 3 before)\n\nNext try ""POSED"":\n- P (new letter)\n- O in position 2 (OK)\n- S in position 3 (was 4, OK)\n- E in position 4 (was 5, OK)\n- D (new letter)\n\nThis seems valid: uses O, S, E in new positions and introduces two new letters (P, D) that weren\'t in the first guess.\n\n<guess>POSED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on POSED:\n- P(x) → P is not in the word.\n- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).\n- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n- D(x) → D is not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word now looks like:\n- Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not yet ruled out)\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 3: unknown (but must include S somewhere, and S is not here)\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- Position 5: unknown\n\nLetters we know are in the word: O, S, E\nLetters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, P, D\n\nWe still need to place S somewhere other than position 3, and we need two more letters (for positions 1 and 5) that haven\'t been ruled out and are common.\n\nPossible structure: _ O _ E _ with S appearing once more (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 3 in POSED feedback shows S is not at 3, so S could be 1 or 5).\n\nLet\'s consider:\n- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _\n- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S\n\nLooking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, avoiding letters A, R, P, D.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- S O _ E _: could be ""SONIC"" but C is allowed, but we need to check letters.

From the feedback on COMES:
- C(✓) – position 1 correct
- O(✓) – position 2 correct  
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word
- E(✓) – position 4 correct
- S(✓) – position 5 correct

So the word must be exactly C O _ E S, and the blank (position 3) cannot be M or any of the already-eliminated letters: A, R, P, D, V, M.

Common letters still allowed for position 3 include B, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, T, etc.

Looking for 5-letter English words of the form “CO_E_S”:
- COBES – not a standard word
- COFES – not a word
- COGES – not a word
- COHES – not a word
- COI_E_S – no
- COKES – slang, not standard
- COLVES – too long
- CONES – valid word
- COSTS – but S is already fixed at position 5, and T is allowed.

The only clear, common candidate is CONES.

Check letters:
- C, O, N, E, S – none are in the eliminated list (except N hasn’t been tested yet).
