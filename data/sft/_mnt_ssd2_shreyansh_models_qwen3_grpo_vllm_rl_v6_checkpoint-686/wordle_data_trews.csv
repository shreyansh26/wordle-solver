### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word is often ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: T R _ _ S  (positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed)
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: T, R, E, S  
   – E is still “in word but wrong place”; it cannot be in position 4 (from TRIES feedback) or 5 (from AROSE feedback), so E must be in position 3.
3. Letters that are definitely out: A, O, I

Therefore the hidden word has the form: T R E _ S  
Only the fourth letter is unknown, and it must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Common unused consonants: C, D, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y  
Among these, “C” and “N” and “L” are very frequent.  
A quick check of valid English 5-letter words fitting T R E _ S gives:

- TRENS  (not a common word)  
- TREKS  (valid)  
- TREWS  (valid but rare)  
- TREES  (but E already used in position 3)  
- TRELS  (not a word)

“TREKS” is the most common and likely correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word is often ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- 2nd letter is R
- S and E are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- A and O are not in the word at all

Good letters to keep: R (fixed), S, E
Bad letters to avoid: A, O

Possible positions for S and E:
- S cannot be in position 4
- E cannot be in position 5

I want to place S and E in new positions while keeping R in place. Also, I need to introduce new common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.).

A good next guess would be ""TRIES"":
- T: new letter
- R: correct position (2)
- I: new letter
- E: moved to position 4 (was 5)
- S: moved to position 5 (was 4)

This tests new letters T and I while repositioning S and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: T R _ _ S  (positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed)
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: T, R, E, S  
   – E is still “in word but wrong place”; it cannot be in position 4 (from TRIES feedback) or 5 (from AROSE feedback), so E must be in position 3.
3. Letters that are definitely out: A, O, I

Therefore the hidden word has the form: T R E _ S  
Only the fourth letter is unknown, and it must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Common unused consonants: C, D, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y  
Among these, “C” and “N” and “L” are very frequent.  
A quick check of valid English 5-letter words fitting T R E _ S gives:

- TRENS  (not a common word)  
- TREKS  (valid)  
- TREWS  (valid but rare)  
- TREES  (but E already used in position 3)  
- TRELS  (not a word)  
- TREMS  (not a word)  

“TREKS” is the most common and likely correct.

Hence I will guess TREKS.

The only common unused consonants left for the 4th position are C, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y.

Valid English words fitting T R E _ S:

- TREWS (valid but uncommon)
- TREMS (not a word)
- TREPS (not a word)
- TREYS (not a word)
- TREGS (not a word)
- TRELs (not a word)

The most plausible remaining word is ""TRESS"", even though it repeats the S. However, since S is already confirmed at position 5, position 4 cannot be S (as that would require two S's in the word, which is possible but less common). 

But looking again, ""TREWS"" is valid (though rare), and ""TRESS"" is more common. However, ""TRESS"" would be T R E S S, which is acceptable in English.

But let me double-check: are there any other words? ""TREES"" is invalid (E already at position 3). ""TREWS"" is valid (a type of shoe or the bird). 

Given that, ""TREWS"" is the best remaining choice. However, since we have only one position left and limited options, and considering frequency, ""TREWS"" is more likely.
