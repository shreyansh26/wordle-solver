### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to test multiple positions.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to test multiple positions.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to test multiple positions.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R, but R is not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain C, A, or N.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains R (but not in position 2)
- Avoids C, A, N
- Uses other common letters to test new positions

Good candidate letters left: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STORE"":
- Ends with E (matches known info)
- Contains R (not in position 2, so could be 3 or 4)
- Avoids C, A, N
- Tests new letters S, T, O

Another option is ""ROUSE"" but that has R in position 1 which is allowed, but ""STORE"" seems more likely to reveal useful info about R's position.

I'll go with STORE.

   - O is NOT in position 3 (STORE) → O must be in 1, 2, or 4.
3. The word does NOT contain C, A, N, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Uses R, T, and O exactly once each.
- Places R in position 1 or 3.
- Places T in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Places O in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try to fit R, T, O plus one more letter (not C, A, N, S) into the pattern.

One promising pattern: R _ O _ E (R in 1, O in 3) → needs T in 4 → ROT_E → but that’s only 4 letters.

Now we have:

- Pattern: _ O R T E  
- All letters except the first are locked in place (O, R, T, E are all in their correct spots).  
- The first letter is NOT F (from FORTE feedback: F(x)) and NOT any of C, A, N, S, U (from earlier rounds).  

Valid 5-letter English words that fit _ O R T E and do not start with F, C, A, N, S, U:

- B, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y can all precede ORTE to form real words.

Scanning the list:

- BORTE – not a recognized word  
- DORTE – not a recognized word  
- GORTE – not a recognized word  
- HORTE – not a recognized word  
- LORTE – not a recognized word  
- MORTE – not a recognized word  
- PORTE – not a recognized word  
- VORTE – not a recognized word  
- WORTE – not a recognized word  
- YORTE – not a recognized word  

None of these are standard English words. This suggests an inconsistency—likely I misread a constraint. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Looking back at Guess 4 (FORTE):
- F(x) → F is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (already known).
- R(✓) → R is in position 3 (✓).
- T(✓) → T is in position 4 (✓).
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is indeed _ O R T E, with R confirmed in position 3.

The only valid English word that matches _ O R T E is “PORTE” (a variant spelling of “porte” in some contexts), but it is not standard. The next possible candidate is “BORTE,” which also does not exist.

However, the word “CORTE” is valid (a type of knife), but C was ruled out in Guess 1 (CRANE → C(x)).

This leaves no standard English word. This implies an error in earlier assumption. Rechecking the feedback:

Guess 3 (ROUTE) gave R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 1.  
Guess 4 (FORTE) gave R(✓) → R is in position 3.

Thus the pattern is _ O R T E. The only valid English word fitting this is “PORTE,” but it is not recognized. This suggests the actual word must be “PORT E” with a space, but that is 6 letters.

Realizing the oversight: the correct word is “PORTE” in some dialects or languages, but in standard English, the only possible word is “CORTE,” which was ruled out. This indicates the word must be “PORTE,” and the feedback should have accepted it, despite its rarity.

Given the constraints, the only possible word left is:
