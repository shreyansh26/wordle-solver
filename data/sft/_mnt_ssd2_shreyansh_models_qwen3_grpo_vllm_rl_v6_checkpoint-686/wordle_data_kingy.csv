For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many English words
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.

I still want a word that uses common remaining letters and covers both vowels and consonants.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters:  
- Vowels left: I, U  
- Consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- Uses two new vowels (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, Y).  
- All letters are not yet ruled out.  
- It’s a common word and gives broad coverage of the remaining alphabet.

(Alternative candidates could be “UNTIL”, “CUBIC”, etc., but UNITY is simple and covers fresh letters.)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: N, I.
- Letter that IS in the correct position: Y (last letter).

So the secret word ends with Y and contains N and I somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Possible positions for N and I:
- N cannot be in position 2.
- I cannot be in position 3.

I need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes both N and I, with the above constraints.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N and I must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded for them).
- Possible combinations:
  - N I _ _ Y → N and I in positions 1 and 2, but I cannot be in position 3 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
  - N _ I _ Y → N in 1, I in 3 → valid (I not in 3 is already satisfied).
  - N _ _ I Y → N in 1, I in 4 → valid.
  - _ N I _ Y → N in 2 is invalid (from feedback).
  - _ N _ I Y → N in 2 is invalid.
  - _ _ N I Y → N in 3 is invalid (I cannot be in 3, but N can be in 3; however I would be in 4, which is allowed).
  - _ _ I N Y → I in 3 is invalid.
  - I N _ _ Y → N in 2 is invalid.
  - I _ N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed (I not in 3 is satisfied).
  - I _ _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.
  - _ I N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed.
  - _ I _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.
  - _ _ N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed.
  - _ _ _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns. A good candidate is “INNY” but that’s only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Consider “INNY” + a letter → but we need to keep it 5 letters.

Another approach: list 5-letter words ending in Y with N and I, excluding the banned letters.

Possible words:
- “INLAY” (I, N, L, A, Y) → A is banned.
- “INDIA” → ends with A, banned.
- “INKY” → 4 letters.
- “INNY” → 4 letters.
- “NINNY” → 5 letters, but N is repeated and ends with Y. However, N is already confirmed in the word, but we don’t know if it’s repeated. Also, N in position 2 is invalid (from feedback).

Another candidate: “LINEN” → ends with N, not Y.

“MINCY” → ends with Y, has M, I, N, C, Y. But C is allowed, M is allowed. Let’s check positions:
- M I N C Y → I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed. This seems valid.

But is “MINCY” a valid word? It’s a variant spelling of “mince” or a name, but might be obscure.

Better choice: “DINGY” → D, I, N, G, Y.
- D, I, N, G, Y: none are banned.
- Positions: I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed.
- All letters are fresh except N and I which are confirmed in the word.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Another: “HINGY” → H, I, N, G, Y → same reasoning.

Between “DINGY” and “HINGY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “DINGY”.

- “INNY” → 4 letters.
- “NINNY” → 5 letters, but N is repeated and ends with Y. However, N is already confirmed in the word, but we don’t know if it’s repeated. Also, N in position 2 is invalid (from feedback).

Another candidate: “LINEN” → ends with N, not Y.

“MINCY” → ends with Y, has M, I, N, C, Y. But C is allowed, M is allowed. Let’s check positions:
- M I N C Y → I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed. This seems valid.

But is “MINCY” a valid word? It’s a variant spelling of “mince” or a name, but might be obscure.

Better choice: “DINGY” → D, I, N, G, Y.
- D, I, N, G, Y: none are banned.
- Positions: I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed.
- All letters are fresh except N and I which are confirmed in the word.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Another: “HINGY” → H, I, N, G, Y → same reasoning.

Between “DINGY” and “HINGY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “DINGY”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many English words
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.

I still want a word that uses common remaining letters and covers both vowels and consonants.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters:  
- Vowels left: I, U  
- Consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- Uses two new vowels (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, Y).  
- All letters are not yet ruled out.  
- It’s a common word and gives broad coverage of the remaining alphabet.

(Alternative candidates could be “UNTIL”, “CUBIC”, etc., but UNITY is simple and covers fresh letters.)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: N, I.
- Letter that IS in the correct position: Y (last letter).

So the secret word ends with Y and contains N and I somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Possible positions for N and I:
- N cannot be in position 2.
- I cannot be in position 3.

I need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes both N and I, with the above constraints.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N and I must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded for them).
- Possible combinations:
  - N I _ _ Y → N and I in positions 1 and 2, but I cannot be in position 3 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
  - N _ I _ Y → N in 1, I in 3 → valid (I not in 3 is already satisfied).
  - N _ _ I Y → N in 1, I in 4 → valid.
  - _ N I _ Y → N in 2 is invalid (from feedback).
  - _ N _ I Y → N in 2 is invalid.
  - _ _ N I Y → N in 3 is invalid (I cannot be in 3, but N can be in 3; however I would be in 4, which is allowed).
  - _ _ I N Y → I in 3 is invalid.
  - I N _ _ Y → N in 2 is invalid.
  - I _ N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed (I not in 3 is satisfied).
  - I _ _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.
  - _ I N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed.
  - _ I _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.
  - _ _ N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed.
  - _ _ _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns. A good candidate is “INNY” but that’s only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Consider “INNY” + a letter → but we need to keep it 5 letters.

Another approach: list 5-letter words ending in Y with N and I, excluding the banned letters.

Possible words:
- “INLAY” (I, N, L, A, Y) → A is banned.
- “INDIA” → ends with A, banned.
- “INKY” → 4 letters.
- “INNY” → 4 letters.
- “NINNY” → 5 letters, but N is repeated and ends with Y. However, N is already confirmed in the word, but we don’t know if it’s repeated. Also, N in position 2 is invalid (from feedback).

Another candidate: “LINEN” → ends with N, not Y.

“MINCY” → ends with Y, has M, I, N, C, Y. But C is allowed, M is allowed. Let’s check positions:
- M I N C Y → I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed. This seems valid.

But is “MINCY” a valid word? It’s a variant spelling of “mince” or a name, but might be obscure.

Better choice: “DINGY” → D, I, N, G, Y.
- D, I, N, G, Y: none are banned.
- Positions: I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed.
- All letters are fresh except N and I which are confirmed in the word.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Another: “HINGY” → H, I, N, G, Y → same reasoning.

Between “DINGY” and “HINGY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “DINGY”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many English words
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.

I still want a word that uses common remaining letters and covers both vowels and consonants.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters:  
- Vowels left: I, U  
- Consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- Uses two new vowels (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, Y).  
- All letters are not yet ruled out.  
- It’s a common word and gives broad coverage of the remaining alphabet.

(Alternative candidates could be “UNTIL”, “CUBIC”, etc., but UNITY is simple and covers fresh letters.)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: N, I.
- Letter that IS in the correct position: Y (last letter).

So the secret word ends with Y and contains N and I somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Possible positions for N and I:
- N cannot be in position 2.
- I cannot be in position 3.

I need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes both N and I, with the above constraints.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N and I must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded for them).
- Possible combinations:
  - N I _ _ Y → N and I in positions 1 and 2, but I cannot be in position 3 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
  - N _ I _ Y → N in 1, I in 3 → valid (I not in 3 is already satisfied).
  - N _ _ I Y → N in 1, I in 4 → valid.
  - _ N I _ Y → N in 2 is invalid (from feedback).
  - _ N _ I Y → N in 2 is invalid.
  - _ _ N I Y → N in 3 is invalid (I cannot be in 3, but N can be in 3; however I would be in 4, which is allowed).
  - _ _ I N Y → I in 3 is invalid.
  - I N _ _ Y → N in 2 is invalid.
  - I _ N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed (I not in 3 is satisfied).
  - I _ _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.
  - _ I N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed.
  - _ I _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.
  - _ _ N _ Y → N in 3 is allowed.
  - _ _ _ N Y → N in 4 is allowed.

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns. A good candidate is “INNY” but that’s only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Consider “INNY” + a letter → but we need to keep it 5 letters.

Another approach: list 5-letter words ending in Y with N and I, excluding the banned letters.

Possible words:
- “INLAY” (I, N, L, A, Y) → A is banned.
- “INDIA” → ends with A, banned.
- “INKY” → 4 letters.
- “INNY” → 4 letters.
- “NINNY” → 5 letters, but N is repeated and ends with Y. However, N is already confirmed in the word, but we don’t know if it’s repeated. Also, N in position 2 is invalid (from feedback).

Another candidate: “LINEN” → ends with N, not Y.

“MINCY” → ends with Y, has M, I, N, C, Y. But C is allowed, M is allowed. Let’s check positions:
- M I N C Y → I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed. This seems valid.

But is “MINCY” a valid word? It’s a variant spelling of “mince” or a name, but might be obscure.

Better choice: “DINGY” → D, I, N, G, Y.
- D, I, N, G, Y: none are banned.
- Positions: I in 2 is allowed (only I in 3 is banned), N in 3 is allowed.
- All letters are fresh except N and I which are confirmed in the word.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Another: “HINGY” → H, I, N, G, Y → same reasoning.

Between “DINGY” and “HINGY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “DINGY”.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters completely ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, D.
2. Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct positions:
   - I in position 2
   - N in position 3
   - G in position 4
   - Y in position 5
3. The only unknown position is position 1.

So the word pattern is: _ I N G Y.

We need a 5-letter word that matches this pattern. The first letter must be a letter not yet ruled out (not in the banned list above).

Possible first letters (common ones not banned): B, C, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Looking at common English words ending in ""INGY"":
- BINGY (not a standard word)
- CINGY (not standard)
- FINGY (not standard)
- HINGY (valid word meaning ""pertaining to hinge"")
- LINGY (not standard)
- MINCY (not standard)
- PINGY (slang, not standard)
- WINGY (valid word meaning ""poorly built"")

Between ""HINGY"" and ""WINGY"", both fit. ""HINGY"" is more common. Let's go with that.

However, we need to ensure the first letter hasn't been ruled out. H is not in the banned list, so ""HINGY"" is valid.
