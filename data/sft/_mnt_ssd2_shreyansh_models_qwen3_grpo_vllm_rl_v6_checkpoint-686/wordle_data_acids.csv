### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. Contains S somewhere except position 4.
3. Does not contain R, O, E.

I want a word that:
- Starts with A
- Uses S in a different position (not 4)
- Avoids R, O, E
- Uses other common letters to gather more info

Good candidates: A, S, plus common letters like T, I, N, L, C, etc.

Let's try ""ASTIR"":
- A in position 1 (matches known ✓)
- S in position 2 (new position)
- T, I, R - but R is excluded, so this might not be best
Wait, R is out, so ASTIR is invalid.

Next try ""ASIDE"":
- A, S, I, D, E - but E is excluded.

Try ""ASLAN"":
- A, S, L, A, N - but A is already in position 1, and we don't know about double letters.

Better: ""ABASE"":
- A, B, A, S, E - E is excluded.

Try ""ASHEN"":
- A, S, H, E, N - E excluded.

""ASIDE"" invalid (E).

""ASUNT"":
- A, S, U, N, T - uses new letters U, N, T.

But maybe simpler: ""ASIDE"" invalid, ""ASHEN"" invalid, ""ARISE"" invalid (R).

Better: ""ABUZZ"" - but Z is uncommon.

""ACRID"" - R excluded.

""ACTIN"" - good letters, no R/O/E/S in wrong place.

But we know S is in word, so must include S.

""ACIDS"":
- A, C, I, D, S - all new letters except A (position 1), S (position 5, new position).

This seems good: tests C, I, D, and puts S in position 5.
