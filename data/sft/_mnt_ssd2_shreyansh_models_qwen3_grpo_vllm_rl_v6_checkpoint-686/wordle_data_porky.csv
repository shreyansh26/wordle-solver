For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately rules out every word containing any of those five letters.

To make a second guess we want:
1. A word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely.
2. A word that still uses very common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize new information.

The remaining high-frequency letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, G, M, P, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A strong second-guess candidate that uses five of these, none repeated, and is a common English word is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none of these appear in SLATE, so they’re all fresh.
- It tests three vowels (O, U) plus two common consonants (R, N, D).

Another good choice would be “CHURN” or “BRING”, but “ROUND” is simple and covers good ground.

So I’ll go with ROUND.

2. ROUND → R is in the word but in the wrong position (-), O is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓), and U, N, D are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _ (second letter is O).
- It contains R somewhere, but NOT in the 1st position.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately rules out every word containing any of those five letters.

To make a second guess we want:
1. A word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely.
2. A word that still uses very common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize new information.

The remaining high-frequency letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, G, M, P, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A strong second-guess candidate that uses five of these, none repeated, and is a common English word is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none of these appear in SLATE, so they’re all fresh.
- It tests three vowels (O, U) plus two common consonants (R, N, D).

Another good choice would be “CHURN” or “BRING”, but “ROUND” is simple and covers good ground.

So I’ll go with ROUND.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → all letters are NOT in the word (x on S, L, A, T, E).
2. ROUND → R is in the word but in the wrong position (-), O is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓), and U, N, D are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _ (second letter is O).
- It contains R somewhere, but NOT in the 1st position.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: C, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, B, F, J, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 2nd position.
- Contains R somewhere after the first letter.
- Uses only the remaining letters (no S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D).

Possible candidates:
- BORIC (but C is okay, I is okay, but R is in 3rd position, but O is 2nd)
- CORGI (but G, I, C, R – but R is 4th, O is 2nd)
- GORGE (but E is out)
- HORSE (E, S are out)
- HORDE (E, D are out)
- PORCH (P, O, R, C, H – O is 2nd, R is 3rd, none of the forbidden letters)

PORCH looks good:
- P, O, R, C, H – none of the forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D) are present.
- O is in the 2nd position (matches ✓).
- R is in the 3rd position (not in 1st, matches -).

Another check: is PORCH a valid 5-letter English word? Yes.

So I’ll go with PORCH.
