### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters without repeating any. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for elimination.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.

So we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E, A, O
- Letters definitely not in the word: S
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Contains A and O somewhere else (but A not in pos 1, O not in pos 3).
4. Does not contain S.

Possible candidates:
- BRAVE (but V is new, not sure)
- CRORE (but R repeats)
- GRADE (but D is new)
- BROKE (but K is new)
- CROAK (but C and K are new)

Let's try ""CROAK"":
- C R O A K
- R is in position 2 (correct)
- E is missing, so this doesn't fit (needs E in position 5)
Oops, that's wrong. Must have E in position 5.

Let's try ""BRAVE"":
- B R A V E
- R in position 2 (correct)
- E in position 5 (correct)
- A is in position 3 (not position 1, so allowed)
- O is missing, but we know O is in the word somewhere else - this won't work.

We must include O. So let's try ""ORANGE"" but that's 6 letters.

Wait, 5-letter words with R in position 2 and E in position 5, containing A and O:
- A in positions 3,4 (not 1)
- O in positions 1,3,4 (not 3 - wait, O is not in position 3 from feedback)

So O can be in positions 1,4.

Possible words:
- O R A _ E (but A can't be in position 3 if O is in 1)
- _ R A O E (but O can't be in position 4 if word ends with E)

Actually, positions:
1 2 3 4 5
? R ? ? E

A must be in 3 or 4 (not 1), O must be in 1,3, or 4 (not 3), and not repeat.

Possible:
- O R A _ E (but 4th letter must be O, but O is already in 1 - no)
- _ R A O E (but O in 4 is allowed, A in 3 is allowed)
- C R A O E (but is this a word? No)
- B R A O E (no)
- F R A O E (no)

Wait, let's think differently: O must be in 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 3), A must be in 3 or 4, and they can't both be in 4.

So two cases:
1. O in 1, A in 3 or 4:
   - O R A _ E (but 4th letter must be new, and word must end with E)
   - O R _ A E (but A in 4 is allowed)
   Possible: ORATE (but T is new)
2. O in 4, A in 3:
   - _ R A O E (but 1st letter must be new)
   Possible: C R A O E (no), B R A O E (no), G R A O E (no)

""ORATE"" seems possible:
- O R A T E
- R in 2 (correct)
- E in 5 (correct)
- A in 3 (not 1, allowed)
- O in 1 (not 3, allowed)
- T is new

Let's try ""ORATE"".
