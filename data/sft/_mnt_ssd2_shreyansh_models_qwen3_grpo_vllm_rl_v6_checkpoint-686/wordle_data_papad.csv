For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Uses none of S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, K, F, V, W, Y.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let me try a word like ""RADIO"":
- R, D, I, O are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 3 in SLATE).
- No S, L, T, E are used.

This should help determine if R, D, I, or O are in the word and where A might be positioned.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Uses none of S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, K, F, V, W, Y.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let me try a word like ""RADIO"":
- R, D, I, O are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 3 in SLATE).
- No S, L, T, E are used.

This should help determine if R, D, I, or O are in the word and where A might be positioned.

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, T, E, R, I, O.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
   - D is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5).

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ _

and the word must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining consonants that have not been ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Remaining vowels that have not been ruled out: U (since A is already placed and we’ve had no info on U).

We want a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has D in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “BADLY”:
- B (new, allowed), A (correct position 2), D (in position 3, but we know D must be in 1,4,5; so this is invalid because D was in position 3 in RADIO and feedback said it’s in the word but wrong position, so it can’t be in 3 again).
Wait, that’s invalid.

Let’s try “MADGY”:
- M, A (position 2), D (position 3 again) – still invalid.

Let’s try “DABBY”:
- D (position 1, allowed), A (position 2, correct), B, B – but double B and we don’t know if B is allowed. Also, we have no info on B yet.

Let’s try “CADDY”:
- C, A (position 2), D (position 3 again) – invalid.

Let’s try “WADUP”:
- W, A (position 2), D (position 3) – invalid.

Let’s try “PADDY”:
- P, A (position 2), D (position 3) – invalid.

Let’s try “GADID”:
- G, A (position 2), D (position 3) – invalid.

Let’s try “DAMMY”:
- D (position 1, allowed), A (position 2), M, M, Y – all letters allowed and not yet ruled out. This fits the constraints: A is in position 2, D is in position 1 (a new position), and no forbidden letters are used.

Therefore, the next guess is “DAMMY”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, M, Y, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓)  
- P is in position 1 (✓)

Letters confirmed IN the word but wrong positions:
- D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from DAMMY, PANDA, RADIO).  
  Therefore D must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so my earlier deduction must be wrong.

Re-examining D placement:

- RADIO: D in position 3 → wrong position (so D ≠ 3)  
- DAMMY: D in position 1 → wrong position (so D ≠ 1)  
- PANDA: D in position 4 → wrong position (so D ≠ 4)  

Thus D must be in position 5 (only remaining spot).

Current pattern: P A _ _ D

Letters used so far: P, A, D  
Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, M, Y, N

Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word matching P A _ _ D with letters from the remaining set.

Possible combinations:
- P A C K D → PACKD (not a word)  
- P A P A D → PAPAD (valid word, means papaya in some contexts, but is a 5-letter word)  
- P A U S D → PAUSD (invalid)

- P A G E D → PAGED (invalid)

- D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from DAMMY, PANDA, RADIO).  
  Therefore D must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so my earlier deduction must be wrong.

Re-examining D placement:

- RADIO: D in position 3 → wrong position (so D ≠ 3)  
- DAMMY: D in position 1 → wrong position (so D ≠ 1)  
- PANDA: D in position 4 → wrong position (so D ≠ 4)  

Thus D must be in position 5 (only remaining spot).

Current pattern: P A _ _ D

Letters used so far: P, A, D  
Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, M, Y, N

Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word matching P A _ _ D with letters from the remaining set.

Possible combinations:
- P A C K D → PACKD (not a word)  
- P A P A D → PAPAD (valid word, means papaya in some contexts, but is a 5-letter word)  
- P A U S D → PAUSD (invalid)  
- P A V E D → PAVID (invalid)  
- P A G E D → PAGED (invalid)  
- P A C E D → PACED (invalid)  
- P A C K D → PACKD (invalid)  

The only plausible word is PAPAD.

Thus, the next guess is PAPAD.",Guess 5: PAPAD -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) P(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
