### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to see which letters are present in the secret word and potentially their positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

Current knowledge:

- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, M, C, K  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): U, Y  

We still need to place U and Y correctly while avoiding all eliminated letters.  
Remaining common letters to fill the other three slots: D, L, G, H, P, B, F, W, V, etc.

We want a 5-letter word containing both U and Y (each only once) and three fresh letters from the still-allowed set.  
Try to put U and Y in positions they did NOT occupy before:

- In UNITY: U was 1st, Y 5th → avoid 1st for U, 5th for Y.  
- In MUCKY: U was 2nd, Y 5th → avoid 2nd for U, 5th for Y.

So U could be 3rd or 4th, Y could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Candidate word: “FLUID” – but F, L, U, I, D: I is already ruled out.  
Another: “BUGGY” – repeats G and Y, and G is allowed, but double G is okay; however Y is 5th again, which we want to avoid.  
Better: “HUMPY” – H, U, M, P, Y: M is ruled out.  
Next: “GULPY” – G, U, L, P, Y: all letters are still allowed, and neither U nor Y is in the same position as before. This satisfies every constraint.

So the next guess is “GULPY”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to see which letters are present in the secret word and potentially their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a big chunk of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should now pick a word built from the remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, Y, H, M, etc.  
A good candidate is “UNITY” – it uses five fresh, fairly common letters (U, N, I, T, Y) and avoids every letter already ruled out.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → all letters are NOT in the word (x).
2. UNITY → U and Y are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), while N, I, T are not in the word at all (x).

Letters we now know are in the word: U, Y  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T  

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, M, G, H, P, B, F, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both U and Y (in any positions except where they were in UNITY) and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

Possible word: “CLOUD” – but C, L, O, U, D: O is already ruled out.  
Another: “MUCKY” – M, U, C, K, Y: all letters are still allowed, and U and Y are placed in new positions.

So “MUCKY” is a valid next guess.

Current knowledge:

- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, M, C, K  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): U, Y  

We still need to place U and Y correctly while avoiding all eliminated letters.  
Remaining common letters to fill the other three slots: D, L, G, H, P, B, F, W, V, etc.

We want a 5-letter word containing both U and Y (each only once) and three fresh letters from the still-allowed set.  
Try to put U and Y in positions they did NOT occupy before:

- In UNITY: U was 1st, Y 5th → avoid 1st for U, 5th for Y.  
- In MUCKY: U was 2nd, Y 5th → avoid 2nd for U, 5th for Y.

So U could be 3rd or 4th, Y could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Candidate word: “FLUID” – but F, L, U, I, D: I is already ruled out.  
Another: “BUGGY” – repeats G and Y, and G is allowed, but double G is okay; however Y is 5th again, which we want to avoid.  
Better: “HUMPY” – H, U, M, P, Y: M is ruled out.  
Next: “GULPY” – G, U, L, P, Y: all letters are still allowed, and neither U nor Y is in the same position as before. This satisfies every constraint.

So the next guess is “GULPY”.

From the latest feedback:

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, M, C, K, G, L  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word (but in wrong positions): U, Y, P  

So the secret word must contain U, Y, and P exactly once each, and two other letters that have not been used or eliminated.

Positions to avoid for these known letters:
- U: cannot be 1st (UNITY), 2nd (MUCKY), 3rd (GULPY) → U must be 4th or 5th
- Y: cannot be 5th (UNITY, MUCKY, GULPY) → Y must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- P: cannot be 4th (GULPY) → P must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th

Still-allowed letters (common ones): D, H, B, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U, Y, P each once.
2. Uses two fresh letters from the allowed set.
3. Places U, Y, P only in allowed positions.

Let’s try:
- Put Y in 1st position (allowed).
- Put P in 2nd position (allowed).
- Put U in 4th position (allowed).
- Fill 3rd and 5th with fresh letters.

Candidate: Y P _ _ _  
We need two new letters. Let’s pick D and H (both still allowed).  
Word: Y P D H _ – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Try Y P D _ _: “YPD??” – invalid.  
Try Y P _ D _: “YP_D_” – invalid.  
Try Y _ P _ _: “Y_P__” – invalid.  
Try _ Y P _ _: “Y is 2nd, P is 3rd” – but Y must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd; P must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.  
Let’s try Y in 2nd, P in 5th: _ Y _ _ P  
U must be 4th: _ Y _ U P  
Fill 1st and 3rd with allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to see which letters are present in the secret word and potentially their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a big chunk of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should now pick a word built from the remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, Y, H, M, etc.  
A good candidate is “UNITY” – it uses five fresh, fairly common letters (U, N, I, T, Y) and avoids every letter already ruled out.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(x) T(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → all letters are NOT in the word (x).
2. UNITY → U and Y are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), while N, I, T are not in the word at all (x).

Letters we now know are in the word: U, Y  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T  

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, M, G, H, P, B, F, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both U and Y (in any positions except where they were in UNITY) and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

Possible word: “CLOUD” – but C, L, O, U, D: O is already ruled out.  
Another: “MUCKY” – M, U, C, K, Y: all letters are still allowed, and U and Y are placed in new positions.

So “MUCKY” is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(x) T(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: MUCKY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(-) C(x) K(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current knowledge:

- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, M, C, K  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): U, Y  

We still need to place U and Y correctly while avoiding all eliminated letters.  
Remaining common letters to fill the other three slots: D, L, G, H, P, B, F, W, V, etc.

We want a 5-letter word containing both U and Y (each only once) and three fresh letters from the still-allowed set.  
Try to put U and Y in positions they did NOT occupy before:

- In UNITY: U was 1st, Y 5th → avoid 1st for U, 5th for Y.  
- In MUCKY: U was 2nd, Y 5th → avoid 2nd for U, 5th for Y.

So U could be 3rd or 4th, Y could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Candidate word: “FLUID” – but F, L, U, I, D: I is already ruled out.  
Another: “BUGGY” – repeats G and Y, and G is allowed, but double G is okay; however Y is 5th again, which we want to avoid.  
Better: “HUMPY” – H, U, M, P, Y: M is ruled out.  
Next: “GULPY” – G, U, L, P, Y: all letters are still allowed, and neither U nor Y is in the same position as before. This satisfies every constraint.

So the next guess is “GULPY”.

From the latest feedback:

- G, L are NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Letters we know are in the word: U, P, Y  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, M, C, K, G, L  

Remaining common letters to fill the other two slots: D, H, B, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that contains U, P, Y (each only once) and two fresh letters from the still-allowed set.  
Positions to avoid:
- U cannot be 2nd or 3rd (from MUCKY and GULPY).
- P cannot be 4th.
- Y cannot be 5th.

Let’s try to place U, P, Y in valid positions and pick two new allowed letters.

One valid arrangement:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   Y P U D H  (but D and H are allowed)

Word: YPU DH – not valid.  
Need a real word.

Another arrangement:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D U P Y H – but Y is 5th, which is invalid.

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   H U P Y D – valid positions: U is 2nd (invalid).

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   B U P Y D – same issue with U in 2nd.

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   P U B Y D – U in 2nd again.

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D U B P Y – Y in 5th (invalid).

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D P U B Y – Y in 5th.

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   B P U D Y – Y in 5th.

Another:

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D U B P Y – Y in 5th.

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D U P B Y – Y in 5th.

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D U P Y B – Y in 4th (valid), P in 3rd (valid), U in 2nd (invalid).

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D P U Y B – Y in 4th (valid), P in 2nd (valid), U in 3rd (invalid).

Another:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   D P Y U B – Y in 3rd (valid), P in 2nd (valid), U in 4th (valid).

This gives the word D P Y U B → ""DYPUB"" – not a valid English word.
