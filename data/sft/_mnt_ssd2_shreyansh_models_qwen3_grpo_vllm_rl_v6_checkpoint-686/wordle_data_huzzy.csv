For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it tests S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word containing any of those five letters.

To maximize new information, we want a word that uses letters we haven’t tried yet and still covers common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good unused letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D have not been used yet.  
- It tests two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (R, N, D).

This should quickly narrow down vowel/consonant possibilities.

From all feedback so far:

2. ROUND → R, O, N, D are absent; U is present but not in position 3.
3. CHUMP → C, M, P are absent; H is present but not in position 2; U is present but not in position 3.

So the word must:
- Contain U and H.
- U is not in position 3.
- H is not in position 2.
- Exclude: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, D, C, M, P.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, F, G, I, K, Q, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses U and H (in allowed positions) and only the still-possible letters. A good candidate is “WHIFF”:
- W and F are new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it tests S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word containing any of those five letters.

To maximize new information, we want a word that uses letters we haven’t tried yet and still covers common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good unused letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D have not been used yet.  
- It tests two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (R, N, D).

This should quickly narrow down vowel/consonant possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- ROUND → R, O, N, D are absent, but U is present somewhere in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter U (but not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, D.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: C, G, H, I, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U (not in position 3).
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses a mix of consonants and vowels to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CHUMP”:
- C, H, M, P are new consonants.
- U is included and placed in position 2 (not position 3).
- All letters are still possible based on current feedback.

This should help us test new consonants and confirm the position of U.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it tests S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word containing any of those five letters.

To maximize new information, we want a word that uses letters we haven’t tried yet and still covers common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good unused letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D have not been used yet.  
- It tests two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (R, N, D).

This should quickly narrow down vowel/consonant possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- ROUND → R, O, N, D are absent, but U is present somewhere in the word.

- The word contains the letter U (but not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, D.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: C, G, H, I, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U (not in position 3).
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses a mix of consonants and vowels to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CHUMP”:
- C, H, M, P are new consonants.
- U is included and placed in position 2 (not position 3).
- All letters are still possible based on current feedback.

This should help us test new consonants and confirm the position of U.

3. CHUMP → C, M, P are absent; H is present but not in position 2; U is present but not in position 3.

- Contain U and H.
- U is not in position 3.
- H is not in position 2.
- Exclude: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, D, C, M, P.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, F, G, I, K, Q, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses U and H (in allowed positions) and only the still-possible letters. A good candidate is “WHIFF”:
- W and F are new letters.
- H is in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said H is not in position 2 of CHUMP, and we’re moving it).
- U is missing, so this word won’t test U’s position. Let’s try a word that includes both U and H.

Better: “BUGHY” (if valid) but “BUGHY” isn’t a recognized word. “BUGGY” is valid but repeats G. “FUGUE” has U and G but E is excluded. “HUMID” has M and D excluded. “QUICK” has Q, U, I, C, K; C excluded. “VIBGY” isn’t valid. 

A valid word: “FUGLY” (slang but acceptable). However, let’s pick a more common word: “FUGUE” uses U and G but E is excluded.

- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, D, C, M, P, G  
- Letters confirmed present: H (position 1), U (position 2), Y (position 5)  
- Positions fixed: H _ U _ Y  

Remaining letters to test must come from the unused pool: B, F, I, K, Q, V, W, etc.  
We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) drawn only from the still-allowed set.

A quick scan of 5-letter words matching the pattern H U _ _ Y gives:

- HUMID – M, D already excluded  
- HUGGY – already tried, G excluded  
- HULKY – L excluded  
- HUNTY – N excluded  
- HUDDY – D, D excluded  
- HUZZY – Z not yet excluded, but only one Z  
- HUBBY – B, B, Y; Y already fixed in position 5  
- HUSSY – S excluded  
- HUBBY – valid, uses B twice  

The simplest valid word that fits the pattern and only uses still-allowed letters is “HUBBY”.

Check:
- H (✓)  
- U (✓)  
- B (new)  
- B (new)  
- Y (✓)  

All letters are allowed, and we test B in both positions 3 and 4.

From all feedback:

- Positions locked: H(1) U(2) _ _ Y(5)
- Letters now known to be absent: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, D, C, M, P, G, B

So the third and fourth letters must come from the remaining unused alphabet: F, I, K, Q, V, W, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern H U _ _ Y:

- HUFIY – not valid
- HUVIY – not valid
- HUWXY – not valid
- HUQKY – not valid
- HUFIK – not valid
- HUQIK – not valid
- HUVIK – not valid
- HUFIK – not valid
- HUQIK – not valid

The only common English word that fits H U _ _ Y and uses letters not yet excluded is:

- HULKY – but L is excluded
- HUMID – M, D excluded
- HUNTY – N excluded
- HUDDY – D excluded
- HUGGY – G excluded
- HUBBY – B excluded
- HUSKY – S, K, Y; S excluded
- HUZZY – Z not yet excluded, but only one Z

Wait, let's check HUZZY:
- H(✓) U(✓) Z(x) Z(x) Y(✓)

Z hasn't been excluded yet, and this is a valid word. It tests Z in both positions 3 and 4.

No other common words fit. So HUZZY is the logical next guess.
