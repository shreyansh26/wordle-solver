For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct high-frequency letters

This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct high-frequency letters

This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E (but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or O.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, S, E (but moves them to new positions).
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A and O.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T (new letter)
- R (moved to position 2, allowed since feedback only said it’s not in position 2 of AROSE, and we’re testing a new position)
- I (new vowel)
- E (moved to position 4, allowed since it was not in position 5)
- S (moved to position 5, allowed since it was not in position 4)

However, we need to ensure R isn’t in position 2 again. Let’s try “STERN”:
- S (moved to position 1, allowed since it was not in position 4)
- T (new letter)
- E (moved to position 3, allowed since it was not in position 5)
- R (moved to position 4, allowed since it was not in position 2)
- N (new letter)

This tests new letters T and N while repositioning R, S, E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

   – R is not in positions 2 or 4  
   – S is not in positions 1 or 4  
   – E is not in positions 3 or 5  

2. Letters that are definitely out: A, O, T, N  

3. We still need to place R, S, E correctly and introduce new common consonants/vowels that haven’t been tried yet. Good untested letters include I, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

Aiming for a word that:
- uses R, S, E in fresh positions  
- adds one or two new high-frequency letters  
- avoids the ruled-out letters and positions  

One candidate is “CRISP”:
C (new), R (position 2 – allowed), I (new), S (position 4 – ruled out, so skip)  
→ S in position 4 is invalid, so discard.

Next candidate: “LURED”
L (new), U (new), R (position 3 – allowed), E (position 4 – allowed), D (new)  
→ uses R and E in new spots, introduces L, U, D.  
Checks all boxes.

Another candidate: “URGED”
U (new), R (position 2 – ruled out), so discard.

“LURED” looks solid: new letters L, U, D; R in position 3; E in position 4.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct high-frequency letters

This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E (but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or O.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, S, E (but moves them to new positions).
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A and O.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T (new letter)
- R (moved to position 2, allowed since feedback only said it’s not in position 2 of AROSE, and we’re testing a new position)
- I (new vowel)
- E (moved to position 4, allowed since it was not in position 5)
- S (moved to position 5, allowed since it was not in position 4)

However, we need to ensure R isn’t in position 2 again. Let’s try “STERN”:
- S (moved to position 1, allowed since it was not in position 4)
- T (new letter)
- E (moved to position 3, allowed since it was not in position 5)
- R (moved to position 4, allowed since it was not in position 2)
- N (new letter)

This tests new letters T and N while repositioning R, S, E.

Guess 2: STERN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are definitely in the word: R, S, E  
   – R is not in positions 2 or 4  
   – S is not in positions 1 or 4  
   – E is not in positions 3 or 5  

2. Letters that are definitely out: A, O, T, N  

3. We still need to place R, S, E correctly and introduce new common consonants/vowels that haven’t been tried yet. Good untested letters include I, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

Aiming for a word that:
- uses R, S, E in fresh positions  
- adds one or two new high-frequency letters  
- avoids the ruled-out letters and positions  

One candidate is “CRISP”:
C (new), R (position 2 – allowed), I (new), S (position 4 – ruled out, so skip)  
→ S in position 4 is invalid, so discard.

Next candidate: “LURED”
L (new), U (new), R (position 3 – allowed), E (position 4 – allowed), D (new)  
→ uses R and E in new spots, introduces L, U, D.  
Checks all boxes.

Another candidate: “URGED”
U (new), R (position 2 – ruled out), so discard.

“LURED” looks solid: new letters L, U, D; R in position 3; E in position 4.

Guess 3: LURED -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on LURED:
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, E (with E fixed at position 4).
- Letters out: A, O, T, N, L, U, D.
- Positions ruled out:
  – R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.
  – E is already fixed in position 4.

Remaining common letters to test: I, C, Y, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.

We need to place R and S in the remaining open positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their restrictions, and fill the remaining slots with new letters.

Possible positions:
- E is at 4.
- R can be at 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4).
- S can be at 2 or 5 (cannot be 1,3,4).

Let’s try a word that:
- Puts R at position 1 (allowed).
- Puts S at position 2 (allowed).
- Fills positions 3 and 5 with new letters.

Candidate: “RESIN”
- R at 1 (allowed).
- E at 4 (correct).
- S at 2 (allowed).
- I and N: N was already ruled out in STERN, so skip N. I is new.

Next candidate: “REINS” – but N is out.

Next: “REBID” – D is out.

Next: “REBUT” – U and T are out.

Next: “REHAB” – H, A, B: A is out.

Next: “RECIT” – T is out.

Next: “RECKS” – K and S: S is already known, but let’s check positions:
- R at 1, E at 4, C at 2, K at 3, S at 5.
Positions: R(1) – allowed, S(5) – allowed, E(4) – correct.
Letters: C and K are new (not yet tested), S is known, R is known.

This looks good.
