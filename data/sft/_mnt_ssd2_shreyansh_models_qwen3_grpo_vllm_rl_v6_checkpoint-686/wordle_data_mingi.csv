For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common letter overall

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter N (but not in position 4).  
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters.  
3. Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common letter overall

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we must avoid those letters entirely in our next guess.  
To maximize information, we still want a word with common remaining letters, including vowels and high-frequency consonants.  
Good consonants left: R, N, M, C, D, P, B, G, H, K  
Good vowels left: I, O, U  

A balanced starter that uses none of S, L, A, T, E is “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y  
- C and R are very common consonants  
- O is a common vowel  
- N and Y cover additional useful letters

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because CRONY gave N(-) in slot 4).

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter N (but not in position 4).  
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters.  
3. Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- DINGY – uses D, I, N, G, Y (but Y is eliminated)  
- BINGO – uses B, I, N, G, O (O is eliminated)  
- PINKY – P, I, N, K, Y (Y eliminated)  
- HUMPY – H, U, M, P, Y (Y eliminated)  

A valid choice is “MINKY” but Y is out.  
Instead, “MINKS” has S out.  
Next, “MUNCH” – C out.  
“PUNCH” – C out.  
“DUMPY” – Y out.  

A clean candidate is “DUMPN” but that’s not a word.  
“PUNGI” – G, I, N, P, U (all letters allowed and N not in slot 4).  

Let’s pick “PUNGI”:
- P, U, N, G, I – none of S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- N is in position 3 (not 4) so it satisfies N(-) from CRONY.  
- Covers new letters P, U, G, I.

Good consonants left: R, N, M, C, D, P, B, G, H, K  
Good vowels left: I, O, U  

A balanced starter that uses none of S, L, A, T, E is “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y  
- C and R are very common consonants  
- O is a common vowel  
- N and Y cover additional useful letters  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, E) are used

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because CRONY gave N(-) in slot 4).

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter N (but not in position 4).  
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters.  
3. Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- DINGY – uses D, I, N, G, Y (but Y is eliminated)  
- BINGO – uses B, I, N, G, O (O is eliminated)  
- PINKY – P, I, N, K, Y (Y eliminated)  
- HUMPY – H, U, M, P, Y (Y eliminated)  

A valid choice is “MINKY” but Y is out.  
Instead, “MINKS” has S out.  
Next, “MUNCH” – C out.  
“PUNCH” – C out.  
“DUMPY” – Y out.  

A clean candidate is “DUMPN” but that’s not a word.  
“PUNGI” – G, I, N, P, U (all letters allowed and N not in slot 4).  

Let’s pick “PUNGI”:
- P, U, N, G, I – none of S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- N is in position 3 (not 4) so it satisfies N(-) from CRONY.  
- Covers new letters P, U, G, I.

From the new feedback on PUNGI:

- P(x)  – P is not in the word.
- U(x)  – U is not in the word.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct position (slot 3).
- G(✓) – G is in the word and in the correct position (slot 4).
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (slot 5).

So we now know the exact pattern:
_ _ N G I

Letters already eliminated (from all guesses):
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, P, U

Remaining unused common letters (for slots 1 and 2):
B, D, F, H, K, M, V, W, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends in N G I and uses only allowed letters in the first two slots.

Possible endings: ...NGI

Looking at valid English words ending in NGI:
- BINGI – not a standard word
- DINGI – not standard
- FINGI – not standard
- HINGI – not standard
- KINGI – valid (variant of king, used in some contexts)
- MINGI – not standard
- WINGI – not standard
- ZINGI – not standard

The only plausible candidate from this list is “KINGI”.

Let’s verify:
- K, I, N, G, I
- I and N are already confirmed in their positions
- K is not in the eliminated set
- All letters comply with prior feedback

Hence, the logical next guess is KINGI.

We now have the pattern _ I N G I and know:

- Slot 1: cannot be K (from KINGI feedback) or any previously eliminated letter (S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, P, U, K).
- Allowed remaining first letters: B, D, F, H, M, V, W, Z (and possibly others not yet used).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in slot 2, N in slot 3, G in slot 4, I in slot 5.
2. Uses only allowed letters in slot 1.

The structure is: ? I N G I

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- BINGI – not standard
- DINGI – not standard
- FINGI – not standard
- HINGI – not standard
- MINGI – not standard
- WINGI – not standard
- ZINGI – not standard

However, ""WINDI"" does not fit the pattern. Rechecking, the only valid word seems to be ""DINGI"" or ""BINGI"", but these aren't standard. 

Upon deeper thought, ""WINDI"" is invalid. The correct approach is to realize that ""DINGI"" is a valid variant (a type of boat), but may not be in common dictionaries. 

A more common word fitting _ I N G I is ""FINGI"" – but again, not standard. 

Re-evaluating, the only plausible standard word is ""DINGI"" (a variant of dinghy). Since it's the only remaining candidate, we'll proceed with it, noting it's a less common term.

But wait – let's double-check standard dictionaries. The standard word ending in N G I is actually ""SINGI"" – but S is eliminated. 

Realizing this, the next possible is ""M I N G I"" – but ""MINGI"" isn't standard. 

Upon reflection, the correct standard word fitting _ I N G I is ""DINGI"" (as listed in some dictionaries as a boat type). 

Thus, the guess is DINGI, using D in slot 1, which hasn't been eliminated.
