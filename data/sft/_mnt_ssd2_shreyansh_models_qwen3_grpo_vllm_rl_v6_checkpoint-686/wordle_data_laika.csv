### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good positional coverage of common letters

This gives us a broad baseline to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S, E
- Letter to include somewhere else: A (but not in position 1)

Good next letters to test are common consonants and vowels not yet tried, such as T, N, I, L, U, C, D, etc. A word that uses A in a different position and introduces several new common letters is ideal. ""TAUNT"" uses:
- A in position 2 (different from position 1)
- T, U, N (all new and common)
- No excluded letters (R,O,S,E)

Current constraints:

We need to test new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

A word that uses several of these while fitting _ A _ _ _ is “BACON”, but O is already excluded. “BADLY” uses B, D, L, Y – all new and common. Let’s try BADLY.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good positional coverage of common letters

This gives us a broad baseline to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S, E
- Letter to include somewhere else: A (but not in position 1)

Good next letters to test are common consonants and vowels not yet tried, such as T, N, I, L, U, C, D, etc. A word that uses A in a different position and introduces several new common letters is ideal. ""TAUNT"" uses:
- A in position 2 (different from position 1)
- T, U, N (all new and common)
- No excluded letters (R,O,S,E)

This should give us good information about T, U, N and the correct placement of A.

Guess 2: TAUNT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- A is in the word and must be in position 2 (from TAUNT feedback: A(✓)).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, U, N.

So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with the remaining letters drawn from {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

We need to test new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

A word that uses several of these while fitting _ A _ _ _ is “BACON”, but O is already excluded. “BADLY” uses B, D, L, Y – all new and common. Let’s try BADLY.

Pattern: B A D L Y
- B: new
- A: fixed in position 2
- D: new
- L: new
- Y: new

This tests four new letters in one guess.

- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: L (from BADLY feedback: L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 4)

So we need:
- A in position 2
- L somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5)
- Remaining letters must be from the unused pool: {C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}

Let’s try to place L in position 1 and pick three new common consonants/vowels. A good candidate is “CLAMP”:
- C: new
- L: new, placed in position 1
- A: fixed in position 2
- M: new
- P: new

This tests L in position 1 and introduces C, M, P.

From all feedback so far:

   – T, U, N are excluded.

3. BADLY → B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(-) Y(x)  
   – A still in position 2 (consistent).  
   – B, D, Y are excluded.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 4.

4. CLAMP → C(x) L(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)

   – L is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with previous info).  
   – C, M, P are excluded.

Current constraints:
- Word must be of the form _ A _ _ _
- Letters that are **in** the word: A (position 2), L
- Letters that are **excluded**: R, O, S, E, T, U, N, B, D, Y, C, M, P
- Therefore, L must occupy one of positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 4, and cannot be 1 or 2).

The remaining usable letters (from the alphabet excluding all excluded ones) are:
{F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}

We need a 5-letter word _ A _ _ _ that contains L somewhere in positions 3 or 5 and only uses the remaining letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 3 = L → _ A L _ _
- Position 5 = L → _ A _ _ L

Looking at common English words:
- _ A L _ _: “HALAL” – but L is repeated and A is already in position 2.  
- _ A _ _ L: “VALOR” – contains excluded letters.  
- “FATAL” – contains excluded T.  
- “GALAX” – X is uncommon but valid; let’s check: G, A, L, A, X. A is already in position 2, so second A would be in position 4 – but A is already fixed in position 2 and no restriction prevents it from appearing again. However, we have no evidence of double letters yet.

But “GALAX” uses X which is allowed and fits _ A L _ _ with L in position 3.

Another simple word: “FATAL” – but T is excluded.

“KALIX” – K, A, L, I, X: all letters allowed, L in position 3.

Let’s pick “KALIX”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Let’s summarize the constraints after five guesses.

1. Position 2 is A (✓).
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from feedback: L(-) in guesses 3, 4, and 5).  
   Therefore L must be in position 1.
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from KALIX feedback: I(-)).
4. X is NOT in the word (from KALIX feedback).
5. Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, E, T, U, N, B, D, Y, C, M, P, X.

Current pattern: L A _ _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding all excluded ones):  
F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, Z

We also know:
- I is in the word, and cannot be in position 4.  
  So I must be in position 3 or 5.

Thus the word must be one of:
L A I _ _  or  L A _ I _

Looking at the remaining letters, let’s try to form common 5-letter words:

- L A I _ _ : “LAIGE” – but E is excluded.  
- L A _ I _ : “LAVIC” – C is excluded.  
- L A _ I _ : “LAWNY” – N, Y excluded.  
- L A _ I _ : “LAZIL” – Z, L allowed but double L?  
- L A _ I _ : “LAVID” – D excluded.

Wait, let’s list the remaining letters again: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, Z, plus I.

We need two more letters from these, with I somewhere in positions 3 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- L A I _ _ : “LAIGE” (invalid, E excluded), “LAIRD” (R, D excluded).  
- L A _ I _ : “LAVIC” (C excluded), “LAWED” (W allowed, E, D excluded), “LAZIL” (double L, but L is allowed).  
- L A _ _ I : “LAVID” (D excluded), “LAVAI” (A repeated, but allowed).

The only remaining common-sounding word is “LAVID”, but D is excluded.  
“LAZIL” uses only allowed letters: L, A, Z, I, L. It fits L A _ _ I with I in position 5.

Therefore, the next logical guess is LAZIL.
