For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: COBIS  
C(x) O(-) B(x) I(x) S(✓)

1. Position 3 must be O (from Guess 1’s O✓).  
2. S must appear somewhere in the word, and from Guess 2 we now know it is in position 5 (S✓).  
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, E, C, B, I.  
4. Therefore the word has the pattern: _ _ O _ S.

We still need three more letters (positions 1, 2, and 4) chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the six eliminated letters. Common remaining consonants and vowels include D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words ending in “O_S” that use only allowed letters gives “DOUGH” (but H is allowed and G is allowed). However, “DOUGH” has U, which we haven’t tested yet. Another candidate is “FOGUS” (but F and U are allowed). A simpler, more common word is “DOORS” (but R is eliminated). Another candidate is “HOOPS” (but P and H are allowed). 

A safe, common word that fits: “DOUGH” (D-O-U-G-H), but position 3 must be O, so it’s D-O-U-G-H → that would place O in position 2, which conflicts. 

Wait, pattern is _ _ O _ S. So we need a word like: X Y O Z S.

Let’s think of common words:  
- DOZES (but Z is allowed, E is eliminated)  
- MOONS (but N is allowed, M is allowed)  
- FOOTS (but T is allowed)  
- HOOPS (H, O, O, P, S) – but O is already in position 3, and we have double O. Is that allowed? Yes, letters can repeat.  

“HOOPS” fits:  
- H, O, O, P, S  
- O is in position 3 (correct)  
- S is in position 5 (correct)  
- Letters used: H, O, P – none of A, R, E, C, B, I.  

Another candidate is “MOONS”:  
- M, O, O, N, S  
- Also fits perfectly.  

Between HOOPS and MOONS, both are valid. I’ll go with MOONS because M is a common starting letter.

So the next guess is MOONS.

Let’s extract every constraint from the three guesses.

1. Position 3 is definitely O (from AROSE’s O✓).
2. S is definitely in position 5 (from MOONS’s S✓).
3. Therefore the pattern is: _ _ O _ S
4. Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, E, C, B, I, M, N
5. Letters we know ARE in the word:
   O (position 3), S (position 5)
6. We still need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 8 letters above). Remaining common consonants/vowels include D, F, G, H, L, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Quick scan of valid _ _ O _ S words avoiding the banned letters:

- DOZES – Z is allowed, but E is banned.
- FOGUS – U is allowed, but G is allowed; fits: F O G U S → but position 4 would be G, position 2 is G, which is fine.
- HOGUS – same issue with H, O, G, U, S: H O G U S → O is in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3. So this is invalid.
- JOKUS – J, O, K, U, S: O is in position 2 → invalid.
- KOGUS – same problem.
- POGUS – same problem.
- TOGUS – same problem.
- YOGUS – same problem.
- DOGUS – D, O, G, U, S → O is in position 2 → invalid.

We need words with O strictly in position 3 and S in position 5.

Valid candidates:
- DOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- FOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- HOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- JOKUS – invalid (O in 2)
- KOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- POGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- TOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- YOGUS – invalid (O in 2)

Wait, we missed that the pattern is _ _ O _ S, so we need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any allowed letter
- Position 5: S

Common words fitting _ _ O _ S with allowed letters:
- DOGOS – but O repeats, and O is already in position 3.
- DOLOS – L is allowed, D is allowed.
- FOGOS – F, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- HOGOS – same.
- JOKOS – J, O, K, O, S → O repeats.
- KOGOS – same.
- POGOS – same.
- TOGOS – same.
- YOGOS – same.

Another approach: look for words with O in position 3 and S in position 5, avoiding banned letters.

Examples:
- DOLOS – D, O, L, O, S → O repeats, but allowed.
- FOGOS – F, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- HOGOS – H, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- JOKOS – J, O, K, O, S → O repeats.
- KOGOS – K, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- POGOS – P, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- TOGOS – T, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- YOGOS – Y, O, G, O, S → O repeats.

None of these are ideal because they repeat O. Let’s try without repeating O.

Words with O in position 3 and S in position 5, no repeats:
- D, O, L, U, S → D O L U S → but position 4 is L, position 2 is L, so D O L U S → O is in 2 → invalid.
- D, O, G, U, S → D O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- F, O, G, U, S → F O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- H, O, G, U, S → H O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- K, O, G, U, S → K O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- P, O, G, U, S → P O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- T, O, G, U, S → T O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- Y, O, G, U, S → Y O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.

This suggests most common _ _ O _ S words have O in position 2. Let’s try a different set of letters.

We need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (D, F, G, H, L, P, T, U, Y, etc.)
- Position 2: any allowed letter (same set)
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any allowed letter (same set)
- Position 5: S

Let’s list possible combinations:

- D, F, O, G, S → DFOGS – not a word.
- D, L, O, G, S → DLOGS – not a word.
- F, L, O, G, S → FLOGS – valid word (past tense of ""fling"" or ""flog"").
- H, L, O, G, S → HLOGS – not a word.
- P, L, O, G, S → PLOGS – valid word.
- T, L, O, G, S → TLOGS – not a word.
- Y, L, O, G, S → YLOGS – not a word.

Between FLOGS and PLOGS, both are valid. I’ll choose FLOGS.

F, L, O, G, S:
- F: allowed (not in banned list)
- L: allowed
- O: correct position 3
- G: allowed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 3rd position
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, E

Possible words:
- POSIT (but has A in position 3, which is wrong)
- COBIS (but has B and I which might be good)
- DOSING (but has 6 letters)
- COBOS (but has B and O again)

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- COBOS (but O is in position 3, and has S in position 5, which is allowed)
- POSIT (but A is not in word, so P-O-S-I-T is possible)
- COGYS (but Y is uncommon)
- COBIS (C-O-B-I-S, O in 3, S in 5, no A/R/E)

COBIS seems good as it introduces new letters (B, I) while fitting the constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: COBIS  
C(x) O(-) B(x) I(x) S(✓)

1. Position 3 must be O (from Guess 1’s O✓).  
2. S must appear somewhere in the word, and from Guess 2 we now know it is in position 5 (S✓).  
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, E, C, B, I.  
4. Therefore the word has the pattern: _ _ O _ S.

We still need three more letters (positions 1, 2, and 4) chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the six eliminated letters. Common remaining consonants and vowels include D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words ending in “O_S” that use only allowed letters gives “DOUGH” (but H is allowed and G is allowed). However, “DOUGH” has U, which we haven’t tested yet. Another candidate is “FOGUS” (but F and U are allowed). A simpler, more common word is “DOORS” (but R is eliminated). Another candidate is “HOOPS” (but P and H are allowed). 

A safe, common word that fits: “DOUGH” (D-O-U-G-H), but position 3 must be O, so it’s D-O-U-G-H → that would place O in position 2, which conflicts. 

Wait, pattern is _ _ O _ S. So we need a word like: X Y O Z S.

Let’s think of common words:  
- DOZES (but Z is allowed, E is eliminated)  
- MOONS (but N is allowed, M is allowed)  
- FOOTS (but T is allowed)  
- HOOPS (H, O, O, P, S) – but O is already in position 3, and we have double O. Is that allowed? Yes, letters can repeat.  

“HOOPS” fits:  
- H, O, O, P, S  
- O is in position 3 (correct)  
- S is in position 5 (correct)  
- Letters used: H, O, P – none of A, R, E, C, B, I.  

Another candidate is “MOONS”:  
- M, O, O, N, S  
- Also fits perfectly.  

Between HOOPS and MOONS, both are valid. I’ll go with MOONS because M is a common starting letter.

So the next guess is MOONS.

- DOZES – Z is allowed, but E is banned.
- FOGUS – U is allowed, but G is allowed; fits: F O G U S → but position 4 would be G, position 2 is G, which is fine.
- HOGUS – same issue with H, O, G, U, S: H O G U S → O is in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3. So this is invalid.

- KOGUS – same problem.
- POGUS – same problem.
- TOGUS – same problem.
- YOGUS – same problem.
- DOGUS – D, O, G, U, S → O is in position 2 → invalid.

- KOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- POGUS – invalid (O in 2)

- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 3: O

Common words fitting _ _ O _ S with allowed letters:

- POGOS – P, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- TOGOS – T, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- YOGOS – Y, O, G, O, S → O repeats.

None of these are ideal because they repeat O. Let’s try without repeating O.

Words with O in position 3 and S in position 5, no repeats:
- D, O, L, U, S → D O L U S → but position 4 is L, position 2 is L, so D O L U S → O is in 2 → invalid.

This suggests most common _ _ O _ S words have O in position 2. Let’s try a different set of letters.

We need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (D, F, G, H, L, P, T, U, Y, etc.)
- Position 2: any allowed letter (same set)
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any allowed letter (same set)
- Position 5: S

Let’s list possible combinations:

- D, F, O, G, S → DFOGS – not a word.
- D, L, O, G, S → DLOGS – not a word.
- F, L, O, G, S → FLOGS – valid word (past tense of ""fling"" or ""flog"").
- H, L, O, G, S → HLOGS – not a word.
- P, L, O, G, S → PLOGS – valid word.
- T, L, O, G, S → TLOGS – not a word.
- Y, L, O, G, S → YLOGS – not a word.

Between FLOGS and PLOGS, both are valid. I’ll choose FLOGS.

F, L, O, G, S:
- F: allowed (not in banned list)
- L: allowed
- O: correct position 3
- G: allowed
- S: correct position 5
- No banned letters used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 3rd position
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, E

Possible words:
- POSIT (but has A in position 3, which is wrong)
- COBIS (but has B and I which might be good)
- DOSING (but has 6 letters)
- COBOS (but has B and O again)

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- COBOS (but O is in position 3, and has S in position 5, which is allowed)
- POSIT (but A is not in word, so P-O-S-I-T is possible)
- COGYS (but Y is uncommon)
- COBIS (C-O-B-I-S, O in 3, S in 5, no A/R/E)

COBIS seems good as it introduces new letters (B, I) while fitting the constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: COBIS  
C(x) O(-) B(x) I(x) S(✓)

1. Position 3 must be O (from Guess 1’s O✓).  
2. S must appear somewhere in the word, and from Guess 2 we now know it is in position 5 (S✓).  
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, E, C, B, I.  
4. Therefore the word has the pattern: _ _ O _ S.

We still need three more letters (positions 1, 2, and 4) chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the six eliminated letters. Common remaining consonants and vowels include D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words ending in “O_S” that use only allowed letters gives “DOUGH” (but H is allowed and G is allowed). However, “DOUGH” has U, which we haven’t tested yet. Another candidate is “FOGUS” (but F and U are allowed). A simpler, more common word is “DOORS” (but R is eliminated). Another candidate is “HOOPS” (but P and H are allowed). 

A safe, common word that fits: “DOUGH” (D-O-U-G-H), but position 3 must be O, so it’s D-O-U-G-H → that would place O in position 2, which conflicts. 

Wait, pattern is _ _ O _ S. So we need a word like: X Y O Z S.

Let’s think of common words:  
- DOZES (but Z is allowed, E is eliminated)  
- MOONS (but N is allowed, M is allowed)  
- FOOTS (but T is allowed)  
- HOOPS (H, O, O, P, S) – but O is already in position 3, and we have double O. Is that allowed? Yes, letters can repeat.  

“HOOPS” fits:  
- H, O, O, P, S  
- O is in position 3 (correct)  
- S is in position 5 (correct)  
- Letters used: H, O, P – none of A, R, E, C, B, I.  

Another candidate is “MOONS”:  
- M, O, O, N, S  
- Also fits perfectly.  

Between HOOPS and MOONS, both are valid. I’ll go with MOONS because M is a common starting letter.

So the next guess is MOONS.

Let’s extract every constraint from the three guesses.

1. Position 3 is definitely O (from AROSE’s O✓).
2. S is definitely in position 5 (from MOONS’s S✓).
3. Therefore the pattern is: _ _ O _ S
4. Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, E, C, B, I, M, N
5. Letters we know ARE in the word:
   O (position 3), S (position 5)
6. We still need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 8 letters above). Remaining common consonants/vowels include D, F, G, H, L, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Quick scan of valid _ _ O _ S words avoiding the banned letters:

- DOZES – Z is allowed, but E is banned.
- FOGUS – U is allowed, but G is allowed; fits: F O G U S → but position 4 would be G, position 2 is G, which is fine.
- HOGUS – same issue with H, O, G, U, S: H O G U S → O is in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3. So this is invalid.
- JOKUS – J, O, K, U, S: O is in position 2 → invalid.
- KOGUS – same problem.
- POGUS – same problem.
- TOGUS – same problem.
- YOGUS – same problem.
- DOGUS – D, O, G, U, S → O is in position 2 → invalid.

We need words with O strictly in position 3 and S in position 5.

Valid candidates:
- DOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- FOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- HOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- JOKUS – invalid (O in 2)
- KOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- POGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- TOGUS – invalid (O in 2)
- YOGUS – invalid (O in 2)

Wait, we missed that the pattern is _ _ O _ S, so we need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any allowed letter
- Position 5: S

Common words fitting _ _ O _ S with allowed letters:
- DOGOS – but O repeats, and O is already in position 3.
- DOLOS – L is allowed, D is allowed.
- FOGOS – F, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- HOGOS – same.
- JOKOS – J, O, K, O, S → O repeats.
- KOGOS – same.
- POGOS – same.
- TOGOS – same.
- YOGOS – same.

Another approach: look for words with O in position 3 and S in position 5, avoiding banned letters.

Examples:
- DOLOS – D, O, L, O, S → O repeats, but allowed.
- FOGOS – F, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- HOGOS – H, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- JOKOS – J, O, K, O, S → O repeats.
- KOGOS – K, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- POGOS – P, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- TOGOS – T, O, G, O, S → O repeats.
- YOGOS – Y, O, G, O, S → O repeats.

None of these are ideal because they repeat O. Let’s try without repeating O.

Words with O in position 3 and S in position 5, no repeats:
- D, O, L, U, S → D O L U S → but position 4 is L, position 2 is L, so D O L U S → O is in 2 → invalid.
- D, O, G, U, S → D O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- F, O, G, U, S → F O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- H, O, G, U, S → H O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- K, O, G, U, S → K O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- P, O, G, U, S → P O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- T, O, G, U, S → T O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.
- Y, O, G, U, S → Y O G U S → O in 2 → invalid.

This suggests most common _ _ O _ S words have O in position 2. Let’s try a different set of letters.

We need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (D, F, G, H, L, P, T, U, Y, etc.)
- Position 2: any allowed letter (same set)
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any allowed letter (same set)
- Position 5: S

- D, L, O, G, S → DLOGS – not a word.
- F, L, O, G, S → FLOGS – valid word (past tense of ""fling"" or ""flog"").

- T, L, O, G, S → TLOGS – not a word.
- Y, L, O, G, S → YLOGS – not a word.

Between FLOGS and PLOGS, both are valid. I’ll choose FLOGS.

F, L, O, G, S:
- F: allowed (not in banned list)
- L: allowed
- O: correct position 3
- G: allowed
- S: correct position 5
- No banned letters used.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From all feedback so far we know:

1. The word has the fixed pattern _ _ O _ S.
2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   A, R, E, C, B, I, M, N, F, L, G
3. Therefore the remaining pool of allowed letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 is:
   D, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form X Y O Z S, using only the allowed letters.

Quick scan of common words with O in position 3 and S in position 5:
- DOZES – E is banned.
- HOOPS – P is allowed, O repeats (but allowed), H is allowed.
- JOKES – E is banned.
- KOLOS – L is banned.
- POOSS – P, O, O, S, S – O and S repeat, but allowed.
- TOXIC – C is banned.
- YOGIS – I is banned.
- ZOOMS – Z, O, O, M, S – M is banned.
- HOOOS – H, O, O, O, S – O repeats, but allowed.

Among these, **HOOPS** is a common English word, uses only allowed letters (H, O, P, S), and fits the pattern perfectly.

Let’s go with HOOPS.
