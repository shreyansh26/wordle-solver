For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let me try a word like ""RADIO"":
- R: common consonant
- A: known to be in word (position 2)
- D: common consonant
- I: common vowel
- O: common vowel

This tests new letters while placing A in a different position (2 instead of 3).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let me try a word like ""RADIO"":
- R: common consonant
- A: known to be in word (position 2)
- D: common consonant
- I: common vowel
- O: common vowel

This tests new letters while placing A in a different position (2 instead of 3).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x)  
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - R, D, O are not in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O.  
Letters we know ARE in the word: A (fixed at position 2), I (somewhere except position 4).

Remaining common letters to test: N, C, M, B, F, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- I somewhere except position 4.
- No S, L, T, E, R, D, O.

Possible patterns: _ A _ _ _  
I can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s try a word like “CAIMAN”:
- C: new consonant
- A: fixed in position 2
- I: in position 3 (allowed)
- M: new consonant
- A: but we already have A in position 2, and the word can only have one A (since letters are typically unique in Wordle answers unless specified otherwise). So “CAIMAN” is invalid because it repeats A.

Next try “BAKING”:
- B: new
- A: position 2 ✓
- K: new
- I: position 4 → but I cannot be in position 4 (from RADIO feedback). So invalid.

Next try “FAIRY”:
- F: new
- A: position 2 ✓
- I: position 3 (allowed)
- R: but R is excluded from the word (from RADIO feedback). So invalid.

Next try “GAMBI”:
- G: new
- A: position 2 ✓
- M: new
- B: new
- I: position 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters used. This seems valid.

However, “GAMBI” is not a common English word. Let’s pick a more common one.

Next try “HABIT”:
- H: new
- A: position 2 ✓
- B: new
- I: position 4 → but I cannot be in position 4. Invalid.

Next try “MACHO”:

- N: but N repeated and position 4 allowed, but we have _ A _ _ _ and N in position 4 is fine, but N in position 3 would be fine. However, “CANNY” has N in positions 3 and 4, which is acceptable. Also, Y is new. No excluded letters. This seems valid.

But “CANNY” has I not present, but we know I must be in the word. So invalid.

Next try “PAIN” too short.

Next try “CAIMAN” invalid due to double A.

So we now know:

- M is in position 1.
- A is in position 2.
- N is in position 3.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- C is not in the word.

Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, C.

Current known pattern: M A N _ _

I must appear in either position 5 (since it can’t be in 4 and positions 1-3 are taken).

So the word is M A N _ I.

The only common 5-letter word that fits is M A N G I (but G not yet tested) or M A N N I (invalid double N), or M A N G I, M A N K I, etc.

Looking at remaining common letters not yet excluded: B, F, G, H, K, P, U, Y.

Possible candidates:
- MANGI (valid word, but less common)
- MANKI (valid, but uncommon)
- MANAI (not a word)
- MANBI (not a word)
- MANGY (G and Y are new, but Y is at end, not sure)
- MANFI (not a word)

The most common valid word here is MANGI, but let me double-check:

Actually, MANGY is a word meaning ""furry with long, matted hair"". It fits M A N G Y, but we need I in position 5.

Wait, the pattern is M A N _ I.

So the only common word is M A N G I (as in MANGI, a type of grass or a word in some languages), but in English, MANGI is valid.

However, let me think of more common English words:

- MANGI is valid but rare.
- MANIK (not a word)
- MANIA (but A is already in position 2, and MANIA would have A in position 4, which is allowed since we only know I is not in position 4, not other letters)
- But MANIA has A in position 4, which is allowed.

Wait, let me check:

From earlier:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- I is somewhere except position 4.
- M, A, N are fixed in positions 1, 2, 3.

So the word is M A N _ _, with I somewhere in positions 4 or 5, but not 4 (from feedback I(-) in position 4 in MANIC), so I must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be M A N _ I.

The only common English word fitting this is M A N G I (as MANGI is listed in dictionaries as a variant spelling of MANGY or a grass type).

But let me think again - is there another?

- M A N K I (not common)
- M A N B I (not a word)
- M A N F I (not a word)
- M A N H I (not a word)
- M A N P I (not a word)
- M A N U I (not a word)
- M A N Y I (not a word)

Thus, the only valid candidate is MANGI.

But let me verify:

Yes, MANGI is recognized as a 5-letter English word (variant of MANGY or referring to a type of grass).

Therefore, the next guess should be MANGI.
