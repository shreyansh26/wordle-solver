For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better vowel coverage.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O
- Letters we must use somewhere: A, S, E
- Positions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, S≠4, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (each at least once).
2. Does NOT contain R or O.
3. Places A, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Let’s try a word that moves those known letters to new positions and fills the remaining spots with other common consonants. A good candidate is “SEATS”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1).
- T and the second S are new letters; T is common and the second S is acceptable.

This should give us useful information about the remaining letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SEATS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) E(✓) A(✓) T(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SEATS:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t in 4).
- E(✓): E is in the word AND in position 2.
- A(✓): A is in the word AND in position 3.
- T(x): T is NOT in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know the exact positions of three letters:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: S

We also know we must not use R, O, T.

Letters left to place: positions 1 and 4. We need two consonants (or maybe Y) that haven’t been ruled out yet. Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of 5-letter words that fit the pattern: _ E A _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BEADS (but D is okay, but we already know S is at 5, so this would be _ E A D S – but we don’t know about D yet)
- LEANS (but N is okay, and L is okay)
- PEANS (P is okay)
- HEARS (but R is banned)
- BEACH (but C is okay, and H is okay, but this would be _ E A C H – doesn’t end with S)
- FEARS (R banned)
- MEANS (M, N okay)
- WEASEL (but L is okay, but this is 6 letters)
- YEAST (but T banned)

Looking at _ E A _ S, possible words:
- BEADS – fits: B E A D S, but D hasn’t been tested yet.
- LEADS – fits: L E A D S, but D hasn’t been tested.
- PEADS – not a valid word.
- MEADS – not a valid word.
- HEAPS – but P is okay, H is okay: H E A P S.

HEAPS seems valid and uses new letters H and P, both of which haven’t been ruled out.

So I’ll guess HEAPS.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O
- Letters we must use somewhere: A, S, E
- Positions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, S≠4, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (each at least once).
2. Does NOT contain R or O.
3. Places A, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Let’s try a word that moves those known letters to new positions and fills the remaining spots with other common consonants. A good candidate is “SEATS”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1).
- T and the second S are new letters; T is common and the second S is acceptable.

This should give us useful information about the remaining letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SEATS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) E(✓) A(✓) T(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SEATS:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t in 4).
- E(✓): E is in the word AND in position 2.
- A(✓): A is in the word AND in position 3.
- T(x): T is NOT in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know the exact positions of three letters:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: S

We also know we must not use R, O, T.

Letters left to place: positions 1 and 4. We need two consonants (or maybe Y) that haven’t been ruled out yet. Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of 5-letter words that fit the pattern: _ E A _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BEADS (but D is okay, but we already know S is at 5, so this would be _ E A D S – but we don’t know about D yet)
- LEANS (but N is okay, and L is okay)
- PEANS (P is okay)
- HEARS (but R is banned)
- BEACH (but C is okay, and H is okay, but this would be _ E A C H – doesn’t end with S)
- FEARS (R banned)
- MEANS (M, N okay)
- WEASEL (but L is okay, but this is 6 letters)
- YEAST (but T banned)

Looking at _ E A _ S, possible words:
- BEADS – fits: B E A D S, but D hasn’t been tested yet.
- LEADS – fits: L E A D S, but D hasn’t been tested.
- PEADS – not a valid word.
- MEADS – not a valid word.
- HEAPS – but P is okay, H is okay: H E A P S.

HEAPS seems valid and uses new letters H and P, both of which haven’t been ruled out.

So I’ll guess HEAPS.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ E A _ S (positions 2,3,5 are locked)
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, T, H, P
- Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: any consonant or Y not yet excluded, excluding the banned ones.

Common unused consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters for spots 1 and 4. Let’s list valid English words fitting _ E A _ S with no banned letters:

Possible candidates:
- BEADS  (B and D – both allowed)
- LEADS  (L and D – allowed)
- MEADS  (not a valid word)
- FEADS  (not a valid word)
- BEAKS  (K allowed, but ends with S, so _ E A K S – BEAKS is valid)
- LEAKS  (L, K allowed)
- VEGET  (but T is banned)
- WEASEL  (too long)
- YEAST  (T banned)
- BEADS, LEADS, BEAKS, LEAKS all fit.

Between these, BEADS and LEADS both use D, which hasn’t been tested yet. Let’s pick BEADS first since B is a common starting letter.

So the next guess is BEADS.

From the feedback so far we know the word must be of the form _ E A _ S and the letters in positions 2, 3, 5 are definitely E, A, S respectively.  
Letters already ruled out for positions 1 and 4 are: R, O, T, H, P, B, D.  
Remaining consonants that can legally fill positions 1 and 4 include C, F, G, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

We now need a valid English word that fits the pattern C E A _ S, F E A _ S, G E A _ S, L E A _ S, M E A _ S, N E A _ S, V E A _ S, W E A _ S, or Y E A _ S.

Quick scan of common words:
- LEAFY – but Y is allowed and it’s 5 letters, and we haven’t tried L yet.
- MEANS – fits _ E A _ S, uses M and N, neither of which has been excluded.
- VEGET – T is banned.
- WEARY – Y is allowed, but W and R – R is banned.
- YEAST – T is banned.
- LEANS – fits, uses L and N.
- FEARS – R is banned.
- KEATS – K, T – T is banned.
- LEAFY – L, F, Y – all allowed.

Between LEAFY, LEANS, and MEANS, LEANS uses two new letters (L, N) and is a common word. Let’s go with LEANS.
