For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in position 2
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is not in position 4
- E: in the word but wrong position (-) → E is not in position 5

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must include S and E, but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively
- Must not include A or O

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is R, so 1,3,4)

Let me try a word that fits _ R _ _ _, includes S and E in allowed positions, and avoids A and O. A good candidate is ""TRIES"":
- T: new letter to test
- R: confirmed in position 2
- I: new vowel to test
- E: in position 4 (allowed, since E was not in position 5 originally)
- S: in position 5 (allowed, since S was not in position 4 originally)

This should give us more information about T, I, and the placement of E and S.

   - Cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE feedback: E was in position 5 and marked “-”)
   - Cannot be in position 5 (already S)

Try “GRUES” – E is in position 4, which is allowed.  
Check: G R U E S – positions: 1-G, 2-R, 3-U, 4-E, 5-S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in position 2
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is not in position 4
- E: in the word but wrong position (-) → E is not in position 5

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must include S and E, but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively
- Must not include A or O

Possible positions for S: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is R, so 1,3,4)

Let me try a word that fits _ R _ _ _, includes S and E in allowed positions, and avoids A and O. A good candidate is ""TRIES"":
- T: new letter to test
- R: confirmed in position 2
- I: new vowel to test
- E: in position 4 (allowed, since E was not in position 5 originally)
- S: in position 5 (allowed, since S was not in position 4 originally)

This should give us more information about T, I, and the placement of E and S.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R _ _ S  
   (R is fixed in position 2, S is fixed in position 5)

2. Letters that are **in** the word: R, S, E  
   (E was marked “-” in both guesses, so it must appear somewhere else)

3. Letters that are **out**: A, O, T, I  

4. Possible positions for E:
   - Cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE feedback: E was in position 5 and marked “-”)
   - Cannot be in position 5 (already S)
   - Cannot be in position 2 (R)
   - So E must be in position 1 or 3.

5. Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y  
   (Vowels already tried: A, O, I; only U is still untested.)

Let’s test E in position 1 and pick a consonant for position 3 that hasn’t been ruled out.  
A strong candidate is “ERUSS” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next, “ENTRY” – but T is out.  
Try “ERNST” – T is out.  
Try “ERN” + a consonant: “ERNSP” – invalid.  
Try “ER” + a consonant + “S”: “ERBUS” – invalid.  
Try “CREPS” – R must be in position 2.  
Try “BRENS” – valid word? No.  
Try “DRESS” – S already in position 5.  
Try “PRESS” – P is still allowed, but S is already fixed in position 5.  
Try “PRESS” – pattern _ R _ _ S, so P R E S S: positions 1-5: P R E S S – but S is already in position 5, so duplicate S is impossible.  
Try “PRESS” is invalid due to duplicate S.  
Try “GREES” – E in position 3: G R E E S – duplicate E.  
Try “CREPS” – C R E P S – valid word? No.  
Try “FRESH” – H is allowed, but must end with S.  
Try “FRESH” is invalid (must end with S).  
Try “FRESH” – no.  
Try “PRESS” – no.  
Try “BRENS” – no.  
Try “CRISP” – ends with P, not S.  
Try “GRIST” – T is out.  
Try “GRIPS” – ends with S, pattern _ R _ _ S: G R I P S – but I is out.  
Try “GRUES” – U is allowed, E in position 3: G R U E S – but must have E somewhere.  
Try “GRUES” – E is in position 4, which is allowed.  
Check: G R U E S – positions: 1-G, 2-R, 3-U, 4-E, 5-S.  
- R is in position 2 ✓  
- S is in position 5 ✓  
- E is in position 4 (originally was in 5 and marked “-”, so 4 is allowed)  
- No A, O, T, I ✓  
- All letters are unique, no duplicates.  

“GRUES” is a valid English word meaning “marks of sorrow or distress.”  
Let’s go with GRUES.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: G R _ _ S  
   (G in 1, R in 2, S in 5 are all confirmed)

2. Letters **in** the word: G, R, S, E  
   (E was marked “-” in GRUES, so it must appear once more)

3. Letters **out**: A, O, T, I, U  

4. Possible positions for E:  
   - Cannot be 4 (from GRUES feedback: E in 4 marked “-”)  
   - Cannot be 5 (already S)  
   - Cannot be 2 (R)  
   - Cannot be 1 (G)  
   ⇒ E **must** be in position 3.

So the word is: G R E _ S

Only one blank remains (position 4).  
Allowed consonants (unused, not ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: only E already used, A, O, I, U ruled out.

Common 5-letter words fitting G R E _ S:
- GREES – invalid (double E)  
- GREYS – Y allowed, valid word  
- GREPS – P allowed, valid word  
- GREDS – D allowed, valid word  
- GRESK – invalid (not English)  
- GRET? – T ruled out

- GREFS – F allowed, but “GREFS” isn’t standard  
- GREHS – H allowed, but not a word  

Best candidates: GREYS, GREPS, GREDS.

From Guess 5 (GROWS) we now have:

- G ✓ (position 1)  
- R ✓ (position 2)  
- O x → O is NOT in the word  
- W x → W is NOT in the word  
- S ✓ (position 5)  

We already knew E must be in position 3 (from earlier “-” marks), so the pattern is:

G R E _ S

Letters already ruled out: A, O, T, I, U, Y, W  
Letters confirmed in the word: G, R, E, S

The only letter left to test in position 4 is B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, Z.

The only fully valid, common English word left is GREBS (the plural of grebe, a type of water bird).  
Since this is our sixth and final guess, we must try it.
