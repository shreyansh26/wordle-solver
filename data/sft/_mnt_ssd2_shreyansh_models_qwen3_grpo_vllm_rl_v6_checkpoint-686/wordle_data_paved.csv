For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first guess should contain several of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices among Wordle players for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

1. Uses A and E in different positions.
2. Avoids R, O, S.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y.

Possible candidates:
- EATEN (but repeats E and T, not ideal)
- ALERT (but has R, which we know is absent)
- LEANT (uses L, E, A, N, T - all allowed)
- PLATE (but has P and T, and E in position 5 which we know is wrong)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose correct positions are still unknown:
A (cannot be in position 1 or 3)
E (cannot be in position 2 or 5)

So the secret word must contain both A and E, and must not contain any of R, O, S, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no R, O, S, L, N, T).

Let’s list possible positions for A and E:

A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We also want to introduce new common letters to narrow things down.

Candidate words:
- CEDIA (but has D and I, but A is in position 5 which is allowed, E is in position 3 which is allowed) – but CEDIA is not a common word.
- MEDIA (M, E, D, I, A) – M, E, D, I, A are all allowed. E is in position 2 which is NOT allowed (from feedback, E cannot be in position 2). So MEDIA is invalid.
- PIVOT – has T (invalid)
- CAGED – has D, G, E, A, C. E is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 3 (not allowed). Invalid.
- DAILY – has L (invalid)
- GUESS – has S (invalid)
- CREAM – has R (invalid)
- BEACH – has B, E, A, C, H. E is in position 2 (invalid)
- HEDGE – has H, E, D, G, E. E in position 2 and 5 (invalid)
- MIDGE – has M, I, D, G, E. E in position 5 (invalid)
- VEXED – has V, E, X, E, D. E in position 2 and 4 (invalid)
- CEDAR – has R (invalid)
- CEDIA – E in position 3 (allowed), A in position 5 (allowed). Letters C, E, D, I, A – all allowed. This seems valid.
- MEDIA – already ruled out because E is in position 2.
- PEDIA – P, E, D, I, A. E in position 2 (invalid)
- VEDIA – V, E, D, I, A. E in position 2 (invalid)
- CEDIA appears to be the only common-ish word left that fits all constraints.

Let me double-check CEDIA:
- Letters: C, E, D, I, A – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (invalid, because in LEANT E was in position 2 and feedback said E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 2).

Oops, E in position 2 is still invalid. So CEDIA is out.

Next candidate: CEDAR – has R (invalid)
Next: CEDIS – has S (invalid)
Next: CEDIA – same as CEDIA, E in position 2 (invalid)

Let me think differently: we need E in position 1, 3, or 4, and A in position 2, 4, or 5, with no overlap on forbidden positions.

Possible positions:
E in 1, A in 2,4,5
E in 3, A in 2,4,5 (but A cannot be in 3 anyway)
E in 4, A in 2,5

Let’s try E in 4, A in 2:
_ A _ E _
Letters left: must pick from I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Possible words:
- C A M E D – not a word
- C A P E D – not a word
- C A G E D – not a word
- C A M E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E D – CAVED is a word (past tense of cave). Let’s check:
  - CAVED: C, A, V, E, D
  - Letters: C, A, V, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
  - A is in position 2 (allowed).
  - E is in position 4 (allowed).
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: CAVED.

Let me check another possibility: E in 1, A in 4 or 5:
E _ _ A _
E _ _ _ A
E _ A _ _
E _ _ _ A

But E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _ – possible word: EAGER – has R (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – EJECT – has J (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). But EJECT has J which is less common, but valid.
But EJECT has E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed), and letters E, J, E, C, T. T is invalid (from LEANT feedback T is not in word). So EJECT is out.

Another: E _ _ _ A – E M I C A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I D A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I S A – has S (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – E M I T A – has T (invalid)

E in 3, A in 2 or 4 or 5 (but A cannot be in 3):
_ A E _ _ – but A cannot be in 2 if E is in 3? No, A can be in 2, E in 3. But in LEANT A was in position 3 and got (-), so A cannot be in 3. So A in 2 or 4 or 5, E in 3:
_ _ E A _ – but A cannot be in 3 (already ruled out)
_ _ E _ A – possible: D E E P A – not a word
B E E P A – not a word
C H E E P – not 5 letters
C H E A T – has T (invalid)
C H E A P – C, H, E, A, P – all allowed. Let’s check:
CHEAP:
- Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- This seems valid.

Between CAVED and CHEAP:
CAVED: C, A, V, E, D – all allowed, A in 2, E in 4.
CHEAP: C, H, E, A, P – all allowed, A in 4, E in 3.

Both fit. CAVED introduces V and D, CHEAP introduces H and P. Both are good, but CHEAP uses more common letters (C, H, E, A, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with CHEAP.

E in 3, A in 2,4,5 (but A cannot be in 3 anyway)
E in 4, A in 2,5

Let’s try E in 4, A in 2:
_ A _ E _
Letters left: must pick from I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Possible words:
- C A M E D – not a word
- C A P E D – not a word
- C A G E D – not a word
- C A M E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E D – CAVED is a word (past tense of cave). Let’s check:
  - CAVED: C, A, V, E, D
  - Letters: C, A, V, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
  - A is in position 2 (allowed).
  - E is in position 4 (allowed).
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: CAVED.

Let me check another possibility: E in 1, A in 4 or 5:
E _ _ A _
E _ _ _ A
E _ A _ _
E _ _ _ A

But E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _ – possible word: EAGER – has R (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – EJECT – has J (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). But EJECT has J which is less common, but valid.
But EJECT has E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed), and letters E, J, E, C, T. T is invalid (from LEANT feedback T is not in word). So EJECT is out.

Another: E _ _ _ A – E M I C A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I D A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I S A – has S (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – E M I T A – has T (invalid)

E in 3, A in 2 or 4 or 5 (but A cannot be in 3):
_ A E _ _ – but A cannot be in 2 if E is in 3? No, A can be in 2, E in 3. But in LEANT A was in position 3 and got (-), so A cannot be in 3. So A in 2 or 4 or 5, E in 3:
_ _ E A _ – but A cannot be in 3 (already ruled out)
_ _ E _ A – possible: D E E P A – not a word
B E E P A – not a word
C H E E P – not 5 letters
C H E A T – has T (invalid)
C H E A P – C, H, E, A, P – all allowed. Let’s check:
CHEAP:
- Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- This seems valid.

Between CAVED and CHEAP:
CAVED: C, A, V, E, D – all allowed, A in 2, E in 4.
CHEAP: C, H, E, A, P – all allowed, A in 4, E in 3.

Both fit. CAVED introduces V and D, CHEAP introduces H and P. Both are good, but CHEAP uses more common letters (C, H, E, A, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with CHEAP.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first guess should contain several of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices among Wordle players for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next I need a word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions.
2. Avoids R, O, S.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y.

Possible candidates:
- EATEN (but repeats E and T, not ideal)
- ALERT (but has R, which we know is absent)
- LEANT (uses L, E, A, N, T - all allowed)
- PLATE (but has P and T, and E in position 5 which we know is wrong)
- CAGED (but has D, G, and E in position 5 which is wrong)

""LEANT"" looks good:
- Uses A (position 2) and E (position 1), both different from previous positions.
- Introduces L, N, T - all common and allowed.
- No R, O, S.

<guess>LEANT</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose correct positions are still unknown:
A (cannot be in position 1 or 3)
E (cannot be in position 2 or 5)

So the secret word must contain both A and E, and must not contain any of R, O, S, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no R, O, S, L, N, T).

Let’s list possible positions for A and E:

A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We also want to introduce new common letters to narrow things down.

Candidate words:
- CEDIA (but has D and I, but A is in position 5 which is allowed, E is in position 3 which is allowed) – but CEDIA is not a common word.
- MEDIA (M, E, D, I, A) – M, E, D, I, A are all allowed. E is in position 2 which is NOT allowed (from feedback, E cannot be in position 2). So MEDIA is invalid.
- PIVOT – has T (invalid)
- CAGED – has D, G, E, A, C. E is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 3 (not allowed). Invalid.
- DAILY – has L (invalid)
- GUESS – has S (invalid)
- CREAM – has R (invalid)
- BEACH – has B, E, A, C, H. E is in position 2 (invalid)
- HEDGE – has H, E, D, G, E. E in position 2 and 5 (invalid)
- MIDGE – has M, I, D, G, E. E in position 5 (invalid)
- VEXED – has V, E, X, E, D. E in position 2 and 4 (invalid)
- CEDAR – has R (invalid)
- CEDIA – E in position 3 (allowed), A in position 5 (allowed). Letters C, E, D, I, A – all allowed. This seems valid.
- MEDIA – already ruled out because E is in position 2.
- PEDIA – P, E, D, I, A. E in position 2 (invalid)
- VEDIA – V, E, D, I, A. E in position 2 (invalid)
- CEDIA appears to be the only common-ish word left that fits all constraints.

Let me double-check CEDIA:
- Letters: C, E, D, I, A – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (invalid, because in LEANT E was in position 2 and feedback said E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 2).

Oops, E in position 2 is still invalid. So CEDIA is out.

Next candidate: CEDAR – has R (invalid)
Next: CEDIS – has S (invalid)
Next: CEDIA – same as CEDIA, E in position 2 (invalid)

Let me think differently: we need E in position 1, 3, or 4, and A in position 2, 4, or 5, with no overlap on forbidden positions.

Possible positions:
E in 1, A in 2,4,5
E in 3, A in 2,4,5 (but A cannot be in 3 anyway)
E in 4, A in 2,5

Let’s try E in 4, A in 2:
_ A _ E _
Letters left: must pick from I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Possible words:
- C A M E D – not a word
- C A P E D – not a word
- C A G E D – not a word
- C A M E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E D – CAVED is a word (past tense of cave). Let’s check:
  - CAVED: C, A, V, E, D
  - Letters: C, A, V, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
  - A is in position 2 (allowed).
  - E is in position 4 (allowed).
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: CAVED.

Let me check another possibility: E in 1, A in 4 or 5:
E _ _ A _
E _ _ _ A
E _ A _ _
E _ _ _ A

But E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _ – possible word: EAGER – has R (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – EJECT – has J (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). But EJECT has J which is less common, but valid.
But EJECT has E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed), and letters E, J, E, C, T. T is invalid (from LEANT feedback T is not in word). So EJECT is out.

Another: E _ _ _ A – E M I C A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I D A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I S A – has S (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – E M I T A – has T (invalid)

E in 3, A in 2 or 4 or 5 (but A cannot be in 3):
_ A E _ _ – but A cannot be in 2 if E is in 3? No, A can be in 2, E in 3. But in LEANT A was in position 3 and got (-), so A cannot be in 3. So A in 2 or 4 or 5, E in 3:
_ _ E A _ – but A cannot be in 3 (already ruled out)
_ _ E _ A – possible: D E E P A – not a word
B E E P A – not a word
C H E E P – not 5 letters
C H E A T – has T (invalid)
C H E A P – C, H, E, A, P – all allowed. Let’s check:
CHEAP:
- Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- This seems valid.

Between CAVED and CHEAP:
CAVED: C, A, V, E, D – all allowed, A in 2, E in 4.
CHEAP: C, H, E, A, P – all allowed, A in 4, E in 3.

Both fit. CAVED introduces V and D, CHEAP introduces H and P. Both are good, but CHEAP uses more common letters (C, H, E, A, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with CHEAP.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown (-):
A, E, P (all three received “-” in CHEAP, so each is in the word but not in the positions tried so far)

Known positional restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5
- P cannot be in position 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 5 (but 5 is still open for A)
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- P must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, E, P (each exactly once) and only uses letters that have not yet been ruled out (i.e., not R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H).

Remaining common letters: I, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Q, J, Z, X

We want to test new positions for A, E, P while introducing fresh common letters.

Candidate construction:
- A must be in 2 or 5
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4
- P must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
- Put E in position 1 (allowed)
- Put A in position 2 (allowed)
- Put P in position 3 (allowed)
- Positions 4 and 5 must be filled with new letters from the allowed set.

Word skeleton: E A P _ _

We need two more distinct letters from {I, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Q, J, Z, X} that form a valid English word when combined with EAP.

Possible endings:
- EAPID – not a word
- EAPID – not a word
- EAPED – EAPED is not a valid English word
- EAPED – not valid
- EAPED – not valid
- EAPED – not valid

Let me try another arrangement:
- E in 3
- A in 5
- P in 1 or 2

Example: P _ E _ A
Letters left: choose from {I, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Q, J, Z, X}

Try P I E C A – but C is ruled out
P I E D A – not a word
P I E M A – not a word
P I E G A – not a word
P I E B A – not a word
P I E F A – not a word
P I E K A – not a word
P I E V A – not a word
P I E W A – not a word
P I E Y A – not a word

Next arrangement:
- E in 4
- A in 2 or 5
- P in 1, 2, 3

Try:
- P _ _ E A
Letters: P, _, _, E, A
Need two middle letters from allowed set.

Possible: P I D E A – not a word
P I G E A – not a word
P I M E A – not a word
P I V E A – not a word
P I W E A – not a word
P I Y E A – not a word

Try A in 5:
- _ _ _ E A
But then P must be in 1-4 and E is in 4, so P must be in 1-3.

Example: D I P E A – not a word
G I P E A – not a word

Let me list all valid 5-letter words that contain A, E, P and only use allowed letters.

Allowed letters: A, E, P, I, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Q, J, Z, X

<guess>GAPED</guess>",GAPED,"From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown (-):
A, E, P (all three received “-” in CHEAP, so each is in the word but not in the positions tried so far)

Known positional restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5
- P cannot be in position 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 5 (but 5 is still open for A)
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- P must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, E, P (each exactly once) and only uses letters that have not yet been ruled out (i.e., not R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H).

Remaining common letters: I, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Q, J, Z, X

We want to test new positions for A, E, P while introducing fresh common letters.

Candidate construction:
- A must be in 2 or 5
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4
- P must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
- Put E in position 1 (allowed)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first guess should contain several of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices among Wordle players for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next I need a word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions.
2. Avoids R, O, S.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y.

Possible candidates:
- EATEN (but repeats E and T, not ideal)
- ALERT (but has R, which we know is absent)
- LEANT (uses L, E, A, N, T - all allowed)
- PLATE (but has P and T, and E in position 5 which we know is wrong)
- CAGED (but has D, G, and E in position 5 which is wrong)

""LEANT"" looks good:
- Uses A (position 2) and E (position 1), both different from previous positions.
- Introduces L, N, T - all common and allowed.
- No R, O, S.

Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose correct positions are still unknown:
A (cannot be in position 1 or 3)
E (cannot be in position 2 or 5)

So the secret word must contain both A and E, and must not contain any of R, O, S, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no R, O, S, L, N, T).

Let’s list possible positions for A and E:

A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We also want to introduce new common letters to narrow things down.

Candidate words:
- CEDIA (but has D and I, but A is in position 5 which is allowed, E is in position 3 which is allowed) – but CEDIA is not a common word.
- MEDIA (M, E, D, I, A) – M, E, D, I, A are all allowed. E is in position 2 which is NOT allowed (from feedback, E cannot be in position 2). So MEDIA is invalid.
- PIVOT – has T (invalid)
- CAGED – has D, G, E, A, C. E is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 3 (not allowed). Invalid.
- DAILY – has L (invalid)
- GUESS – has S (invalid)
- CREAM – has R (invalid)
- BEACH – has B, E, A, C, H. E is in position 2 (invalid)
- HEDGE – has H, E, D, G, E. E in position 2 and 5 (invalid)
- MIDGE – has M, I, D, G, E. E in position 5 (invalid)
- VEXED – has V, E, X, E, D. E in position 2 and 4 (invalid)
- CEDAR – has R (invalid)
- CEDIA – E in position 3 (allowed), A in position 5 (allowed). Letters C, E, D, I, A – all allowed. This seems valid.
- MEDIA – already ruled out because E is in position 2.
- PEDIA – P, E, D, I, A. E in position 2 (invalid)
- VEDIA – V, E, D, I, A. E in position 2 (invalid)
- CEDIA appears to be the only common-ish word left that fits all constraints.

Let me double-check CEDIA:
- Letters: C, E, D, I, A – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (invalid, because in LEANT E was in position 2 and feedback said E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 2).

Oops, E in position 2 is still invalid. So CEDIA is out.

Next candidate: CEDAR – has R (invalid)
Next: CEDIS – has S (invalid)
Next: CEDIA – same as CEDIA, E in position 2 (invalid)

Let me think differently: we need E in position 1, 3, or 4, and A in position 2, 4, or 5, with no overlap on forbidden positions.

Possible positions:
E in 1, A in 2,4,5
E in 3, A in 2,4,5 (but A cannot be in 3 anyway)
E in 4, A in 2,5

Let’s try E in 4, A in 2:
_ A _ E _
Letters left: must pick from I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Possible words:
- C A M E D – not a word
- C A P E D – not a word
- C A G E D – not a word
- C A M E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E R – has R (invalid)
- C A V E D – CAVED is a word (past tense of cave). Let’s check:
  - CAVED: C, A, V, E, D
  - Letters: C, A, V, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
  - A is in position 2 (allowed).
  - E is in position 4 (allowed).
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: CAVED.

Let me check another possibility: E in 1, A in 4 or 5:
E _ _ A _
E _ _ _ A
E _ A _ _
E _ _ _ A

But E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _ – possible word: EAGER – has R (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – EJECT – has J (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). But EJECT has J which is less common, but valid.
But EJECT has E in 1 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed), and letters E, J, E, C, T. T is invalid (from LEANT feedback T is not in word). So EJECT is out.

Another: E _ _ _ A – E M I C A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I D A – not a word
E _ _ _ A – E M I S A – has S (invalid)
E _ _ _ A – E M I T A – has T (invalid)

E in 3, A in 2 or 4 or 5 (but A cannot be in 3):
_ A E _ _ – but A cannot be in 2 if E is in 3? No, A can be in 2, E in 3. But in LEANT A was in position 3 and got (-), so A cannot be in 3. So A in 2 or 4 or 5, E in 3:
_ _ E A _ – but A cannot be in 3 (already ruled out)
_ _ E _ A – possible: D E E P A – not a word
B E E P A – not a word
C H E E P – not 5 letters
C H E A T – has T (invalid)
C H E A P – C, H, E, A, P – all allowed. Let’s check:
CHEAP:
- Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none of R, O, S, L, N, T.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- This seems valid.

Between CAVED and CHEAP:
CAVED: C, A, V, E, D – all allowed, A in 2, E in 4.
CHEAP: C, H, E, A, P – all allowed, A in 4, E in 3.

Both fit. CAVED introduces V and D, CHEAP introduces H and P. Both are good, but CHEAP uses more common letters (C, H, E, A, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with CHEAP.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown (-):
A, E, P (all three received “-” in CHEAP, so each is in the word but not in the positions tried so far)

Known positional restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5
- P cannot be in position 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2 or 5 (but 5 is still open for A)
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- P must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, E, P (each exactly once) and only uses letters that have not yet been ruled out (i.e., not R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H).

Remaining common letters: I, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Q, J, Z, X

We want to test new positions for A, E, P while introducing fresh common letters.

Candidate construction:

Let’s try:
- Put E in position 1 (allowed)

P I G E A – not a word
P I M E A – not a word
P I V E A – not a word
P I W E A – not a word
P I Y E A – not a word

Try A in 5:
- _ _ _ E A
But then P must be in 1-4 and E is in 4, so P must be in 1-3.

Example: D I P E A – not a word
G I P E A – not a word
B I P E A – not a word
F I P E A – not a word
K I P E A – not a word

- E in 1, 3, or 4
- P in 1, 3, 4

Try E A _ _ _ – but then P must be in 3 or 4
E A P _ _ – need two letters: E A P I D – not a word
E A P U D – not a word
E A P I G – not a word

Try _ A P _ E – but E must be in 1,3,4
This seems messy.

Let me list all valid 5-letter words that contain A, E, P and only use allowed letters.

From the latest feedback:

This tells us:

1. A is now fixed in position 2.
2. E is now fixed in position 4.
3. D is fixed in position 5.
4. P is in the word but NOT in position 3.
5. G is NOT in the word.

So the known pattern so far is:
_ A _ E D

Letters still required:
- P must appear exactly once, and cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore P must be in position 1.
That gives us P A _ E D.

The only remaining letter is for position 3.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
All letters except R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, G.

Common remaining consonants: B, F, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form PA _ ED.

Checking dictionary:
- PAVED – V is allowed, and PAVED is a valid word.
- PABED – not a word.
- PAIED – archaic spelling, not standard.
- PAKED – not a word.
- PAMED – not a word.
- PAUED – not a word.
- PAVED – valid.

Therefore the only plausible candidate is PAVED.
