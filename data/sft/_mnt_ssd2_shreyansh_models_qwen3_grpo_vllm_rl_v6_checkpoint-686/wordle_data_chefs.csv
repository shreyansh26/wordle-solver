For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some strong candidates are:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it covers 5 of the most common letters without repeating any, giving us maximum coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.
- Has 5 letters, none of which are A, R, I.

We need a new word that:
- Uses S and E (but places them in different positions).
- Avoids A, R, I.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S in pos 1, E in pos 4) – but O and L are good letters.
- SPOKE (S in pos 1, E in pos 4) – P, O, K are useful.
- TENSE (E in pos 2 and 4) – T, N are good.
- SLATE (S in pos 1, E in pos 5) – L, T are good.

""SLATE"" uses S and E in new positions (1 and 5) and introduces L, T, A (but A is already excluded). Wait, A is excluded, so SLATE is invalid.

""STOLE"" uses S, T, O, L, E – all allowed so far (no A, R, I).
- S moves from pos 4 to pos 1.
- E moves from pos 5 to pos 4.

This seems like a good second guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some strong candidates are:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it covers 5 of the most common letters without repeating any, giving us maximum coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.
- Has 5 letters, none of which are A, R, I.

We need a new word that:
- Uses S and E (but places them in different positions).
- Avoids A, R, I.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S in pos 1, E in pos 4) – but O and L are good letters.
- SPOKE (S in pos 1, E in pos 4) – P, O, K are useful.
- TENSE (E in pos 2 and 4) – T, N are good.
- SLATE (S in pos 1, E in pos 5) – L, T are good.

""SLATE"" uses S and E in new positions (1 and 5) and introduces L, T, A (but A is already excluded). Wait, A is excluded, so SLATE is invalid.

""STOLE"" uses S, T, O, L, E – all allowed so far (no A, R, I).
- S moves from pos 4 to pos 1.
- E moves from pos 5 to pos 4.

This seems like a good second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, T, O, L  
Letters that ARE in the word (but still unknown in position): S, E  

So the secret word:
- Contains both S and E exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, T, O, L.
- Has 5 letters in total.

Remaining common letters to try: N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S and E and only letters not yet ruled out.  
Some possibilities:
- N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, K, B, F, V, W are still allowed.

A good candidate is “UNSET”:
- Uses S and E (S in 4th, E in 5th – new positions).
- Uses U, N (both still allowed).
- Does not use any excluded letters.

Another candidate is “MUSED”:
- Uses S and E (S in 3rd, E in 5th).
- Uses M, U, D (all still allowed).

Between these, “UNSET” spreads S and E across more new positions, giving more information. So I’ll choose “UNSET”.

and must also contain E somewhere in positions 1-4 (since E has only been tried in 2,4,5 and all wrong).

Positions tried:  
E: 2 (wrong), 4 (wrong), 5 (wrong) → E must be in 1 or 3.  
S: 1 (wrong), 3 (wrong), 4 (wrong), 5 (correct) → S is fixed at 5.

Thus the pattern is:  
E _ _ _ S   or   _ E _ _ S

From Guess 4 we learned C is in the word but not in position 3 (since C got “-” in DECKS).  
So C must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s list possible words:

1. E C _ _ S  
   Need two more letters from remaining pool for positions 3 and 4.  
   Example: E C H Y S → “ECHYS” (not a valid word).  
   E C H E S → E twice (invalid).  
   E C H O S → O ruled out.  
   E C H Y S → invalid.  
   E C H E S → invalid.

   E C H Y S → invalid.

   Example: M Y E C S → “MYECS” (invalid).  

7. C E _ _ S  
   Example: C E H Y S → “CEHYS” (invalid).  

8. C _ E _ S  
   Example: C H E M S → “CHEMS” (valid word, 5 letters, uses C, H, E, M, S).  
   Check letters: C, H, E, M, S – none ruled out.  
   Positions:  
   C in 1 (new), E in 3 (new), M in 4 (new), S in 5 (correct).  
   This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be “CHEMS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some strong candidates are:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it covers 5 of the most common letters without repeating any, giving us maximum coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.
- Has 5 letters, none of which are A, R, I.

We need a new word that:
- Uses S and E (but places them in different positions).
- Avoids A, R, I.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S in pos 1, E in pos 4) – but O and L are good letters.
- SPOKE (S in pos 1, E in pos 4) – P, O, K are useful.
- TENSE (E in pos 2 and 4) – T, N are good.
- SLATE (S in pos 1, E in pos 5) – L, T are good.

""SLATE"" uses S and E in new positions (1 and 5) and introduces L, T, A (but A is already excluded). Wait, A is excluded, so SLATE is invalid.

""STOLE"" uses S, T, O, L, E – all allowed so far (no A, R, I).
- S moves from pos 4 to pos 1.
- E moves from pos 5 to pos 4.

This seems like a good second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, T, O, L  
Letters that ARE in the word (but still unknown in position): S, E  

So the secret word:
- Contains both S and E exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, T, O, L.
- Has 5 letters in total.

Remaining common letters to try: N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S and E and only letters not yet ruled out.  
Some possibilities:
- N, C, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, K, B, F, V, W are still allowed.

A good candidate is “UNSET”:
- Uses S and E (S in 4th, E in 5th – new positions).
- Uses U, N (both still allowed).
- Does not use any excluded letters.

Another candidate is “MUSED”:
- Uses S and E (S in 3rd, E in 5th).
- Uses M, U, D (all still allowed).

Between these, “UNSET” spreads S and E across more new positions, giving more information. So I’ll choose “UNSET”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, I, T, O, L, U, N  

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
S and E (each appears exactly once).

Positions we have tried for S:  
- 4th place (ARISE) – wrong  
- 1st place (STOLE) – wrong  
- 3rd place (UNSET) – wrong  

Positions we have tried for E:  
- 5th place (ARISE) – wrong  
- 4th place (STOLE) – wrong  
- 5th place (UNSET) – wrong  

So the remaining possible positions for S are: 2 or 5.  
The remaining possible positions for E are: 1 or 2 (but they must occupy different slots).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E once each.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Places S in 2nd or 5th and E in 1st or 2nd (without overlap).

Available letters (not yet eliminated):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus S and E.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If S is in position 2, then E must be in position 1.
  Pattern: E S _ _ _
  Fill with allowed letters: E S C H E – invalid (E repeated).  
  E S C H O – O is ruled out.  
  E S C H Y – valid: ESCHY (but is this a word? Probably not).  
  E S C H E – again E twice.  
  E S C H E – no.  
  E S C H Y – not a valid English word.

- If S is in position 5, then E can be in 1 or 2.
  Pattern 1: E _ _ _ S  
  Pattern 2: _ E _ _ S  

Pattern 1: E _ _ _ S  
Fill with allowed letters: E C H O S – O ruled out.  
E C H Y S – not a word.  
E C H E S – E twice.  
E C H O S – O out.  
E C H Y S – no.  

Pattern 2: _ E _ _ S  
First letter must be from available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Try C: C E _ _ S  
Possible: C E D A S – A ruled out.  
C E D A S – A out.  
C E D E S – E twice.  
C E D Y S – not a word.  
C E D A S – A out.  

Try D: D E _ _ S  
D E C K S – valid word!  
Letters: D, E, C, K, S – none ruled out.  
Positions:  
E in 2nd (new for E), S in 5th (new for S), and C, D, K are fresh.

This fits all constraints.

and must also contain E somewhere in positions 1-4 (since E has only been tried in 2,4,5 and all wrong).

Positions tried:  
E: 2 (wrong), 4 (wrong), 5 (wrong) → E must be in 1 or 3.  
S: 1 (wrong), 3 (wrong), 4 (wrong), 5 (correct) → S is fixed at 5.

Thus the pattern is:  
E _ _ _ S   or   _ E _ _ S

From Guess 4 we learned C is in the word but not in position 3 (since C got “-” in DECKS).  
So C must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s list possible words:

1. E C _ _ S  
   Need two more letters from remaining pool for positions 3 and 4.  
   Example: E C H Y S → “ECHYS” (not a valid word).  
   E C H E S → E twice (invalid).  
   E C H O S → O ruled out.  
   E C H Y S → invalid.  
   E C H E S → invalid.  
   E C H Y S → invalid.  
   E C H Y S → invalid.  
   E C H Y S → invalid.  
   E C H Y S → invalid.  

2. E _ C _ S

   E B C H S → “EBCHS” (invalid).  

3. E _ _ C S

6. _ _ E C S  
   Example: M Y E C S → “MYECS” (invalid).  

7. C E _ _ S  
   Example: C E H Y S → “CEHYS” (invalid).  

8. C _ E _ S  
   Example: C H E M S → “CHEMS” (valid word, 5 letters, uses C, H, E, M, S).  
   Check letters: C, H, E, M, S – none ruled out.  
   Positions:  
   C in 1 (new), E in 3 (new), M in 4 (new), S in 5 (correct).

From Guess 5 (CHEMS) we just got all four letters correct except M:

C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) M(x) S(✓)

That means the secret word is:

C H E _ S

Only the fourth letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out (from all previous feedback):  
A, R, I, T, O, L, U, N, D, K, M

Remaining letters that can fill the fourth position:  
B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y

Looking for a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern C H E _ S.

Possible candidates:  
CHEBS – not a standard word  
CHEFS – valid (French for chefs, recognized in English word lists)  
CHEGS – not a word  
CHEPS – not a word  
CHEWS – valid  
CHEYS – not a word  

Between CHEFS and CHEWS, both are valid.  
CHEFS uses F (still allowed).  
CHEWS uses W (still allowed).  

Both are legitimate guesses, but CHEFS is slightly more common in word lists.  
I’ll go with CHEFS first.
