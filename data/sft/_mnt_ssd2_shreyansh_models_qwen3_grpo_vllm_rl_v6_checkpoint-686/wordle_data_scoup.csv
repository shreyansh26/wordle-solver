### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AROSE."" These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities early.

""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A and E are the two most frequent letters
- T is very common
- It covers 5 distinct letters with high frequency

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word is S _ _ _ _ and none of L, A, T, E appear anywhere.  
We now need a 5-letter word starting with S that avoids those four letters.

Common letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next word should test several new common consonants and vowels.  
“SHOCK” is strong because it introduces H, O, C, K while keeping S fixed in the first spot.  
Other good candidates could be “SNICK”, “SPURN”, “STOCK”, but T and O are already common so “SHOCK” gives us H, O, C, K to test.

Let’s go with SHOCK.

Current known facts:
- Word starts with S (S is fixed in position 1).
- O is in the word and is in position 3 (because O got ✓ in SHOCK).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because C got “-” in SHOCK).
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, K.

So the pattern so far is: S _ O _ _

C must appear in one of positions 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already O, so C must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps S _ O _ _
- Places C in position 2 (to test that placement)
- Introduces new common letters for positions 4 and 5.

Candidate: SCOUP (S C O U P)
- C in position 2.
- U and P are new letters to test.

Another candidate: SCOUR (S C O U R) – but R is less common than P, so SCOUP is slightly better.
