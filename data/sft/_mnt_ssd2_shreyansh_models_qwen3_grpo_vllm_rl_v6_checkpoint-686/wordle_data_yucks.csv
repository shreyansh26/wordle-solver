For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these without repeating letters. Common strong starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

- S is not in position 1 or 5.  
- U is not in position 3.  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, M, P.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, D, G, H, K, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed, and A, O, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and U.  
- S not in positions 1 or 5.  
- U not in position 3.  
- No A, R, O, E, T, M, P.

Possible patterns for S: positions 2, 3, or 4.  
Possible patterns for U: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- S _ _ _ _ or _ S _ _ _ or _ _ S _ _  
- U in any allowed position.

Candidate: “NUSKY” – but Y is less common and K is okay.  
Another: “DUSKY” – D and K are good letters.  
Another: “HUSKS” – H, U, S, K, S – but S repeats and position 5 is disallowed for S.  
Another: “LUNGS” – L, U, N, G, S – positions: S in 5 (disallowed), so no.  
Another: “FUNDS” – F, U, N, D, S – positions: S in 5 (disallowed).  
Another: “SUNNY” – S in 1 (disallowed).  
Another: “LUNGS” already rejected.  
Another: “DUNGS” – S in 5 (disallowed).  
Another: “LUNGS” again.

Wait, let’s try “LUNGS” again: S is in 5, which is disallowed.  
So we need S in 2, 3, or 4.

How about “NUSKS” – S in 4, U in 2. Letters: N, U, S, K, S – S repeats and position 5 is S (disallowed).  

“DUSKS” – same issue with S in 5.  

“FUSKS” – same.  

“LUNDS” – not a word.  

“LUNGS” – S in 5, no.  

“LUNDS” – not valid.  

“LUNGS” – again S in 5.  

Let me think differently: S must be in 2, 3, or 4.  

Example: _ S _ _ _  
- “BUSKS” – B, U, S, K, S – S repeats and 5 is S (disallowed).  
- “CUSKS” – same.  

Example: _ _ S _ _  
- “DUSKS” – S in 3, U in 2. Letters: D, U, S, K, S – S repeats and 5 is S (disallowed).  
- “FUSKS” – same.  

Example: _ _ _ S _  
- “LUNGS” – S in 4, U in 2. Letters: L, U, N, G, S – no repeats, S in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed).  
  – Check positions: S not in 1 or 5 (ok in 4), U not in 3 (ok in 2).  
  – No banned letters.  

“LUNGS” seems valid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these without repeating letters. Common strong starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"".

- STINK (S, T, I, N, K) – no A, R, O, E, S in position 1.
- STUMP, SLING, STINK are all good options.

I'll choose STUMP as it uses very common letters and positions S at the start.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T, M, P are now ruled out.  
   – S is not in position 1.  
   – U is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word contains S and U.  
- S is not in position 1 or 5.  
- U is not in position 3.  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, M, P.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, D, G, H, K, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed, and A, O, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and U.  
- S not in positions 1 or 5.  
- U not in position 3.  
- No A, R, O, E, T, M, P.

Possible patterns for S: positions 2, 3, or 4.  
Possible patterns for U: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- S _ _ _ _ or _ S _ _ _ or _ _ S _ _  
- U in any allowed position.

Candidate: “NUSKY” – but Y is less common and K is okay.  
Another: “DUSKY” – D and K are good letters.  
Another: “HUSKS” – H, U, S, K, S – but S repeats and position 5 is disallowed for S.  
Another: “LUNGS” – L, U, N, G, S – positions: S in 5 (disallowed), so no.  
Another: “FUNDS” – F, U, N, D, S – positions: S in 5 (disallowed).  
Another: “SUNNY” – S in 1 (disallowed).  
Another: “LUNGS” already rejected.  
Another: “DUNGS” – S in 5 (disallowed).  
Another: “LUNGS” again.

Wait, let’s try “LUNGS” again: S is in 5, which is disallowed.  
So we need S in 2, 3, or 4.

How about “NUSKS” – S in 4, U in 2. Letters: N, U, S, K, S – S repeats and position 5 is S (disallowed).  

“DUSKS” – same issue with S in 5.  

“FUSKS” – same.  

“LUNDS” – not a word.  

“LUNGS” – S in 5, no.  

“LUNDS” – not valid.  

“LUNGS” – again S in 5.  

Let me think differently: S must be in 2, 3, or 4.  

Example: _ S _ _ _  
- “BUSKS” – B, U, S, K, S – S repeats and 5 is S (disallowed).  
- “CUSKS” – same.  

Example: _ _ S _ _  
- “DUSKS” – S in 3, U in 2. Letters: D, U, S, K, S – S repeats and 5 is S (disallowed).  
- “FUSKS” – same.  

Example: _ _ _ S _  
- “LUNGS” – S in 4, U in 2. Letters: L, U, N, G, S – no repeats, S in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed).  
  – Check positions: S not in 1 or 5 (ok in 4), U not in 3 (ok in 2).  
  – No banned letters.  

“LUNGS” seems valid.

Another candidate: “LUNDS” – not a word.  
“LUNGS” is the only valid word I see that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LUNGS.

We need a 5-letter word that:

Actually, the word must have S only in position 5, not elsewhere. So looking for words like _ U _ _ S with no repeats and no banned letters.

No banned letters used, and no repeats. This seems valid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these without repeating letters. Common strong starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the word:
- Contains S (but not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Letters left to consider (common ones): T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Possible candidates:
- STUMP (S, T, U, M, P) – S in position 1.
- SLING (but has A? No, A is out, but L is ok) – but L is ok, but we need to avoid A, R, O, E.
Wait, SLING has no A, R, O, E, and S is in position 1. But does it have duplicates? No. So SLING is possible.
- SNOUT (S, N, O, U, T) – but O is out.

Actually, the word must have S only in position 5, not elsewhere. So looking for words like _ U _ _ S with no repeats and no banned letters.

Possible words:
- DUSKY (D, U, S, K, Y) - but S is in 5, K and Y are ok, D is ok
- HUSKY (H, U, S, K, Y) - same as above
- FUSKY (F, U, S, K, Y) - same
- BUSKY (B, U, S, K, Y) - same
- WUSKY (not a word)

Among these, ""DUSKY"" seems like the most common word.

Let me check:
- D: not banned
- U: in position 2 (matches ✓)
- S: in position 5 (matches ✓)
- K: not banned
- Y: not banned

No banned letters used, and no repeats. This seems valid.Based on the feedback:
- U is confirmed in position 2
- S is confirmed in position 5
- All other letters in the word are from the remaining pool

A valid word fitting this pattern is DUSKY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Confirmed positions:

Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere):
- K (✓) – from DUSKY, K is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, M, P, L, N, G, D, Y

So the pattern is:
_ U _ _ S
with an additional requirement that K appears somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 3, or 4), and no repeats of any letter.

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, H, I, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2
- Has S in position 5
- Contains K exactly once, not in position 4
- Uses only the available letters

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K U _ _ S
- Position 3: _ U K _ S
- Position 4: _ U _ K S  (but feedback says K is not in position 4) → invalid

So K must be in position 1 or 3.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these without repeating letters. Common strong starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the word:
- Contains S (but not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Letters left to consider (common ones): T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

We need a 5-letter word with S somewhere (positions 1-4), and avoiding A, R, O, E.

Possible candidates:
- STUMP (S, T, U, M, P) – S in position 1.
- SLING (but has A? No, A is out, but L is ok) – but L is ok, but we need to avoid A, R, O, E.
Wait, SLING has no A, R, O, E, and S is in position 1. But does it have duplicates? No. So SLING is possible.
- SNOUT (S, N, O, U, T) – but O is out.
- STINK (S, T, I, N, K) – no A, R, O, E, S in position 1.
- STUMP, SLING, STINK are all good options.

I'll choose STUMP as it uses very common letters and positions S at the start.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T, M, P are now ruled out.  
   – S is not in position 1.  
   – U is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word contains S and U.  
- S is not in position 1 or 5.  
- U is not in position 3.  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, M, P.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, D, G, H, K, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed, and A, O, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and U.  
- S not in positions 1 or 5.  
- U not in position 3.  
- No A, R, O, E, T, M, P.

Possible patterns for S: positions 2, 3, or 4.  
Possible patterns for U: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- S _ _ _ _ or _ S _ _ _ or _ _ S _ _  
- U in any allowed position.

Candidate: “NUSKY” – but Y is less common and K is okay.  
Another: “DUSKY” – D and K are good letters.  
Another: “HUSKS” – H, U, S, K, S – but S repeats and position 5 is disallowed for S.  
Another: “LUNGS” – L, U, N, G, S – positions: S in 5 (disallowed), so no.  
Another: “FUNDS” – F, U, N, D, S – positions: S in 5 (disallowed).  
Another: “SUNNY” – S in 1 (disallowed).  
Another: “LUNGS” already rejected.  
Another: “DUNGS” – S in 5 (disallowed).  
Another: “LUNGS” again.

Wait, let’s try “LUNGS” again: S is in 5, which is disallowed.  
So we need S in 2, 3, or 4.

How about “NUSKS” – S in 4, U in 2. Letters: N, U, S, K, S – S repeats and position 5 is S (disallowed).  

“DUSKS” – same issue with S in 5.  

“FUSKS” – same.  

“LUNDS” – not a word.  

“LUNGS” – S in 5, no.  

“LUNDS” – not valid.  

“LUNGS” – again S in 5.  

Let me think differently: S must be in 2, 3, or 4.  

Example: _ S _ _ _  
- “BUSKS” – B, U, S, K, S – S repeats and 5 is S (disallowed).  
- “CUSKS” – same.  

Example: _ _ S _ _  
- “DUSKS” – S in 3, U in 2. Letters: D, U, S, K, S – S repeats and 5 is S (disallowed).  
- “FUSKS” – same.  

Example: _ _ _ S _  
- “LUNGS” – S in 4, U in 2. Letters: L, U, N, G, S – no repeats, S in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed).  
  – Check positions: S not in 1 or 5 (ok in 4), U not in 3 (ok in 2).  
  – No banned letters.  

“LUNGS” seems valid.

Another candidate: “LUNDS” – not a word.  
“LUNGS” is the only valid word I see that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LUNGS.

From all feedback so far:

Letters we now know are in the word and their positions:
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, E, T, M, P, L, N, G

So the pattern is: _ U _ _ S

Remaining letters to consider (common ones not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, H, I, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2
- Has S in position 5
- Uses none of the banned letters
- Uses only remaining letters

Possible candidates:
- BUSSY (but S repeats and Y is less common)
- DUSSY (same)
- FUSSY (same)
- HUSKS (but K is ok, S repeats)
- WUSKS (not a word)
- CUSHY (Y is ok, but S repeats)
- DUSHY (S repeats)
- FUSKY (Y is ok, but S repeats)
- HUSKY (Y is ok, but S repeats)
- WUSKY (not a word)
- DUSKY (Y is ok, but S is in 5 and K is ok, but D is ok)

Wait, let me think of words with U in position 2 and S in position 5 without repeating letters.

Looking at _ U _ _ S:

- BUSHY (but S is in 4, not 5)
- DUSKY (S in 5, but K is ok, D is ok, Y is ok)
- FUSKY (F, U, S, K, Y) - S in 5, but S is already in 5 from feedback, and this would have S in 3 as well (invalid)
- HUSKY (H, U, S, K, Y) - S in 5, but S is already in 5 from feedback, and this would have S in 3 as well (invalid)

Actually, the word must have S only in position 5, not elsewhere. So looking for words like _ U _ _ S with no repeats and no banned letters.

Possible words:
- DUSKY (D, U, S, K, Y) - but S is in 5, K and Y are ok, D is ok
- HUSKY (H, U, S, K, Y) - same as above
- FUSKY (F, U, S, K, Y) - same
- BUSKY (B, U, S, K, Y) - same
- WUSKY (not a word)

Among these, ""DUSKY"" seems like the most common word.

Let me check:
- D: not banned
- U: in position 2 (matches ✓)
- S: in position 5 (matches ✓)
- K: not banned
- Y: not banned

No banned letters used, and no repeats. This seems valid.Based on the feedback:
- U is confirmed in position 2
- S is confirmed in position 5
- All other letters in the word are from the remaining pool

A valid word fitting this pattern is DUSKY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere):
- K (✓) – from DUSKY, K is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, M, P, L, N, G, D, Y

So the pattern is:
_ U _ _ S
with an additional requirement that K appears somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 3, or 4), and no repeats of any letter.

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, H, I, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2
- Has S in position 5
- Contains K exactly once, not in position 4
- Uses only the available letters

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K U _ _ S
- Position 3: _ U K _ S
- Position 4: _ U _ K S  (but feedback says K is not in position 4) → invalid

So K must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list valid words:

1. K U _ _ S
   - KUSHY – but Y is ruled out
   - KURKS – not a word
   - KUBIS – not a word
   - KURDS – D is ruled out
   - KUSKS – S repeats and K repeats, invalid
   - KURKS – invalid
   - KURDS – D invalid
   - KUSHI – H, I available → KUSHI

2. _ U K _ S
   - BUKIS – not a word
   - CUKIS – not a word
   - FUKIS – not a word
   - HUKIS – not a word
   - WUKIS – not a word
   - No common words here

The only valid candidate is KUSHI.

Check:
- K: position 1 (allowed)
- U: position 2 (matches ✓)
- S: position 5 (matches ✓)
- H: available
- I: available
- No banned letters
- No repeats

Let's update what we now know after the fifth guess.

1. Confirmed positions:
   - Position 2: U (✓) – from every guess since the start.

2. Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere in the word):
   - K – from DUSKY, it is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S – from the very first guess, it is in the word but not in position 5 (because it got “-” instead of “✓” in LUNGS and again in KUSHI).  
     However, in Guess 3 (LUNGS) S was marked ✓ in position 5, which seems contradictory.  
     Re-reading carefully: in LUNGS the feedback was L(x) U(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓), so S was ✓ in position 5.  
     But in KUSHI the feedback was K(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) I(x), meaning S is NOT in position 3 and NOT in position 5.  
     This creates a conflict because earlier S was ✓ in position 5 (LUNGS) but now in KUSHI S is marked (-) for position 5.  
     The only way both can be true is if the secret word has S in position 5 and also somewhere else, but that’s impossible in a 5-letter word.  
     Therefore, the feedback from KUSHI must be interpreted as S being in the word but not in position 3, and the earlier ✓ in position 5 from LUNGS must mean S is indeed in position 5.  
     So S is in position 5 (✓), and the “-” in KUSHI simply confirms it’s not in position 3.

3. Confirmed letters (must appear):
   - K – not in position 4 (from DUSKY)
   - S – in position 5 (from LUNGS)
   - U – in position 2 (from LUNGS, DUSKY, KUSHI)

4. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   A, R, O, E, T, M, P, L, N, G, D, Y, H, I

5. Pattern so far:
   _ U _ _ S
   with K somewhere in positions 1, 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).

6. Available letters (not yet ruled out):
   B, C, F, Q, V, W, X, Z

7. Possible positions for K:
   - Position 1: K U _ _ S
   - Position 3: _ U K _ S

Let’s list valid words:

a) K U _ _ S
   - KURKS – invalid (repeats K, R banned)
   - KUBIS – invalid (I banned)
   - KURDS – D banned
   - KUSKS – repeats S and K, invalid
   - KURKS – invalid
   - KURDS – invalid
   - KUSHY – Y banned
   - KUSKI – I banned
   - KURKS – invalid
   - KURDS – invalid
   - No valid words here.

b) _ U K _ S
   - BUKIS – invalid (I banned)
   - CUKIS – invalid (I banned)
   - FUKIS – invalid (I banned)
   - HUKIS – H banned
   - WUKIS – invalid (I banned)
   - No valid words here either.

Wait, let me double-check the available letters. From the banned list above, the remaining letters are: B, C, F, Q, V, W, X, Z.

So for _ U K _ S, the first and fourth positions must be from B, C, F, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- B U K C S – is BUKCS a word? No.
- C U K B S – no.
- F U K B S – no.
- V U K B S – no.
- W U K B S – no.
- Z U K B S – no.
- Similarly, no valid English word fits _ U K _ S with these letters.

This suggests the only possible placement is K in position 1, but we saw no valid words. However, I overlooked:

K U _ _ S with available letters:
- K U B _ S – need a fourth letter. Available: B, C, F, Q, V, W, X, Z.
   - KUBCS – no.
   - KUBFS – no.
   - KUBVS – no.

   - KUFFS – repeats F, but F is allowed. Is KUFFS a word? Yes, it’s the plural of “kuff” (a dialectal term for a thimble or small tube). However, it’s obscure.  
   - KUFFS – valid in Scrabble dictionaries.

Given the constraints, KUFFS is the only plausible candidate.

Check:
- K: position 1 (allowed, not in position 4)
- U: position 2 (matches ✓)
- F: position 3 (allowed)
- F: position 4 (allowed, F not banned)
- S: position 5 (matches ✓)
- No banned letters
- No repeats except F, which is allowed

Therefore, the next guess must be KUFFS.
