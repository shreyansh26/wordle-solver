1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere except position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Common letters still available: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, W, V, J, X, Q, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these plus the S. A good candidate is “SULKY”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S can’t be in position 4).
- Uses U, L, K, Y which are all still possible.

Another option is “STUMP” but P is less common. “SULKY” seems better for coverage.

Known so far:
- Word pattern: _ U _ _ _ (U fixed in position 2).  
- Must contain S and L, but S ≠ pos 1,4 and L ≠ pos 3.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, K, Y.

We need a 5-letter word fitting:

- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S cannot be 1 or 4 → must be 3 or 5.  
- L cannot be 3 → must be 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try S in position 3 and L in position 5: _ U S _ L.  
A word like “BUSIL” doesn’t exist.  
Try S in 5 and L in 1: L U _ _ S.  
A word like “LUNGS” fits: L U N G S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere except position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Common letters still available: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, W, V, J, X, Q, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these plus the S. A good candidate is “SULKY”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S can’t be in position 4).
- Uses U, L, K, Y which are all still possible.

Another option is “STUMP” but P is less common. “SULKY” seems better for coverage.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – A, R, O, E are absent.

2. SULKY → S(-) U(✓) L(-) K(x) Y(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – U is in the word and in position 2.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – K and Y are absent.

Known so far:
- Word pattern: _ U _ _ _ (U fixed in position 2).  
- Must contain S and L, but S ≠ pos 1,4 and L ≠ pos 3.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, K, Y.

Available letters (common ones): S, L, T, I, N, C, D, H, M, G, B, F, P, W, V.

We need a 5-letter word fitting:
- _ U _ _ _  
- Contains S and L (in allowed positions).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S cannot be 1 or 4 → must be 3 or 5.  
- L cannot be 3 → must be 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try S in position 3 and L in position 5: _ U S _ L.  
A word like “BUSIL” doesn’t exist.  
Try S in 5 and L in 1: L U _ _ S.  
A word like “LUNGS” fits: L U N G S.  
Check letters: L, U, N, G, S – all allowed, no forbidden ones.  
Also, positions:  
- S in 5 (allowed, since S ≠ 1,4).  
- L in 1 (allowed, since L ≠ 3).  
- U in 2 (fixed).  
- N and G are new, but that’s fine.

So “LUNGS” is a valid next guess.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ U _ _ S (U fixed at 2, S fixed at 5).

- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G.  
- Allowed letters left: S (already used), L, U (already used), plus T, I, C, D, H, M, B, F, P, W, V.

So the word must be: _ U _ L S.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? U ? L S.

Common English words fitting this:
- BULKS – but K is forbidden.  
- DULLS – but L is already in position 4, and second L would duplicate.  
- FULLS – but L is already in position 4, and second L would duplicate.

- PULPS – P is allowed, and no forbidden letters.  
- TULLS – same duplication as DULLS.  
- VULNS – not a common word.  
- WULKS – K is forbidden.  

The only common word without forbidden letters is PULPS.

Check letters: P, U, L, P, S.  
- P is allowed.  
- U is allowed.  
- L is allowed (in position 4).  
- S is allowed (in position 5).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Known letters:
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- The only remaining spot for L is position 1.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P.

So the pattern must be: L U _ _ S, with the two blanks filled from the still-allowed letters:
{B, C, D, F, H, I, M, T, V, W, X, Z} (excluding the forbidden ones and the used U, L, S).

We need a common English word of the form L U ? ? S.

Common candidates:
- LUMPS – P is forbidden.
- LURKS – R, K forbidden.
- LUSTS – T is allowed, second S is already at end, so L U S T S – but that’s not a valid word.
- LUNGS – N, G forbidden.
- LULUS – not a common word.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.
- LUTHS – not a word.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically:

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, H, I, M, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word: L U _ _ S.

Possible combinations:
- L U B _ S: LUBES – E forbidden. LUBIS – not a word. LUBBS – not common.
- L U C _ S: LUCID – too long. LUCKS – K, C allowed but K forbidden.
- L U D _ S: LUDOS – O forbidden. LUDUS – not common.
- L U F _ S: LUFTH – not a word.
- L U H _ S: LUTHS – not a word.
- L U I _ S: LUISS – not a word.
- L U M _ S: LUMPS – P forbidden.
- L U T _ S: LUTIS – not a word. LUTHS – not a word. LUTOS – O forbidden.
- L U V _ S: LUVAS – A forbidden. LUVIS – not a word.
- L U W _ S: L W _ S – nothing obvious.
- L U X _ S: LUXES – E forbidden. LUXIS – not a word.
- L U Z _ S: L U Z _ S – nothing obvious.

Hmm, seems like most combinations either use forbidden letters or aren’t valid words. Let me double-check:

- LUMPS – P is forbidden (from PULPS feedback).
- LUCKS – K is forbidden.
- LURKS – R, K forbidden.
- LUNGS – N, G forbidden.
- LUSTS – T allowed, but second S would duplicate, and it’s not a standard word.
- LULUS – not a word.
- LUTHS – not a word.

Wait, let me check LUSTS again: L U S T S. It’s a valid word meaning “to lust.” It uses:
- L (position 1) – allowed.
- U (position 2) – allowed.
- S (position 3) – allowed (S can be anywhere except 1,4).
- T (position 4) – allowed.
- S (position 5) – allowed.

Forbidden letters: none of A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P appear. So LUSTS is valid.

Another candidate: LUMPS – P is forbidden. LUCKS – K forbidden. LURKS – R, K forbidden. LUNGS – N, G forbidden. So LUSTS seems the only common one left.

Therefore, the next guess is LUSTS.
</think>

<guess>LUSTS</guess>",LUSTS,"From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Known letters:
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- The only remaining spot for L is position 1.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P.

So the pattern must be: L U _ _ S, with the two blanks filled from the still-allowed letters:
{B, C, D, F, H, I, M, T, V, W, X, Z} (excluding the forbidden ones and the used U, L, S).

We need a common English word of the form L U ? ? S.

Common candidates:
- LUMPS – P is forbidden.
- LURKS – R, K forbidden.
- LUSTS – T is allowed, second S is already at end, so L U S T S – but that’s not a valid word.
- LUNGS – N, G forbidden.
- LULUS – not a common word.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.
- LUTHS – not a word.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically:

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, H, I, M, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word: L U _ _ S.

Possible combinations:
- L U B _ S: LUBES – E forbidden. LUBIS – not a word. LUBBS – not common.
- L U C _ S: LUCID – too long. LUCKS – K, C allowed but K forbidden.
- L U D _ S: LUDOS – O forbidden. LUDUS – not common.
- L U F _ S: LUFTH – not a word.
- L U H _ S: LUTHS – not a word.
- L U I _ S: LUISS – not a word.

- L U T _ S: LUTIS – not a word. LUTHS – not a word. LUTOS – O forbidden.
- L U V _ S: LUVAS – A forbidden. LUVIS – not a word.
- L U W _ S: L W _ S – nothing obvious.
- L U X _ S: LUXES – E forbidden. LUXIS – not a word.
- L U Z _ S: L U Z _ S – nothing obvious.

Hmm, seems like most combinations either use forbidden letters or aren’t valid words. Let me double-check:

- LUMPS – P is forbidden (from PULPS feedback).
- LUCKS – K is forbidden.
- LURKS – R, K forbidden.
- LUNGS – N, G forbidden.
- LUSTS – T allowed, but second S would duplicate, and it’s not a standard word.
- LULUS – not a word.
- LUTHS – not a word.

Wait, let me check LUSTS again: L U S T S. It’s a valid word meaning “to lust.” It uses:
- L (position 1) – allowed.
- U (position 2) – allowed.
- S (position 3) – allowed (S can be anywhere except 1,4).
- T (position 4) – allowed.
- S (position 5) – allowed.

Forbidden letters: none of A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P appear. So LUSTS is valid.

Another candidate: LUMPS – P is forbidden. LUCKS – K forbidden. LURKS – R, K forbidden. LUNGS – N, G forbidden. So LUSTS seems the only common one left.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere except position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Common letters still available: T, I, N, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, P, W, V, J, X, Q, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these plus the S. A good candidate is “SULKY”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S can’t be in position 4).
- Uses U, L, K, Y which are all still possible.

Another option is “STUMP” but P is less common. “SULKY” seems better for coverage.

Guess 2: SULKY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – A, R, O, E are absent.

2. SULKY → S(-) U(✓) L(-) K(x) Y(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – U is in the word and in position 2.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – K and Y are absent.

Known so far:
- Word pattern: _ U _ _ _ (U fixed in position 2).  
- Must contain S and L, but S ≠ pos 1,4 and L ≠ pos 3.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, K, Y.

Available letters (common ones): S, L, T, I, N, C, D, H, M, G, B, F, P, W, V.

We need a 5-letter word fitting:
- _ U _ _ _  
- Contains S and L (in allowed positions).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S cannot be 1 or 4 → must be 3 or 5.  
- L cannot be 3 → must be 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try S in position 3 and L in position 5: _ U S _ L.  
A word like “BUSIL” doesn’t exist.  
Try S in 5 and L in 1: L U _ _ S.  
A word like “LUNGS” fits: L U N G S.  
Check letters: L, U, N, G, S – all allowed, no forbidden ones.  
Also, positions:  
- S in 5 (allowed, since S ≠ 1,4).  
- L in 1 (allowed, since L ≠ 3).  
- U in 2 (fixed).  
- N and G are new, but that’s fine.

So “LUNGS” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. SULKY → S(-) U(✓) L(-) K(x) Y(x)  
   – U is in position 2.  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 1.  
   – L is in the word, but not in position 3.  
   – K and Y are absent.

3. LUNGS → L(-) U(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)  
   – L is in the word, but not in position 1.  
   – U is confirmed in position 2.  
   – S is confirmed in position 5.  
   – N and G are absent.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ U _ _ S (U fixed at 2, S fixed at 5).  
- Must contain L, and L is not in positions 1 or 3.  
  – Therefore L must be in position 4.  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G.  
- Allowed letters left: S (already used), L, U (already used), plus T, I, C, D, H, M, B, F, P, W, V.

So the word must be: _ U _ L S.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? U ? L S.

Common English words fitting this:
- BULKS – but K is forbidden.  
- DULLS – but L is already in position 4, and second L would duplicate.  
- FULLS – but L is already in position 4, and second L would duplicate.  
- HULLS – same duplication issue.  
- PULPS – P is allowed, and no forbidden letters.  
- TULLS – same duplication as DULLS.  
- VULNS – not a common word.  
- WULKS – K is forbidden.  

The only common word without forbidden letters is PULPS.

Check letters: P, U, L, P, S.  
- P is allowed.  
- U is allowed.  
- L is allowed (in position 4).  
- S is allowed (in position 5).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore, the next logical guess is PULPS.

From all feedback so far:

- Position 5: S (✓)

Known letters:
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- The only remaining spot for L is position 1.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P.

So the pattern must be: L U _ _ S, with the two blanks filled from the still-allowed letters:
{B, C, D, F, H, I, M, T, V, W, X, Z} (excluding the forbidden ones and the used U, L, S).

We need a common English word of the form L U ? ? S.

Common candidates:
- LUMPS – P is forbidden.
- LURKS – R, K forbidden.
- LUSTS – T is allowed, second S is already at end, so L U S T S – but that’s not a valid word.
- LUNGS – N, G forbidden.
- LULUS – not a common word.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.
- LUTHS – not a word.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.
- LUMPS – P forbidden.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically:

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, H, I, M, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word: L U _ _ S.

Possible combinations:
- L U B _ S: LUBES – E forbidden. LUBIS – not a word. LUBBS – not common.
- L U C _ S: LUCID – too long. LUCKS – K, C allowed but K forbidden.
- L U D _ S: LUDOS – O forbidden. LUDUS – not common.
- L U F _ S: LUFTH – not a word.
- L U H _ S: LUTHS – not a word.
- L U I _ S: LUISS – not a word.
- L U M _ S: LUMPS – P forbidden.
- L U T _ S: LUTIS – not a word. LUTHS – not a word. LUTOS – O forbidden.
- L U V _ S: LUVAS – A forbidden. LUVIS – not a word.
- L U W _ S: L W _ S – nothing obvious.
- L U X _ S: LUXES – E forbidden. LUXIS – not a word.
- L U Z _ S: L U Z _ S – nothing obvious.

Hmm, seems like most combinations either use forbidden letters or aren’t valid words. Let me double-check:

- LUMPS – P is forbidden (from PULPS feedback).
- LUCKS – K is forbidden.
- LURKS – R, K forbidden.
- LUNGS – N, G forbidden.
- LUSTS – T allowed, but second S would duplicate, and it’s not a standard word.
- LULUS – not a word.
- LUTHS – not a word.

Wait, let me check LUSTS again: L U S T S. It’s a valid word meaning “to lust.” It uses:
- L (position 1) – allowed.
- U (position 2) – allowed.
- S (position 3) – allowed (S can be anywhere except 1,4).
- T (position 4) – allowed.
- S (position 5) – allowed.

Forbidden letters: none of A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P appear. So LUSTS is valid.

Another candidate: LUMPS – P is forbidden. LUCKS – K forbidden. LURKS – R, K forbidden. LUNGS – N, G forbidden. So LUSTS seems the only common one left.

Therefore, the next guess is LUSTS.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Known positions:
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Known letters:
- L is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in LUSTS it was in position 1 and marked “-”).
  – The only remaining spot for L is position 3.

- S is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in LUSTS it was in position 3 and marked “-”).
  – However, position 5 is already confirmed S (✓).  
  – This creates a contradiction: S cannot be in position 5 if it is also not allowed in position 3, and there is no other position left for S.  
  – Re-examining the feedback: in LUSTS, the third letter was S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. Position 5 is confirmed S(✓). So S can still only be in position 5, which is already satisfied. The earlier restriction for S is still “not in position 4” from AROSE. Therefore, S is only fixed in position 5.

- T is not in the word (from LUSTS feedback: T(x)).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, K, Y, N, G, P, T.

Current pattern:
- Position 2: U
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: must be L (only remaining spot for L)
- Positions 1 and 4: must be filled from allowed letters: {B, C, D, F, H, I, M, V, W, X, Z} (excluding forbidden ones).

So the word must be: ? U L ? S.

We need a common English word of the form ? U L ? S.

Possible candidates:
- BULKS – K forbidden.
- CULMS – C, U, L, M, S. All allowed letters. Check: C, U, L, M, S – none are forbidden. This fits perfectly.
- DULCS – not a word.
- FULMS – not a word.
- HULMS – not a word.
- MULCS – not a word.
- VULMS – not a word.

The only common word fitting is CULMS.

Check letters: C, U, L, M, S – none are in the forbidden list. Positions:
- 1: C (allowed)
- 2: U (fixed)
- 3: L (must be here)
- 4: M (allowed)
- 5: S (fixed)

No contradictions. Therefore, CULMS is the correct guess.
