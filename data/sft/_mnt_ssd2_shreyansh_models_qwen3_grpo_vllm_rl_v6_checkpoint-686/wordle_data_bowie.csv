2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words, making it a strong first guess. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words, making it a strong first guess. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CHIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓)

From the new feedback on CHIME:
- E is still correct in position 5.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, or 4).
- C, H, M are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains the letter I (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, H, M.

Remaining consonants to test: R, N, D, B, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (I is already confirmed, A is out).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of common 5-letter words ending in E with I not in position 3, and avoiding all forbidden letters:
- RINSE (but S is forbidden)
- DINGE (but N is okay, but D, I, N, G, E - all allowed)
- PINE (but needs 5 letters)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - but M was already tested and is out, but BRINE doesn't have M - actually this is okay, but we already considered this)
- PRIZE (but Z is uncommon and S is out)
- RIGID (but ends with D)
- BRIEF (B, R, I, E, F - all allowed, and F is a new consonant to test)

""BRIEF"" seems good:
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains I in position 3 (but feedback said I is in wrong position, so this would be bad - wait, no: in CHIME, I was in position 3 and marked as wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3. Thus BRIEF would place I in position 3 again - that's invalid.)

Let me reconsider:
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, M.
- Need 5-letter words ending in E with I in 1, 2, or 4.

Possible candidates:
- IRONE (I in 1, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- DRIED (but ends with D)
- PRIDE (P, R, I, D, E - I in 3 again - no good)
- BRIEF (I in 3 - no good)
- URINE (U, R, I, N, E - I in 3 - no good)
- FRISE (S is out)
- GRIPE (P, but ends with E - G, R, I, P, E - I in 3 - no good)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - I in 3 - no good)

Hmm, seems like many common words place I in position 3 which we know is wrong. Let me try words where I is in position 1 or 2 or 4.

- IRONY (but ends with Y, not E)
- IRATE (A is out)
- INURE (U, but ends with E - I, N, U, R, E - I in 1, N in 2, U in 3, R in 4, E in 5 - this seems valid)
- INURE: I in 1 (allowed), N in 2, U in 3, R in 4, E in 5. No forbidden letters. This looks good.

Another option:
- IRONE: I in 1, R in 2, O in 3, N in 4, E in 5. No forbidden letters. Also good.

Between INURE and IRONE, IRONE seems more common and tests R and O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words, making it a strong first guess. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, D, M, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let me think of common words ending in E that avoid S, L, A, T:
- CRIME (but has I and M, but M is okay)
- PRONE (but has P, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E - all allowed)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - all allowed)
- DRONE (D, R, O, N, E - all allowed)

""CHIME"" seems good because it uses C, H, I, M, E - none of which are forbidden, and it tests new common letters (C, H, I, M).

- GRIPE (P, but ends with E - G, R, I, P, E - I in 3 - no good)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - I in 3 - no good)

Hmm, seems like many common words place I in position 3 which we know is wrong. Let me try words where I is in position 1 or 2 or 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words, making it a strong first guess. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, D, M, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let me think of common words ending in E that avoid S, L, A, T:
- CRIME (but has I and M, but M is okay)
- PRONE (but has P, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E - all allowed)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - all allowed)
- DRONE (D, R, O, N, E - all allowed)

""CHIME"" seems good because it uses C, H, I, M, E - none of which are forbidden, and it tests new common letters (C, H, I, M).

Guess 2: CHIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHIME:
- E is still correct in position 5.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, or 4).
- C, H, M are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains the letter I (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, H, M.

Remaining consonants to test: R, N, D, B, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (I is already confirmed, A is out).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of common 5-letter words ending in E with I not in position 3, and avoiding all forbidden letters:
- RINSE (but S is forbidden)
- DINGE (but N is okay, but D, I, N, G, E - all allowed)
- PINE (but needs 5 letters)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - but M was already tested and is out, but BRINE doesn't have M - actually this is okay, but we already considered this)
- PRIZE (but Z is uncommon and S is out)
- RIGID (but ends with D)
- BRIEF (B, R, I, E, F - all allowed, and F is a new consonant to test)

""BRIEF"" seems good:
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains I in position 3 (but feedback said I is in wrong position, so this would be bad - wait, no: in CHIME, I was in position 3 and marked as wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3. Thus BRIEF would place I in position 3 again - that's invalid.)

Let me reconsider:
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, M.
- Need 5-letter words ending in E with I in 1, 2, or 4.

Possible candidates:
- IRONE (I in 1, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- DRIED (but ends with D)
- PRIDE (P, R, I, D, E - I in 3 again - no good)
- BRIEF (I in 3 - no good)
- URINE (U, R, I, N, E - I in 3 - no good)
- FRISE (S is out)
- GRIPE (P, but ends with E - G, R, I, P, E - I in 3 - no good)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E - I in 3 - no good)

Hmm, seems like many common words place I in position 3 which we know is wrong. Let me try words where I is in position 1 or 2 or 4.

- IRONY (but ends with Y, not E)
- IRATE (A is out)
- INURE (U, but ends with E - I, N, U, R, E - I in 1, N in 2, U in 3, R in 4, E in 5 - this seems valid)
- INURE: I in 1 (allowed), N in 2, U in 3, R in 4, E in 5. No forbidden letters. This looks good.

Another option:
- IRONE: I in 1, R in 2, O in 3, N in 4, E in 5. No forbidden letters. Also good.

Between INURE and IRONE, IRONE seems more common and tests R and O.

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- Contains I, but I is NOT in positions 1, 3 (from IRONE feedback: I was in 1 and marked wrong position, so I must be in 2 or 4).
- Contains O (from IRONE feedback: O was marked wrong position, so O is in the word but not in position 3).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, M, R, N.

Remaining consonants to test: D, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O are out, E is fixed, I is confirmed, so U is left).

Possible positions:
- I must be in 2 or 4.
- O must be in 1, 2, 4 (since it was in 3 and marked wrong).
- U is possible in remaining spots.

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in E with:
- I in 2 or 4
- O in 1, 2, or 4
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, C, H, M, R, N)
- No duplicate letters we haven't tested yet.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ O E  (but O can't be in 3, and E is 5)
- _ O _ I E
- O _ I _ E
- I _ O _ E (but I can't be in 1)
- _ I O _ E (but O can't be in 3)
- _ _ I O E
- _ O _ _ E with I somewhere

Let's try:
- D O I L E (but L is forbidden)
- P O I U E (but U is allowed, but P, O, I, U, E - but this ends with E, has I in 3 (forbidden), so no)
- P O U I E (but I is in 4, O in 2, U in 3 - all allowed)
- P O U I E: P, O, U, I, E - all letters allowed, no forbidden ones, and it fits:
  - E in 5 (confirmed)
  - I in 4 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - U in 3 (allowed)
  - P in 1 (new letter to test)

This seems like a good next guess.

Pattern:  ?   O   ?   I   E

And we have eliminated the following letters:
S, L, A, T, C, H, M, R, N, P, U, D, G

Remaining consonants that can still appear in positions 1 or 3:
B, F, K, V, W, Y

We need a common 5-letter English word that fits the pattern _ O _ I E using only those consonants in the blanks.

Let's test the remaining consonants:

- B O ? I E → BOBIE (not a word), BOWIE (valid word, uses W which is allowed)
- F O ? I E → FOGIE (valid word, uses G but G was already eliminated in DOGIE feedback)
- K O ? I E → KOIE? (no valid word)
- V O ? I E → VOILE (invalid, contains L)
- W O ? I E → WOIE? (no valid word)

The only valid remaining word is BOWIE, which uses B and W (both still allowed).
