### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.

- O(x) – O is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but not A, O, or E.
- R cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps R and S in different positions from before.
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (since A, O, E are out, we’ll try I, U, and common consonants like T, N, L, D).
3. Avoids any of the already-eliminated letters (A, O, E).

A balanced choice is “TRIPS”:
- T is a common consonant we haven’t tested.
- R is moved to position 1 (was in position 2 before).
- I is a new vowel.
- P is another common consonant.
- S is moved to position 5 (was in position 4 before).

This should help narrow down positions for R and S and test new letters.

Current facts:
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, U  
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, E, T, I, P, C, H  

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: cannot be 1, 2, 3 (from TRIPS and CRUSH) → must be 4 or 5
- S: cannot be 3, 4, 5 (from AROSE, TRIPS, CRUSH) → must be 1 or 2
- U: cannot be 3 (from CRUSH) → must be 1, 2, 4, or 5, but must avoid positions already taken by S or R

So the word must look like:
- If S is in 1: S _ _ R _ or S _ _ _ R
- If S is in 2: _ S _ R _ or _ S _ _ R

We still need to test common unguessed letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, Y, etc.

Let’s try “SURFY”:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- R in 4 (allowed)
- F and Y are new letters
This tests 3 new letters (F, Y) plus the placement of S and U.
