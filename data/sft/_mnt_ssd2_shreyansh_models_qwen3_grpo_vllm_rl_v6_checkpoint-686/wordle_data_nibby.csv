### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and covering a good range of vowels and consonants. A classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I should avoid those letters entirely and choose a word built from the remaining 21 letters.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses five completely different letters (none from AROSE).
2. Contains common letters that weren’t ruled out, such as T, N, I, L, U, C, D, etc.
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

A balanced choice is “UNTIL”:
- U (vowel)

- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K  
- N is not in positions 2 or 4.  
- I is not in positions 3 or 4.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N and I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I.  
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters.  
- Places N in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
- Places I in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s look for such a word.  
A good candidate is “BINGO”:
- B, G are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

However, “BINGO” uses O, which was eliminated in AROSE.  
Next candidate: “PINNY”:
- P, Y are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in positions 3 and 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

But “PINNY” has two N’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.  
Another candidate: “DINGY”:
- D, G, Y are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

This seems like a strong choice.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and covering a good range of vowels and consonants. A classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I should avoid those letters entirely and choose a word built from the remaining 21 letters.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses five completely different letters (none from AROSE).
2. Contains common letters that weren’t ruled out, such as T, N, I, L, U, C, D, etc.
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

A balanced choice is “UNTIL”:
- U (vowel)
- N, T (common consonants)
- I (vowel)
- L (common consonant)

None of these letters were in AROSE, so they’re all still possible.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I.  
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters.  
- Places N somewhere other than position 2.  
- Places I somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s look for such a word.  
A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates A, R, O, S, E.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates U, T, L.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. CHINK → C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates C, H, K.  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: N, I  
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K  
- N is not in positions 2 or 4.  
- I is not in positions 3 or 4.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N and I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I.  
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters.  
- Places N in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
- Places I in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s look for such a word.  
A good candidate is “BINGO”:
- B, G are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

However, “BINGO” uses O, which was eliminated in AROSE.  
Next candidate: “PINNY”:
- P, Y are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in positions 3 and 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

But “PINNY” has two N’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.  
Another candidate: “DINGY”:
- D, G, Y are still possible.  
- Contains both N and I.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

This seems like a strong choice.

From the four guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates A, R, O, S, E.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates U, T, L.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. CHINK → C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates C, H, K.  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 4.

4. DINGY → D(x) I(✓) N(-) G(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ Eliminates D and G.  
   ⇒ I is in the correct position (position 2).  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: N, I, Y  
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K, D, G  
- I is fixed in position 2.  
- N is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Y is in the word and must be in position 5 (since it was marked ✓ in position 5).

Therefore the word structure is:
- Position 1: N (since it must be in 1 or 5, and 5 is taken by Y)  
- Position 2: I (fixed)  
- Positions 3 and 4: must be from remaining letters (B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z)  
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Looking for a word that fits N I _ _ Y with the remaining letters.  
Possible candidates: N I B B Y, N I F F Y, N I M M Y, N I P P Y, etc.  
The most common valid word is ""NIMBY"" (N-I-M-B-Y).

Let’s verify:
- N: position 1 (allowed)  
- I: position 2 (fixed ✓)  
- M, B: not yet eliminated  
- Y: position 5 (fixed ✓)  
- No eliminated letters appear.

The feedback from NIMBY shows:

N(✓)  – N is correct in position 1  
I(✓)  – I is correct in position 2  
M(x)  – M is not in the word at all  
B(✓)  – B is correct in position 4  
Y(✓)  – Y is correct in position 5  

So the word is now fully determined except for position 3.  
We know:

- Position 1: N  
- Position 2: I  
- Position 3: must be a letter that has not been eliminated yet  
- Position 4: B  
- Position 5: Y  

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K, D, G, M.  
Remaining possible letters for position 3: F, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any others not listed).

The only common 5-letter word that fits N I _ B Y is N I F B Y, but ""NIFBY"" is not a valid English word.  
Looking at the remaining letters, ""N I P B Y"" gives ""NIPBY"" – also invalid.  
""N I V B Y"" → ""NIVBY"" – invalid.  
""N I F B Y"" is invalid.  
""N I J B Y"" → ""NIJBY"" – invalid.  
""N I Q B Y"" → ""NIQBY"" – invalid.  
""N I W B Y"" → ""NIWBY"" – invalid.  
""N I X B Y"" → ""NIXBY"" – invalid.  
""N I Z B Y"" → ""NIZBY"" – invalid.

Wait, let me double-check valid English words. The only valid 5-letter word that fits N I _ B Y is ""NIBBY"" (N-I-B-B-Y), but position 4 is already B, so position 3 can't be B (since B is already in position 4 and we can't have two B's unless the word has two B's). However, ""NIBBY"" would have B in positions 3 and 4, which would mean B is in the word twice. But our feedback shows B is correct in position 4, and we have no information about position 3 yet. 

But looking back at the feedback, when we guessed NIMBY, the feedback was N(✓) I(✓) M(x) B(✓) Y(✓). This implies that position 3 is not M, but it doesn't specify what it is. The word must be N I _ B Y, and the only valid English word is ""NIBBY"".

Let me check if ""NIBBY"" is valid: yes, it's a valid word (meaning to nib or to bite). Also, B has not been eliminated for position 3, since we only know B is correct in position 4, not that it can't appear elsewhere. 

Therefore, the word must be NIBBY.
