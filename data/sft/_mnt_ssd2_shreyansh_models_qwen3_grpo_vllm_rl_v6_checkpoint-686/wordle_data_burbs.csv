- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word contains S, but S is not in position 1.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses S in a position other than 1.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters like R, I, N, O, C, U, etc.

Good candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) - uses S in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) - S is in position 4, good.
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) - S in position 5, good.
- SHINS (S in position 1, skip).

I'll choose CRISP because it uses S in position 4 and introduces new common letters C, R, I, P.

From the two guesses we have:

   - S is in the word but not in position 1.

   - C, I, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, R
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, I, P
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4
- Positions ruled out for R: 2

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and R
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Possible structures:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S

Let's brainstorm:
- B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Looking for words:
- B, R, S, O, N: B R S O N? Doesn't fit S in position 2 or 3.
- F, R, S, O, N: F R S O N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, O, S, N: B R O S N? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, O, S, N: F R O S N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, S, N, O: B R S N O? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, S, N, O: F R S N O? Doesn't fit.

Alternative approach: focus on S in position 2 or 3 and R in remaining positions.

Words with S in position 2:
- B R S _ _ (but R is not in position 2, which is fine here)
- F R S _ _
- G R S _ _
- H R S _ _
- M R S _ _
- N R S _ _
- O R S _ _
- U R S _ _
- V R S _ _
- W R S _ _
- Y R S _ _

Looking for valid words:
- B R S _ _: Not common words.
- F R S _ _: FRSS? Not a word.
- G R S _ _: GRSS? Not a word.
- H R S _ _: HRS? Not a word.
- M R S _ _: MRS? Not a word.
- N R S _ _: NRS? Not a word.
- O R S _ _: ORS? Not a word.
- U R S _ _: URS? Not a word.
- V R S _ _: VRS? Not a word.
- W R S _ _: WRS? Not a word.
- Y R S _ _: YRS? Not a word.

S in position 3:
- _ _ S _ _

- G _ S _ _
- H _ S _ _
- M _ S _ _
- N _ S _ _
- O _ S _ _
- U _ S _ _
- V _ S _ _
- W _ S _ _
- Y _ S _ _

Looking for words:
- B U S _ _: BUS? Not 5 letters.
- F U S _ _: FUS? Not 5 letters.
- G U S _ _: GUS? Not 5 letters.
- H U S _ _: HUS? Not 5 letters.
- M U S _ _: MUS? Not 5 letters.
- N U S _ _: NUS? Not 5 letters.
- O U S _ _: OUS? Not 5 letters.
- V U S _ _: VUS? Not 5 letters.
- W U S _ _: WUS? Not 5 letters.
- B R O S _ : BROS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- B R O S H: BROSSH? Not a word.
- B R O S T: Contains T (excluded).
- B R U S _ : B R U S _ : BRUSH? Contains H (not excluded), but let's check:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H
   - Letters: B, R, U, S, H - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5)
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BRUSH is invalid because R is in position 2.

Alternative word with S in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ S
- B R O _ S: BROS? Not 5 letters.
- F R O _ S: FROSS? Not a word.
- B R O W S: BROWS - valid word.
   - B, R, O, W, S
   - Letters: B, R, O, W, S - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BROWS is invalid.

Next word with S in position 2:
- F R S _ _
- F R S H O: FRSHO? Not a word.
- F R S T _: Contains T (excluded).
- F R S N _: FRSN? Not a word.

Next word with S in position 3:
- B R O S _ : BROSS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- G R O S _ : GROSS - valid word.
   - G, R, O, S, S
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5) - but this has S in position 4 and 5, which is allowed for the first S, but we need to check R position.
   - R is in position 2 (invalid per feedback).

Next word with S in position 5:
- B R O W S - already checked, R in position 2 invalid.
- B R U S H - R in position 2 invalid.
- C R O W S - C is excluded.
- F R O S T - T excluded.
- G R O W S - R in position 2 invalid.
- H A S P O - A, P excluded.
- M A S S Y - A excluded.
- N O S T Y - T excluded.
- O S T R Y - T excluded.

Alternative approach: look for words where R is not in position 2 and S is in position 2,3,5.

Words with R in position 1:
- R _ _ _ _
- R _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- R _ _ S _ (S in position 4 - allowed)
- R _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- R _ _ _ _ with S in position 2,3,5.

Valid words:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R I S E S - I excluded.
- R U S H S - H not excluded, but let's check:
   - R, U, S, H, S
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, S - none are in excluded list.
   - This seems valid.

Another word:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R O S T S - T excluded.
- R O S E Y - E excluded.
- R U S H Y - H, Y not excluded:
   - R, U, S, H, Y
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, Y - none are in excluded list.

Between RUSHY and RUSH, RUSHY is 5 letters.

Let's choose RUSHY as it uses R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and introduces U, H, Y which are new letters.

- B R O S H: BROSSH? Not a word.
- B R O S T: Contains T (excluded).
- B R U S _ : B R U S _ : BRUSH? Contains H (not excluded), but let's check:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H
   - Letters: B, R, U, S, H - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5)
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BRUSH is invalid because R is in position 2.

Alternative word with S in position 5:

- B R O _ S: BROS? Not 5 letters.
- F R O _ S: FROSS? Not a word.
- B R O W S: BROWS - valid word.
   - B, R, O, W, S

   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BROWS is invalid.

- F R S _ _
- F R S H O: FRSHO? Not a word.

- B R O S _ : BROSS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- G R O S _ : GROSS - valid word.
   - G, R, O, S, S
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5) - but this has S in position 4 and 5, which is allowed for the first S, but we need to check R position.
   - R is in position 2 (invalid per feedback).

Next word with S in position 5:
- B R O W S - already checked, R in position 2 invalid.
- B R U S H - R in position 2 invalid.
- C R O W S - C is excluded.
- F R O S T - T excluded.
- G R O W S - R in position 2 invalid.
- H A S P O - A, P excluded.
- M A S S Y - A excluded.
- N O S T Y - T excluded.
- O S T R Y - T excluded.

Alternative approach: look for words where R is not in position 2 and S is in position 2,3,5.

Words with R in position 1:
- R _ _ _ _
- R _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- R _ _ S _ (S in position 4 - allowed)
- R _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- R _ _ _ _ with S in position 2,3,5.

Valid words:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R I S E S - I excluded.
- R U S H S - H not excluded, but let's check:
   - R, U, S, H, S
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, S - none are in excluded list.
   - This seems valid.

Another word:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R O S T S - T excluded.
- R O S E Y - E excluded.
- R U S H Y - H, Y not excluded:
   - R, U, S, H, Y
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, Y - none are in excluded list.

Between RUSHY and RUSH, RUSHY is 5 letters.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word contains S, but S is not in position 1.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses S in a position other than 1.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters like R, I, N, O, C, U, etc.

Good candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) - uses S in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) - S is in position 4, good.
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) - S in position 5, good.
- SHINS (S in position 1, skip).

I'll choose CRISP because it uses S in position 4 and introduces new common letters C, R, I, P.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C, I, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, R
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, I, P
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4
- Positions ruled out for R: 2

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and R
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Possible structures:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S

Let's brainstorm:
- B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Looking for words:
- B, R, S, O, N: B R S O N? Doesn't fit S in position 2 or 3.
- F, R, S, O, N: F R S O N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, O, S, N: B R O S N? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, O, S, N: F R O S N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, S, N, O: B R S N O? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, S, N, O: F R S N O? Doesn't fit.

Alternative approach: focus on S in position 2 or 3 and R in remaining positions.

Words with S in position 2:
- B R S _ _ (but R is not in position 2, which is fine here)
- F R S _ _
- G R S _ _
- H R S _ _
- M R S _ _
- N R S _ _
- O R S _ _
- U R S _ _
- V R S _ _
- W R S _ _
- Y R S _ _

Looking for valid words:
- B R S _ _: Not common words.
- F R S _ _: FRSS? Not a word.
- G R S _ _: GRSS? Not a word.
- H R S _ _: HRS? Not a word.
- M R S _ _: MRS? Not a word.
- N R S _ _: NRS? Not a word.
- O R S _ _: ORS? Not a word.
- U R S _ _: URS? Not a word.
- V R S _ _: VRS? Not a word.
- W R S _ _: WRS? Not a word.
- Y R S _ _: YRS? Not a word.

S in position 3:
- _ _ S _ _
- B _ S _ _ (B _ S _ _)
- F _ S _ _
- G _ S _ _
- H _ S _ _
- M _ S _ _
- N _ S _ _
- O _ S _ _
- U _ S _ _
- V _ S _ _
- W _ S _ _
- Y _ S _ _

Looking for words:
- B U S _ _: BUS? Not 5 letters.
- F U S _ _: FUS? Not 5 letters.
- G U S _ _: GUS? Not 5 letters.
- H U S _ _: HUS? Not 5 letters.
- M U S _ _: MUS? Not 5 letters.
- N U S _ _: NUS? Not 5 letters.
- O U S _ _: OUS? Not 5 letters.
- V U S _ _: VUS? Not 5 letters.
- W U S _ _: WUS? Not 5 letters.
- B R O S _ : BROS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- B R O S H: BROSSH? Not a word.
- B R O S T: Contains T (excluded).
- B R U S _ : B R U S _ : BRUSH? Contains H (not excluded), but let's check:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H
   - Letters: B, R, U, S, H - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5)
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BRUSH is invalid because R is in position 2.

Alternative word with S in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ S
- B R O _ S: BROS? Not 5 letters.
- F R O _ S: FROSS? Not a word.
- B R O W S: BROWS - valid word.
   - B, R, O, W, S
   - Letters: B, R, O, W, S - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BROWS is invalid.

Next word with S in position 2:
- F R S _ _
- F R S H O: FRSHO? Not a word.
- F R S T _: Contains T (excluded).
- F R S N _: FRSN? Not a word.

Next word with S in position 3:
- B R O S _ : BROSS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- G R O S _ : GROSS - valid word.
   - G, R, O, S, S
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5) - but this has S in position 4 and 5, which is allowed for the first S, but we need to check R position.
   - R is in position 2 (invalid per feedback).

Next word with S in position 5:
- B R O W S - already checked, R in position 2 invalid.
- B R U S H - R in position 2 invalid.
- C R O W S - C is excluded.
- F R O S T - T excluded.
- G R O W S - R in position 2 invalid.
- H A S P O - A, P excluded.
- M A S S Y - A excluded.
- N O S T Y - T excluded.
- O S T R Y - T excluded.

Alternative approach: look for words where R is not in position 2 and S is in position 2,3,5.

Words with R in position 1:
- R _ _ _ _
- R _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- R _ _ S _ (S in position 4 - allowed)
- R _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- R _ _ _ _ with S in position 2,3,5.

Valid words:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R I S E S - I excluded.
- R U S H S - H not excluded, but let's check:
   - R, U, S, H, S
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, S - none are in excluded list.
   - This seems valid.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: S, R, U  
Known positions:
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- S is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 across the three guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already confirmed as U.  
  This is a contradiction, so my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 1.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)  
   ⇒ R is in the word, not in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 4.

3. RUSHY → R(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)  
   ⇒ R is in the word, not in position 1.  
   ⇒ U is in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 3.

Combining these:
- S must be in the word, and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.  
  Only remaining possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
- Position 2 is already confirmed as U, so S must be in position 5.

Thus far we have:
- Position 2: U

<guess>MURKS</guess>",MURKS,"From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: S, R, U  
Known positions:
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- S is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 across the three guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already confirmed as U.  
  This is a contradiction, so my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 1.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)

   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 4.

   ⇒ R is in the word, not in position 1.

Combining these:
- S must be in the word, and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.

- Position 2 is already confirmed as U, so S must be in position 5.

Thus far we have:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word contains S, but S is not in position 1.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses S in a position other than 1.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters like R, I, N, O, C, U, etc.

Good candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) - uses S in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) - S is in position 4, good.
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) - S in position 5, good.
- SHINS (S in position 1, skip).

I'll choose CRISP because it uses S in position 4 and introduces new common letters C, R, I, P.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C, I, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, R
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, I, P
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4
- Positions ruled out for R: 2

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and R
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Possible structures:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S

Let's brainstorm:
- B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Looking for words:
- B, R, S, O, N: B R S O N? Doesn't fit S in position 2 or 3.
- F, R, S, O, N: F R S O N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, O, S, N: B R O S N? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, O, S, N: F R O S N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, S, N, O: B R S N O? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, S, N, O: F R S N O? Doesn't fit.

Alternative approach: focus on S in position 2 or 3 and R in remaining positions.

Words with S in position 2:
- B R S _ _ (but R is not in position 2, which is fine here)
- F R S _ _
- G R S _ _
- H R S _ _
- M R S _ _
- N R S _ _
- O R S _ _
- U R S _ _
- V R S _ _
- W R S _ _
- Y R S _ _

Looking for valid words:
- B R S _ _: Not common words.
- F R S _ _: FRSS? Not a word.
- G R S _ _: GRSS? Not a word.
- H R S _ _: HRS? Not a word.
- M R S _ _: MRS? Not a word.
- N R S _ _: NRS? Not a word.
- O R S _ _: ORS? Not a word.
- U R S _ _: URS? Not a word.
- V R S _ _: VRS? Not a word.
- W R S _ _: WRS? Not a word.
- Y R S _ _: YRS? Not a word.

S in position 3:
- _ _ S _ _
- B _ S _ _ (B _ S _ _)
- F _ S _ _
- G _ S _ _
- H _ S _ _
- M _ S _ _
- N _ S _ _
- O _ S _ _
- U _ S _ _
- V _ S _ _
- W _ S _ _
- Y _ S _ _

Looking for words:
- B U S _ _: BUS? Not 5 letters.
- F U S _ _: FUS? Not 5 letters.
- G U S _ _: GUS? Not 5 letters.
- H U S _ _: HUS? Not 5 letters.
- M U S _ _: MUS? Not 5 letters.
- N U S _ _: NUS? Not 5 letters.
- O U S _ _: OUS? Not 5 letters.
- V U S _ _: VUS? Not 5 letters.
- W U S _ _: WUS? Not 5 letters.
- B R O S _ : BROS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- B R O S H: BROSSH? Not a word.
- B R O S T: Contains T (excluded).
- B R U S _ : B R U S _ : BRUSH? Contains H (not excluded), but let's check:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H
   - Letters: B, R, U, S, H - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5)
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BRUSH is invalid because R is in position 2.

Alternative word with S in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ S
- B R O _ S: BROS? Not 5 letters.
- F R O _ S: FROSS? Not a word.
- B R O W S: BROWS - valid word.
   - B, R, O, W, S
   - Letters: B, R, O, W, S - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BROWS is invalid.

Next word with S in position 2:
- F R S _ _
- F R S H O: FRSHO? Not a word.
- F R S T _: Contains T (excluded).
- F R S N _: FRSN? Not a word.

Next word with S in position 3:
- B R O S _ : BROSS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- G R O S _ : GROSS - valid word.
   - G, R, O, S, S
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5) - but this has S in position 4 and 5, which is allowed for the first S, but we need to check R position.
   - R is in position 2 (invalid per feedback).

Next word with S in position 5:
- B R O W S - already checked, R in position 2 invalid.
- B R U S H - R in position 2 invalid.
- C R O W S - C is excluded.
- F R O S T - T excluded.
- G R O W S - R in position 2 invalid.
- H A S P O - A, P excluded.
- M A S S Y - A excluded.
- N O S T Y - T excluded.
- O S T R Y - T excluded.

Alternative approach: look for words where R is not in position 2 and S is in position 2,3,5.

Words with R in position 1:
- R _ _ _ _
- R _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- R _ _ S _ (S in position 4 - allowed)
- R _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- R _ _ _ _ with S in position 2,3,5.

Valid words:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R I S E S - I excluded.
- R U S H S - H not excluded, but let's check:
   - R, U, S, H, S
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, S - none are in excluded list.
   - This seems valid.

Another word:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R O S T S - T excluded.
- R O S E Y - E excluded.
- R U S H Y - H, Y not excluded:
   - R, U, S, H, Y
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, Y - none are in excluded list.

Between RUSHY and RUSH, RUSHY is 5 letters.

Let's choose RUSHY as it uses R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and introduces U, H, Y which are new letters.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word contains S, but S is not in position 1.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses S in a position other than 1.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters like R, I, N, O, C, U, etc.

Good candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) - uses S in position 1, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) - S is in position 4, good.
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) - S in position 5, good.
- SHINS (S in position 1, skip).

I'll choose CRISP because it uses S in position 4 and introduces new common letters C, R, I, P.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C, I, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, R
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, I, P
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4
- Positions ruled out for R: 2

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and R
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Possible structures:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S

Let's brainstorm:
- B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Looking for words:
- B, R, S, O, N: B R S O N? Doesn't fit S in position 2 or 3.
- F, R, S, O, N: F R S O N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, O, S, N: B R O S N? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, O, S, N: F R O S N? Doesn't fit.
- B, R, S, N, O: B R S N O? Doesn't fit S in position 2.
- F, R, S, N, O: F R S N O? Doesn't fit.

Alternative approach: focus on S in position 2 or 3 and R in remaining positions.

Words with S in position 2:
- B R S _ _ (but R is not in position 2, which is fine here)
- F R S _ _
- G R S _ _
- H R S _ _
- M R S _ _
- N R S _ _
- O R S _ _
- U R S _ _
- V R S _ _
- W R S _ _
- Y R S _ _

Looking for valid words:
- B R S _ _: Not common words.
- F R S _ _: FRSS? Not a word.
- G R S _ _: GRSS? Not a word.
- H R S _ _: HRS? Not a word.
- M R S _ _: MRS? Not a word.
- N R S _ _: NRS? Not a word.
- O R S _ _: ORS? Not a word.
- U R S _ _: URS? Not a word.
- V R S _ _: VRS? Not a word.
- W R S _ _: WRS? Not a word.
- Y R S _ _: YRS? Not a word.

S in position 3:
- _ _ S _ _
- B _ S _ _ (B _ S _ _)
- F _ S _ _
- G _ S _ _
- H _ S _ _
- M _ S _ _
- N _ S _ _
- O _ S _ _
- U _ S _ _
- V _ S _ _
- W _ S _ _
- Y _ S _ _

Looking for words:
- B U S _ _: BUS? Not 5 letters.
- F U S _ _: FUS? Not 5 letters.
- G U S _ _: GUS? Not 5 letters.
- H U S _ _: HUS? Not 5 letters.
- M U S _ _: MUS? Not 5 letters.
- N U S _ _: NUS? Not 5 letters.
- O U S _ _: OUS? Not 5 letters.
- V U S _ _: VUS? Not 5 letters.
- W U S _ _: WUS? Not 5 letters.
- B R O S _ : BROS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- B R O S H: BROSSH? Not a word.
- B R O S T: Contains T (excluded).
- B R U S _ : B R U S _ : BRUSH? Contains H (not excluded), but let's check:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H
   - Letters: B, R, U, S, H - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5)
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BRUSH is invalid because R is in position 2.

Alternative word with S in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ S
- B R O _ S: BROS? Not 5 letters.
- F R O _ S: FROSS? Not a word.
- B R O W S: BROWS - valid word.
   - B, R, O, W, S
   - Letters: B, R, O, W, S - none are in the excluded list.
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).
   - R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so BROWS is invalid.

Next word with S in position 2:
- F R S _ _
- F R S H O: FRSHO? Not a word.
- F R S T _: Contains T (excluded).
- F R S N _: FRSN? Not a word.

Next word with S in position 3:
- B R O S _ : BROSS? Not a word.
- F R O S _ : FROST? Contains T (excluded).
- G R O S _ : GROSS - valid word.
   - G, R, O, S, S
   - S is in position 4 (allowed: 2,3,5) - but this has S in position 4 and 5, which is allowed for the first S, but we need to check R position.
   - R is in position 2 (invalid per feedback).

Next word with S in position 5:
- B R O W S - already checked, R in position 2 invalid.
- B R U S H - R in position 2 invalid.
- C R O W S - C is excluded.
- F R O S T - T excluded.
- G R O W S - R in position 2 invalid.
- H A S P O - A, P excluded.
- M A S S Y - A excluded.
- N O S T Y - T excluded.
- O S T R Y - T excluded.

Alternative approach: look for words where R is not in position 2 and S is in position 2,3,5.

Words with R in position 1:
- R _ _ _ _
- R _ S _ _ (S in position 3)
- R _ _ S _ (S in position 4 - allowed)
- R _ _ _ S (S in position 5)
- R _ _ _ _ with S in position 2,3,5.

Valid words:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R I S E S - I excluded.
- R U S H S - H not excluded, but let's check:
   - R, U, S, H, S
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, S - none are in excluded list.
   - This seems valid.

Another word:
- R O S E S - E excluded.
- R O S T S - T excluded.
- R O S E Y - E excluded.
- R U S H Y - H, Y not excluded:
   - R, U, S, H, Y
   - R in position 1 (allowed)
   - S in position 3 (allowed)
   - Letters: R, U, S, H, Y - none are in excluded list.

Between RUSHY and RUSH, RUSHY is 5 letters.

Let's choose RUSHY as it uses R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), and introduces U, H, Y which are new letters.

Guess 3: RUSHY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: S, R, U  
Known positions:
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- S is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 across the three guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already confirmed as U.  
  This is a contradiction, so my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 1.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) P(x)  
   ⇒ R is in the word, not in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 4.

3. RUSHY → R(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)  
   ⇒ R is in the word, not in position 1.  
   ⇒ U is in position 2.  
   ⇒ S is in the word, not in position 3.

Combining these:
- S must be in the word, and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.  
  Only remaining possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
- Position 2 is already confirmed as U, so S must be in position 5.

Thus far we have:
- Position 2: U  
- Position 5: S

Letters known to be in the word: R, U, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, E, C, I, P, H, Y

Remaining candidate letters: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, O, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
_ U _ _ S
with R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since R cannot be in 1, 2).

Possible structures:
- _ U R _ S
- _ U _ R S

Looking for valid English words fitting these patterns:

- BURPS – P excluded
- DURPS – P excluded
- FUROR – second R would duplicate, but let’s check: F, U, R, O, R – R appears twice; we don’t know yet if R appears once or twice, but it’s possible.
- GURKS – G, U, R, K, S – all letters allowed and not yet ruled out.
- MURKS – M, U, R, K, S – all letters allowed.
- NURKS – not a valid word.
- VURKS – not a word.
- WURKS – not a word.

Between GURKS and MURKS, MURKS is a valid English word (past participle of “murk” or relating to murkiness).

Let’s choose MURKS.

- Position 2 is U (✓)

So the word has the pattern: _ U R _ S

The missing letters (positions 1 and 4) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters. Valid remaining letters: B, D, F, G, N, O, V, W, X, Z.
