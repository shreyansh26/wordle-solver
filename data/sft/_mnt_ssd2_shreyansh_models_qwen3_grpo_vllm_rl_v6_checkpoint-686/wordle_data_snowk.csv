For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 4).
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
- S appears somewhere, but not in position 4.
- A, R, E are excluded.

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping O in position 3 and trying to place S in a different spot. Good consonants to test now might be T, N, L, D, C, etc. I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Moves S to position 1 or 2 or 5.
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

A strong candidate is “STONY”:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, N, Y are new letters.
- O stays in position 3.
- It’s a valid word.

Another candidate is “SPOON” but it repeats O and P, and we already know O is in position 3. “SLOTH” is also possible but introduces H which is less common. “STONY” seems best for coverage.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).  
   - O is still correct in position 3.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - T and Y are not in the word.

3. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   - S is still correct in position 1.  
   - O is now marked (-), which contradicts guess 2 where O was ✓.  
   The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for SOUND is relative to SOUND’s positions, and the absolute position of O is still confirmed to be 3 from guess 2.  
   - U and D are not in the word.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already known) and also not in position 5 (because N(-) in SOUND means N is not in position 5 either).  
   Therefore N must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
S N O _ _

Letters known to be in the word: S, N, O.  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, T, Y, U, D.  

Remaining positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
Common remaining consonants: C, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out).

Let’s test a word that fits S N O _ _ and uses new common letters.  
Candidate: SNOWY – but Y is out.  
Candidate: SNOWS – repeats S.  
Candidate: SNORT – T is out.  
Candidate: SNOWP – not a word.

Between these, “SNICK” uses C which is slightly more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 4).
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
- S appears somewhere, but not in position 4.
- A, R, E are excluded.

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping O in position 3 and trying to place S in a different spot. Good consonants to test now might be T, N, L, D, C, etc. I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Moves S to position 1 or 2 or 5.
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

A strong candidate is “STONY”:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, N, Y are new letters.
- O stays in position 3.
- It’s a valid word.

Another candidate is “SPOON” but it repeats O and P, and we already know O is in position 3. “SLOTH” is also possible but introduces H which is less common. “STONY” seems best for coverage.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is correct in position 3.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   - S is now confirmed in position 1.  
   - O is confirmed in position 3.  
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - T and Y are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ O _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S (pos 1), O (pos 3), N (somewhere else).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, Y.

We still need to place N somewhere other than position 4. Possible positions for N: 2, 4, or 5. But since N(-) in STONY means it’s not in position 4, N must be in position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to test new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. Good candidates: D, L, C, H, I, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps S in position 1 and O in position 3.  
- Puts N in position 2 (since that’s a new spot for it).  
- Introduces new common letters like D and I.

A word that fits is “SOUND”:
- S (✓) in position 1.  
- O (✓) in position 3.  
- U is a new vowel.  
- N in position 2 (new spot).  
- D is a new consonant.  

This tests U and D while placing N in position 2.

   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - T and Y are not in the word.

3. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   - S is still correct in position 1.  
   - O is now marked (-), which contradicts guess 2 where O was ✓.  
   The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for SOUND is relative to SOUND’s positions, and the absolute position of O is still confirmed to be 3 from guess 2.  
   - U and D are not in the word.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already known) and also not in position 5 (because N(-) in SOUND means N is not in position 5 either).  
   Therefore N must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
S N O _ _

Letters known to be in the word: S, N, O.  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, T, Y, U, D.  

Remaining positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
Common remaining consonants: C, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out).

Let’s test a word that fits S N O _ _ and uses new common letters.  
Candidate: SNOWY – but Y is out.  
Candidate: SNOWS – repeats S.  
Candidate: SNORT – T is out.  
Candidate: SNOWP – not a word.

The best valid word that fits S N O _ _ and introduces new letters is “SNICK” (C and I are new, and it’s a valid word).

Between these, “SNICK” uses C which is slightly more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 4).
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
- S appears somewhere, but not in position 4.
- A, R, E are excluded.

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping O in position 3 and trying to place S in a different spot. Good consonants to test now might be T, N, L, D, C, etc. I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Moves S to position 1 or 2 or 5.
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

A strong candidate is “STONY”:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, N, Y are new letters.
- O stays in position 3.
- It’s a valid word.

Another candidate is “SPOON” but it repeats O and P, and we already know O is in position 3. “SLOTH” is also possible but introduces H which is less common. “STONY” seems best for coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is correct in position 3.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   - S is now confirmed in position 1.  
   - O is confirmed in position 3.  
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - T and Y are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ O _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S (pos 1), O (pos 3), N (somewhere else).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, Y.

We still need to place N somewhere other than position 4. Possible positions for N: 2, 4, or 5. But since N(-) in STONY means it’s not in position 4, N must be in position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to test new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. Good candidates: D, L, C, H, I, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps S in position 1 and O in position 3.  
- Puts N in position 2 (since that’s a new spot for it).  
- Introduces new common letters like D and I.

A word that fits is “SOUND”:
- S (✓) in position 1.  
- O (✓) in position 3.  
- U is a new vowel.  
- N in position 2 (new spot).  
- D is a new consonant.  

This tests U and D while placing N in position 2.

Guess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).  
   - O is still correct in position 3.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - T and Y are not in the word.

3. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   - S is still correct in position 1.  
   - O is now marked (-), which contradicts guess 2 where O was ✓.  
   The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for SOUND is relative to SOUND’s positions, and the absolute position of O is still confirmed to be 3 from guess 2.  
   - U and D are not in the word.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already known) and also not in position 5 (because N(-) in SOUND means N is not in position 5 either).  
   Therefore N must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
S N O _ _

Letters known to be in the word: S, N, O.  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, T, Y, U, D.  

Remaining positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
Common remaining consonants: C, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out).

Let’s test a word that fits S N O _ _ and uses new common letters.  
Candidate: SNOWY – but Y is out.  
Candidate: SNOWS – repeats S.  
Candidate: SNORT – T is out.  
Candidate: SNOWP – not a word.  
Candidate: SNICK – C and I are new.  
Candidate: SNOWL – L is new, but “SNOWL” is not a valid word.  
Candidate: SNOCK – C and K are new, but “SNOCK” is rare.  
Candidate: SNOOK – K and K, repeats K.  
Candidate: SNOOP – P and P, repeats P.  
Candidate: SNIPS – P and I are new, but repeats S.  
Candidate: SNIBS – B and S, repeats S.  
Candidate: SNOOD – D is out.  
Candidate: SNOUT – U and T are out.  
Candidate: SNOOP – already considered.  
Candidate: SNOOK – already considered.  
Candidate: SNOCK – already considered.  

The best valid word that fits S N O _ _ and introduces new letters is “SNICK” (C and I are new, and it’s a valid word).  
Another valid option is “SNIPS” (P and I are new).  
Between these, “SNICK” uses C which is slightly more common.

Let’s go with SNICK.

From the five guesses we now have the following confirmed facts:

1. Positions:
   - 1: S (✓ in every line)
   - 2: N (✓ in guesses 2,4,5)
   - 3: O (✓ in guesses 1,2,3,5)
   - 5: K (✓ in guesses 4,5)

2. Letters known to be in the word: S, N, O, K

3. Letter in position 4:
   - From guess 5 (SNOOK) we have O(-) in position 4, meaning O is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have O in position 3, the only other place O could appear is position 4, but feedback says it's not there. Therefore, position 4 cannot be O.

4. Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, T, Y, U, D, I, C

5. Remaining possible letters for position 4: any letter not yet excluded and not already placed (S, N, O, K are already used in their positions). Common remaining letters include B, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

6. We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern S N O _ K and uses a letter in position 4 that hasn't been excluded and isn't already used (S, N, O, K). The only valid word that fits this pattern is SNOBK, but that's not a real word. Another candidate is SNOOK, but we've already tried that. 

Wait, let's list all possible letters for position 4:
- From remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W

Looking for real words:
- SNOBK – invalid
- SNOLK – invalid
- SNOMK – invalid
- SNOPK – invalid
- SNOWK – invalid
- SNOHK – invalid
- SNOGK – invalid
- SNOVK – invalid

Actually, the only valid word that fits S N O _ K is SNOOK, but we've already tried it and got feedback that O is not in position 4. Since we've exhausted all obvious candidates and SNOOK is the only possible word, but it's invalid for position 4, this suggests we might have missed something.

However, looking back, the pattern is S N O _ K, and position 4 must be a letter not yet excluded. The only remaining valid word is SNOOK, but since position 4 can't be O, and no other obvious word fits, this implies the word must be SNOOK despite the O(-) feedback, indicating a possible oversight.

But upon re-examining, the feedback for SNOOK shows O(-) in position 4, meaning O is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have O in position 3, this is consistent. The word must be SNOOK because it's the only valid 5-letter word matching S N O _ K, even though it places O in position 4 which was marked as wrong position. This suggests the word is indeed SNOOK, and the feedback indicates the second O is extra.

Therefore, the word must be SNOOK.
</think>

The pattern is now locked: S N O _ K.  
The only valid 5-letter word that fits is SNOOK, despite the earlier ""O(-)"" feedback, because the second O in position 4 was marked wrong-position, confirming the word contains exactly one O in position 3. SNOOK is the only remaining candidate.
