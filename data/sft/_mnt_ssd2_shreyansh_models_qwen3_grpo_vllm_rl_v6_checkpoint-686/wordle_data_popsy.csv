For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the first position.
2. The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.
3. We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. Words like:
- CHINS
- SHOCK
- SHIRK
- SHINS
- SHIRT

""SHIRK"" uses:
- S (moved to first position, but we know it's not correct there, so we'll test it in position 2)
- H, I, R, K (new letters)

This gives us good coverage of remaining common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the first position.
2. The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.
3. We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. Words like:
- CHINS
- SHOCK
- SHIRK
- SHINS
- SHIRT

""SHIRK"" uses:
- S (moved to first position, but we know it's not correct there, so we'll test it in position 2)
- H, I, R, K (new letters)

This gives us good coverage of remaining common letters.

Let's parse the new feedback from MOSSY:

MOSSY → M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)

1. M is NOT in the word (x).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓).
3. First S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — but we already knew S is in the word and not in position 1.
4. Second S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
5. Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓).

So the current known pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown (but not any of the forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown (but not any of the forbidden letters, and not S because S is already in position 4)
- Position 4: S (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Forbidden letters accumulated so far: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ O _ S Y, where:
- Position 1: any of the remaining allowed letters (B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z)
- Position 3: any of the remaining allowed letters except S (since S is already in position 4)

Looking at common English words that fit this pattern:
- BOSSY: but S is already in position 4 and we have a double S, which might be possible, but let's check if B is allowed (yes, B is allowed)
- COSSY: C is allowed
- FOSSY: F is allowed
- GOSSY: G is allowed
- JOSSY: J is allowed
- POSKY: but K is forbidden
- VOSKY: K is forbidden
- WOSKY: K is forbidden

The most common and likely valid word here is ""BOSSY"". Let's verify:
- B: allowed
- O: correct position
- S: correct position (position 4)
- S: already in position 4, but this would be position 3 - but we know S is in position 4, so position 3 cannot be S. This suggests ""BOSSY"" might not fit because it has S in position 3.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern:
The word must be _ O _ S Y with:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So the word structure is: X O X S Y

Looking at valid words with this structure:
- BOSSY: B O S S Y - but this would have S in position 3, which contradicts our feedback that S is in position 4 (from MOSSY feedback: S(✓) in position 4). So BOSSY has S in position 3, which would get (-) feedback, but we know it got (✓) for position 4. Therefore BOSSY is invalid.

Next possible word: ""COSSY"" - same issue, S in position 3.

""FOSSY"" - same issue.

""JOSSY"" - J O S S Y - S in position 3.

""POSKY"" - but K is forbidden.

""VOSKY"" - K is forbidden.

""GOSSY"" - S in position 3.

""BOSSY"" is the only common word, but it doesn't fit the pattern because it has S in position 3 and 4, but our feedback says S is in position 4 and not in position 1 or 3 (from SLATE and SHIRK feedback). 

This suggests we need a word with S only in position 4, and another letter in position 3. 

Looking for _ O _ S Y with:
- Position 1: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 3: same remaining letters, but not S

Possible words:
- BOGSOY: but this seems obscure
- BOCKS: but doesn't end with Y
- BOPPY: but P is allowed, but doesn't have S in position 4
- BOVSY: but V is allowed, and B O V S Y - this seems valid

""BOVSY"" is a valid English word (though rare, it's a surname). However, let's check if any letters are forbidden:
- B: allowed
- O: allowed
- V: allowed
- S: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits the pattern B O V S Y.

Another possibility: ""COVSY"" - but C is allowed, same issue.

""FOVSY"" - F is allowed.

But the most common-sounding word here is ""BOVSY"".

However, let me think of more common words. The pattern _ O _ S Y is quite restrictive. 

Another check: ""WOSSY"" - but W is allowed, and it's W O S S Y - again S in position 3.

This seems to be the only possible word with S in position 4 and another letter in position 3, but the letters available are limited.

Given the constraints, ""BOVSY"" seems to be the only valid remaining option.

But wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From MOSSY:
- M(x) - M is not in the word
- O(✓) - O is correct in position 2
- S(-) - S is in the word but not in position 3 (since it got (-) for position 3, but we already knew S is in position 4 from S(✓) in position 4)
- S(✓) - S is correct in position 4
- Y(✓) - Y is correct in position 5

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ S Y

And the letters in positions 1 and 3 must be from the remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form X O X S Y.

Looking up valid English words with this pattern:
- BOSSY - but S in position 3 would get (-), but we know S is in position 4, so this is invalid
- COSSY - same issue
- FOSSY - same
- GOSSY - same
- JOSSY - same
- POSKY - K is forbidden
- VOSKY - K is forbidden
- WOSKY - K is forbidden

It appears the only possible word is ""BOVSY"" (a surname), but it's quite obscure.

However, let me check ""BOSSY"" again - if the word has S in position 4, then position 3 could be another letter, but ""BOSSY"" has S in position 3 and 4, which would give (-) for position 3 and (✓) for position 4. This is possible because the feedback for position 3 is separate from position 4. 

But the feedback for MOSSY was:
M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: M is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: O is correct (✓)
- Position 3: S is in the word but not in this position (-)
- Position 4: S is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

Thus the word is _ O _ S Y with S in position 4, and position 3 is not S.

Therefore, possible words:
- B O W S Y - but W is allowed
- B O P S Y - but P is allowed
- C O P S Y - but P is allowed
- F O P S Y - P is allowed
- G O P S Y - P is allowed

""BOPSY"" seems like a valid word (a variant of ""bopsy"" or a surname), but let's check if any letters are forbidden:
- B: allowed
- O: allowed
- P: allowed
- S: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits perfectly.

Another possibility: ""COBSY"" - but C is allowed.

""FOBSY"" - F is allowed.

But ""BOPSY"" is the most common-sounding word among these.

Thus, the correct next guess is ""BOPSY"".
</think>

From the feedback on MOSSY we now know:
- The word is of the form _ O _ S Y (O in position 2, S in position 4, Y in position 5).
- Position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.
- Allowed letters for those positions are among B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""BOPSY"".

<guess>BOPSY</guess>",BOPSY,"Let's parse the new feedback from MOSSY:

MOSSY → M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)

1. M is NOT in the word (x).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓).
3. First S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — but we already knew S is in the word and not in position 1.
4. Second S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
5. Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓).

So the current known pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown (but not any of the forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown (but not any of the forbidden letters, and not S because S is already in position 4)
- Position 4: S (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Forbidden letters accumulated so far: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ O _ S Y, where:
- Position 1: any of the remaining allowed letters (B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z)
- Position 3: any of the remaining allowed letters except S (since S is already in position 4)

Looking at common English words that fit this pattern:
- BOSSY: but S is already in position 4 and we have a double S, which might be possible, but let's check if B is allowed (yes, B is allowed)
- COSSY: C is allowed
- FOSSY: F is allowed
- GOSSY: G is allowed
- JOSSY: J is allowed
- POSKY: but K is forbidden
- VOSKY: K is forbidden
- WOSKY: K is forbidden

The most common and likely valid word here is ""BOSSY"". Let's verify:
- B: allowed
- O: correct position
- S: correct position (position 4)
- S: already in position 4, but this would be position 3 - but we know S is in position 4, so position 3 cannot be S. This suggests ""BOSSY"" might not fit because it has S in position 3.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern:
The word must be _ O _ S Y with:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So the word structure is: X O X S Y

Looking at valid words with this structure:
- BOSSY: B O S S Y - but this would have S in position 3, which contradicts our feedback that S is in position 4 (from MOSSY feedback: S(✓) in position 4). So BOSSY has S in position 3, which would get (-) feedback, but we know it got (✓) for position 4. Therefore BOSSY is invalid.

Next possible word: ""COSSY"" - same issue, S in position 3.

""FOSSY"" - same issue.

""JOSSY"" - J O S S Y - S in position 3.

""POSKY"" - but K is forbidden.

""VOSKY"" - K is forbidden.

""GOSSY"" - S in position 3.

""BOSSY"" is the only common word, but it doesn't fit the pattern because it has S in position 3 and 4, but our feedback says S is in position 4 and not in position 1 or 3 (from SLATE and SHIRK feedback). 

This suggests we need a word with S only in position 4, and another letter in position 3. 

Looking for _ O _ S Y with:
- Position 1: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 3: same remaining letters, but not S

Possible words:
- BOGSOY: but this seems obscure
- BOCKS: but doesn't end with Y
- BOPPY: but P is allowed, but doesn't have S in position 4
- BOVSY: but V is allowed, and B O V S Y - this seems valid

""BOVSY"" is a valid English word (though rare, it's a surname). However, let's check if any letters are forbidden:
- B: allowed
- O: allowed
- V: allowed
- S: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits the pattern B O V S Y.

Another possibility: ""COVSY"" - but C is allowed, same issue.

""FOVSY"" - F is allowed.

But the most common-sounding word here is ""BOVSY"".

However, let me think of more common words. The pattern _ O _ S Y is quite restrictive. 

Another check: ""WOSSY"" - but W is allowed, and it's W O S S Y - again S in position 3.

This seems to be the only possible word with S in position 4 and another letter in position 3, but the letters available are limited.

Given the constraints, ""BOVSY"" seems to be the only valid remaining option.

But wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From MOSSY:
- M(x) - M is not in the word
- O(✓) - O is correct in position 2
- S(-) - S is in the word but not in position 3 (since it got (-) for position 3, but we already knew S is in position 4 from S(✓) in position 4)
- S(✓) - S is correct in position 4
- Y(✓) - Y is correct in position 5

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ S Y

And the letters in positions 1 and 3 must be from the remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form X O X S Y.

Looking up valid English words with this pattern:
- BOSSY - but S in position 3 would get (-), but we know S is in position 4, so this is invalid
- COSSY - same issue
- FOSSY - same
- GOSSY - same
- JOSSY - same
- POSKY - K is forbidden
- VOSKY - K is forbidden
- WOSKY - K is forbidden

It appears the only possible word is ""BOVSY"" (a surname), but it's quite obscure.

However, let me check ""BOSSY"" again - if the word has S in position 4, then position 3 could be another letter, but ""BOSSY"" has S in position 3 and 4, which would give (-) for position 3 and (✓) for position 4. This is possible because the feedback for position 3 is separate from position 4. 

But the feedback for MOSSY was:
M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: M is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: O is correct (✓)
- Position 3: S is in the word but not in this position (-)
- Position 4: S is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

Thus the word is _ O _ S Y with S in position 4, and position 3 is not S.

Therefore, possible words:
- B O W S Y - but W is allowed
- B O P S Y - but P is allowed
- C O P S Y - but P is allowed
- F O P S Y - P is allowed
- G O P S Y - P is allowed

""BOPSY"" seems like a valid word (a variant of ""bopsy"" or a surname), but let's check if any letters are forbidden:
- B: allowed
- O: allowed
- P: allowed
- S: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits perfectly.

Another possibility: ""COBSY"" - but C is allowed.

""FOBSY"" - F is allowed.

But ""BOPSY"" is the most common-sounding word among these.

Thus, the correct next guess is ""BOPSY"".From the feedback on MOSSY we now know:
- The word is of the form _ O _ S Y (O in position 2, S in position 4, Y in position 5).
- Position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.
- Allowed letters for those positions are among B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the first position.
2. The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.
3. We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants.

A good next guess would use new letters while placing S in a different position. Words like:
- CHINS
- SHOCK
- SHIRK
- SHINS
- SHIRT

""SHIRK"" uses:
- S (moved to first position, but we know it's not correct there, so we'll test it in position 2)
- H, I, R, K (new letters)

This gives us good coverage of remaining common letters.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S exists but is not in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, T, E are absent.

2. SHIRK → S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)
   - S exists but is not in position 1 (again).
   - Letters H, I, R, K are absent.

So far we know:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K.
- Allowed letters still include: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know positions 1 and 5 are still open for S (since S has only been tested in position 1 so far).

We need a word that:
- Contains S (not in position 1).
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Tests new common consonants and vowels (O, U are the remaining common vowels).

Candidate words:
- SOUND: uses S (position 2), O, U, N, D.
- MOUND: uses S (position 3), O, U, N, D.
- BONUS: uses S (position 5), B, O, N, U.

Let’s pick ""SOUND"" because it places S in position 2 and tests O, U, N, D.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S exists but is not in position 1.
   - Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E.

2. SHIRK → S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(x)
   - S exists but is not in position 1 (again).
   - Forbidden letters add: H, I, R, K.

3. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S exists but is not in position 1 (again).
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - Forbidden letters add: U, N, D.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is already O, so positions 3, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, and vowels O (already placed), and the only remaining common vowel is Y sometimes acting as vowel.

We need a word that:
- Starts with any letter except the forbidden ones.
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains S somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BOSSY: but Y is allowed, but S is in position 3 and 4, but double S might be unlikely.
- COSPY: C, O, S, P, Y - but P and Y are allowed, S in position 3.
- FOSSY: F, O, S, S, Y - similar to BOSSY.
- MOSSY: M, O, S, S, Y - M is allowed, S in position 3.
- POSKY: but K is forbidden.
- VOSKY: same issue with K.
- WOSSY: W, O, S, S, Y - W is allowed.

""MOSSY"" seems good: M is allowed, O is correct in position 2, S is in position 3, and the rest are allowed letters (M, S, Y).

Let's verify:
- M: allowed
- O: allowed and correct position
- S: allowed and we know it's in the word
- S: same
- Y: allowed

No forbidden letters used.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback from MOSSY:

MOSSY → M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)

1. M is NOT in the word (x).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓).
3. First S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — but we already knew S is in the word and not in position 1.
4. Second S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
5. Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓).

So the current known pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown (but not any of the forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown (but not any of the forbidden letters, and not S because S is already in position 4)
- Position 4: S (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Forbidden letters accumulated so far: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ O _ S Y, where:
- Position 1: any of the remaining allowed letters (B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z)
- Position 3: any of the remaining allowed letters except S (since S is already in position 4)

Looking at common English words that fit this pattern:
- BOSSY: but S is already in position 4 and we have a double S, which might be possible, but let's check if B is allowed (yes, B is allowed)
- COSSY: C is allowed
- FOSSY: F is allowed
- GOSSY: G is allowed
- JOSSY: J is allowed
- POSKY: but K is forbidden
- VOSKY: K is forbidden
- WOSKY: K is forbidden

The most common and likely valid word here is ""BOSSY"". Let's verify:
- B: allowed
- O: correct position
- S: correct position (position 4)
- S: already in position 4, but this would be position 3 - but we know S is in position 4, so position 3 cannot be S. This suggests ""BOSSY"" might not fit because it has S in position 3.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern:
The word must be _ O _ S Y with:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So the word structure is: X O X S Y

Looking at valid words with this structure:
- BOSSY: B O S S Y - but this would have S in position 3, which contradicts our feedback that S is in position 4 (from MOSSY feedback: S(✓) in position 4). So BOSSY has S in position 3, which would get (-) feedback, but we know it got (✓) for position 4. Therefore BOSSY is invalid.

Next possible word: ""COSSY"" - same issue, S in position 3.

""FOSSY"" - same issue.

""JOSSY"" - J O S S Y - S in position 3.

""POSKY"" - but K is forbidden.

""VOSKY"" - K is forbidden.

""GOSSY"" - S in position 3.

""BOSSY"" is the only common word, but it doesn't fit the pattern because it has S in position 3 and 4, but our feedback says S is in position 4 and not in position 1 or 3 (from SLATE and SHIRK feedback). 

This suggests we need a word with S only in position 4, and another letter in position 3. 

Looking for _ O _ S Y with:
- Position 1: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 3: same remaining letters, but not S

Possible words:
- BOGSOY: but this seems obscure
- BOCKS: but doesn't end with Y
- BOPPY: but P is allowed, but doesn't have S in position 4
- BOVSY: but V is allowed, and B O V S Y - this seems valid

""BOVSY"" is a valid English word (though rare, it's a surname). However, let's check if any letters are forbidden:
- B: allowed
- O: allowed
- V: allowed
- S: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits the pattern B O V S Y.

Another possibility: ""COVSY"" - but C is allowed, same issue.

""FOVSY"" - F is allowed.

But the most common-sounding word here is ""BOVSY"".

However, let me think of more common words. The pattern _ O _ S Y is quite restrictive. 

Another check: ""WOSSY"" - but W is allowed, and it's W O S S Y - again S in position 3.

This seems to be the only possible word with S in position 4 and another letter in position 3, but the letters available are limited.

Given the constraints, ""BOVSY"" seems to be the only valid remaining option.

But wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From MOSSY:
- M(x) - M is not in the word
- O(✓) - O is correct in position 2
- S(-) - S is in the word but not in position 3 (since it got (-) for position 3, but we already knew S is in position 4 from S(✓) in position 4)
- S(✓) - S is correct in position 4
- Y(✓) - Y is correct in position 5

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ S Y

And the letters in positions 1 and 3 must be from the remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form X O X S Y.

Looking up valid English words with this pattern:
- BOSSY - but S in position 3 would get (-), but we know S is in position 4, so this is invalid
- COSSY - same issue
- FOSSY - same
- GOSSY - same
- JOSSY - same
- POSKY - K is forbidden
- VOSKY - K is forbidden
- WOSKY - K is forbidden

It appears the only possible word is ""BOVSY"" (a surname), but it's quite obscure.

However, let me check ""BOSSY"" again - if the word has S in position 4, then position 3 could be another letter, but ""BOSSY"" has S in position 3 and 4, which would give (-) for position 3 and (✓) for position 4. This is possible because the feedback for position 3 is separate from position 4. 

But the feedback for MOSSY was:
M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: M is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: O is correct (✓)
- Position 3: S is in the word but not in this position (-)
- Position 4: S is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

Thus the word is _ O _ S Y with S in position 4, and position 3 is not S.

Therefore, possible words:
- B O W S Y - but W is allowed
- B O P S Y - but P is allowed
- C O P S Y - but P is allowed
- F O P S Y - P is allowed
- G O P S Y - P is allowed

""BOPSY"" seems like a valid word (a variant of ""bopsy"" or a surname), but let's check if any letters are forbidden:
- B: allowed
- O: allowed
- P: allowed
- S: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits perfectly.

Another possibility: ""COBSY"" - but C is allowed.

""FOBSY"" - F is allowed.

But ""BOPSY"" is the most common-sounding word among these.

Thus, the correct next guess is ""BOPSY"".From the feedback on MOSSY we now know:
- The word is of the form _ O _ S Y (O in position 2, S in position 4, Y in position 5).
- Position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.
- Allowed letters for those positions are among B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""BOPSY"".

From the latest feedback on BOPSY:

B(x) O(✓) P(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)

1. B is NOT in the word (x).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓).
3. P is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓).
4. S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
5. Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓).

So the pattern is now fully determined: _ O P S Y

We only need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with a letter not yet ruled out and fits this pattern.

Forbidden letters accumulated so far:
L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K, U, N, D, M, B

Remaining possible first letters: C, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (and a few others, but these are the common ones).

Looking for common English words of the form X O P S Y:
- COPSY - but C is allowed
- FOPSY - F is allowed
- GOPSY - G is allowed
- JOPSY - J is allowed
- QOPSY - Q is allowed
- VOPSY - V is allowed
- WOPSY - W is allowed
- XOPSY - X is allowed
- ZOPSY - Z is allowed

The most common-sounding word here is ""COPSY"", but let me check if it's a valid word. ""COPSY"" is actually a valid English word (a surname). However, let me think of more common words.

Another possibility: ""GOPSY"" - but G is allowed.

""FOPSY"" - F is allowed.

""WOPSY"" - W is allowed.

""VOPSY"" - V is allowed.

Among these, ""VOPSY"" seems like a reasonable guess.

But wait, let me think of more common words. The pattern _ O P S Y is quite restrictive. 

Another check: ""ZOPSY"" - Z is allowed.

But the most common-sounding word here is ""COPSY"".

However, let me reconsider - the word must be _ O P S Y with:
- Position 1: any of the remaining allowed letters
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

Looking at valid English words, ""COPSY"" is actually a valid surname. Given that this seems to be the only possible word left, I will go with ""COPSY"".

But let me double-check:
- C: allowed
- O: correct position
- P: correct position
- S: correct position
- Y: correct position

This fits perfectly.
