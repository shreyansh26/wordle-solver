### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. This will give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so it can’t be in position 2).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. No O, S, E anywhere.

I want a word that:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Places R in a new position (3, 4, or 5).
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated (T, I, N, L, D, etc.).
- Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- A is in position 1 (✓).
- R is in position 2 (new position, but we know R can’t be in position 2 from feedback, so this is actually invalid).  
Oops—R was in position 2 in AROSE and got “-”, so R cannot be in position 2 again. So “TRAIN” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRANE” – but E is eliminated.
“GRANT” – but T is okay, N is okay, but let’s see if we can use more common letters.

Better: “DRANK” – D, R, A, N, K. A is fixed in position 1, R is in position 2 (invalid again).

Wait—R can’t be in position 2. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try “AFTER” – but E is eliminated.
“ALARM” – but M is okay, but R is in position 4 (valid), A is in position 1 (✓), and we have L and M to test.

But we already know A is in position 1, so “ALARM” would test A in position 4 (but we already know A is only in position 1). So “ALARM” is invalid because A is duplicated.

Next: “ABORT” – O is eliminated.
“ABRID” – not a valid word.
“ABRUT” – not valid.
“ABRYS” – S is eliminated.

Let’s try “ABRIN” – but I and N are okay, but is “ABRIN” a valid word? Not common.

“ABRUT” – invalid.
“ABRAS” – S eliminated.
“ABRID” – not a word.

Let’s try “ARIAH” – but A is in position 1, R in position 2 (invalid).
“ARIAL” – R in position 2 (invalid).

“AROMA” – O is eliminated.

“ARIA” – too short.

A _ _ _ _
R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
No O, S, E.

Let’s try a word that uses two new common letters in those spots.  
“ANTRE” uses N and T but E is eliminated.  
“APART” uses P and T but has two A’s (invalid).

“ARUMP” isn’t a word.  
“ARVOR” uses V and O but O is eliminated.  
“ARTSY” uses T and Y – both valid and untested.

“ARTSY” fits: A(✓) _ R(✓) _ Y, and tests T and S (but S is eliminated).  
Oops, S is already out, so “ARTSY” is invalid.

Next: “ARTLY” – uses T and L, both valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. This will give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so it can’t be in position 2).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. No O, S, E anywhere.

I want a word that:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Places R in a new position (3, 4, or 5).
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated (T, I, N, L, D, etc.).
- Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- A is in position 1 (✓).
- R is in position 2 (new position, but we know R can’t be in position 2 from feedback, so this is actually invalid).  
Oops—R was in position 2 in AROSE and got “-”, so R cannot be in position 2 again. So “TRAIN” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRANE” – but E is eliminated.
“GRANT” – but T is okay, N is okay, but let’s see if we can use more common letters.

Better: “DRANK” – D, R, A, N, K. A is fixed in position 1, R is in position 2 (invalid again).

Wait—R can’t be in position 2. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try “AFTER” – but E is eliminated.
“ALARM” – but M is okay, but R is in position 4 (valid), A is in position 1 (✓), and we have L and M to test.

But we already know A is in position 1, so “ALARM” would test A in position 4 (but we already know A is only in position 1). So “ALARM” is invalid because A is duplicated.

Next: “ABORT” – O is eliminated.
“ABRID” – not a valid word.
“ABRUT” – not valid.
“ABRYS” – S is eliminated.

Let’s try “ABRIN” – but I and N are okay, but is “ABRIN” a valid word? Not common.

“ABRUT” – invalid.
“ABRAS” – S eliminated.
“ABRID” – not a word.

Let’s try “ARIAH” – but A is in position 1, R in position 2 (invalid).
“ARIAL” – R in position 2 (invalid).

“AROMA” – O is eliminated.
“ARIAH” – R in position 2 (invalid).

“ARIA” – too short.

“ABRUT” – invalid.

Let me systematically construct:
A _ _ _ _
R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
No O, S, E.

Possible letters left: T, I, N, L, D, C, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try:
A T R I N – “ATRIN” – not a word.
A T R I D – “ATRID” – not a word.
A T R I C – “ATRIC” – not a word.
A T R I L – “ATRIL” – not a word.
A T R I H – “ATRIH” – not a word.

Let me try R in position 3:
A _ R _ _
Valid words: A C R I D, A F R I D, A G R I D, A H R I D, A M R I D, A P R I D, A T R I D, A W R I D, A Y R I D.

“ACRID” – valid word, uses C, R, I, D. A is position 1, R is position 3 (valid), and tests C, I, D.

This seems good.

   - From ACRID: C, I, D

Letters still allowed (besides A and R in their fixed spots):  
T, N, L, G, H, M, P, U, Y, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 5.  
To maximize information, pick common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.
