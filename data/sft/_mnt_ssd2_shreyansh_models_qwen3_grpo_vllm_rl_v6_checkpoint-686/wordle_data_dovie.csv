For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why these are good choices:
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 of the most common letters
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - also excellent, but AROSE might give slightly more vowel info

I'll choose AROSE for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, R, or S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.

Let me think of words ending in E with O not in position 3:
- DOPEY (but has Y, and O is in position 2 - allowed)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- TONER (but R is excluded)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- GONER (R excluded)
- LONER (R excluded)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Wait, let me think of words where O is in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 1 or 4.

Examples:
- OCEAN (but A is excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (but I and N are allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)
- OPIUM (but U is allowed, but O is in position 1, which is allowed)

Actually, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (but C, L, O, V, E - O is in position 3, which is invalid)
- BLOKE (O in position 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- GLOVE (G, L, O, V, E - O in position 3 - invalid)
- FOYER (R excluded)
- DOPEY (O in position 2 - allowed, ends with Y, but we need E)

Wait, I need to ensure O is not in position 3. Let me try:

- CONEY (O in position 2)
- MONEY (O in position 2)

Actually, let me try a word with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (I, N, P allowed)
- OPIUM (U allowed)

- BLOKE (O in 3 - invalid)
- GLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)

This seems tricky. Let me try a word with O in position 2:

- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (ends with E, O in 1, P, I, N allowed)
- OPIUM (ends with M, not E)

Actually, let me try ""OPINE"" - it has O in position 1, P, I, N, E. This seems valid:
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 1, not 3)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why these are good choices:
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 of the most common letters
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - also excellent, but AROSE might give slightly more vowel info

I'll choose AROSE for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, R, or S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.

Let me think of words ending in E with O not in position 3:
- DOPEY (but has Y, and O is in position 2 - allowed)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- TONER (but R is excluded)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- GONER (R excluded)
- LONER (R excluded)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Wait, let me think of words where O is in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 1 or 4.

Examples:
- OCEAN (but A is excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (but I and N are allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)
- OPIUM (but U is allowed, but O is in position 1, which is allowed)

Actually, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (but C, L, O, V, E - O is in position 3, which is invalid)
- BLOKE (O in position 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- GLOVE (G, L, O, V, E - O in position 3 - invalid)
- FOYER (R excluded)
- DOPEY (O in position 2 - allowed, ends with Y, but we need E)

Wait, I need to ensure O is not in position 3. Let me try:
- TONER (R excluded)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Actually, let me try a word with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (I, N, P allowed)
- OPIUM (U allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)

Hmm, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- BLOKE (O in 3 - invalid)
- GLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- FLOTE (but T is allowed, F, L, O, T, E - O in 3 - invalid)

This seems tricky. Let me try a word with O in position 2:
- DOPEY (but ends with Y, not E)
- CONEY (ends with Y)
- MONEY (ends with Y)
- HONEY (ends with Y)

Wait, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (ends with E, O in 1, P, I, N allowed)
- OPIUM (ends with M, not E)
- OTTER (R excluded)

Actually, let me try ""OPINE"" - it has O in position 1, P, I, N, E. This seems valid:
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 1, not 3)
- Uses common letters P, I, N

This seems like a good second guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why these are good choices:
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 of the most common letters
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - also excellent, but AROSE might give slightly more vowel info

I'll choose AROSE for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, R, or S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.

Let me think of words ending in E with O not in position 3:
- DOPEY (but has Y, and O is in position 2 - allowed)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- TONER (but R is excluded)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- GONER (R excluded)
- LONER (R excluded)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Wait, let me think of words where O is in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 1 or 4.

Examples:
- OCEAN (but A is excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (but I and N are allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)
- OPIUM (but U is allowed, but O is in position 1, which is allowed)

Actually, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (but C, L, O, V, E - O is in position 3, which is invalid)
- BLOKE (O in position 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- GLOVE (G, L, O, V, E - O in position 3 - invalid)
- FOYER (R excluded)
- DOPEY (O in position 2 - allowed, ends with Y, but we need E)

Wait, I need to ensure O is not in position 3. Let me try:
- TONER (R excluded)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Actually, let me try a word with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (I, N, P allowed)
- OPIUM (U allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)

Hmm, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- BLOKE (O in 3 - invalid)
- GLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- FLOTE (but T is allowed, F, L, O, T, E - O in 3 - invalid)

This seems tricky. Let me try a word with O in position 2:
- DOPEY (but ends with Y, not E)
- CONEY (ends with Y)
- MONEY (ends with Y)
- HONEY (ends with Y)

Wait, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (ends with E, O in 1, P, I, N allowed)
- OPIUM (ends with M, not E)
- OTTER (R excluded)

Actually, let me try ""OPINE"" - it has O in position 1, P, I, N, E. This seems valid:
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 1, not 3)
- Uses common letters P, I, N

This seems like a good second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A, R, S are not in the word.

2. OPINE → O(-) P(x) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 1 (since it’s marked “-” here as well).
   - P and N are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, I, E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Letters definitely out: A, R, S, P, N.
- O cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for O: 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded).
Possible positions for I: 1,2,4 (since 3,5 are excluded).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ _ _ _ E
- O must be in 2 or 4.
- I must be in 1,2, or 4.
- Allowed consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try to place O in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ _ E
Then I must be in 1 or 4.
- I O _ _ E: I O _ _ E → possible word: “VOICE” (but C is allowed, V, O, I, C, E) – but O is in 2, I in 3 is invalid (I cannot be in 3). So “VOICE” is invalid because I would be in 3.
- _ O I _ E: C O I D E → “COIDE” – not a valid word.
- _ O _ I E: B O U N E – but N is excluded.
- _ O _ _ I E – impossible (only 5 letters).

Try placing O in position 4:
Pattern: _ _ _ O E
Then I must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is O), so I must be in 1 or 2.
- I _ _ O E: I _ _ O E → possible word: “ICONE” (but N is excluded).
- _ I _ O E: B I D O E – not a word.
- _ _ I O E: C H I O E – not a word.

Let me think of actual words:
- “VOICE” – invalid (I in 3).
- “CHOKE” – has K (allowed), C, H, O, K, E – but O is in 3, which is invalid.
- “FOYEL” – ends with L, not E.
- “DOZER” – R excluded.
- “LODGE” – has D, G, E, but O in 2, I missing.
- “MIDGE” – has D, G, E, I in 3 – invalid (I cannot be in 3).
- “WIDOW” – ends with W, not E.
- “JOKEE” – J, O, K, E, E – but O in 2, I missing.
- “BOGIE” – B, O, G, I, E – O in 2, I in 4. This fits:
   - Letters: B, O, G, I, E – none of the excluded letters.
   - O is in 2 (allowed).
   - I is in 4 (allowed).
   - E is in 5 (fixed).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why these are good choices:
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 of the most common letters
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - also excellent, but AROSE might give slightly more vowel info

I'll choose AROSE for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, R, or S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.

Let me think of words ending in E with O not in position 3:
- DOPEY (but has Y, and O is in position 2 - allowed)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- TONER (but R is excluded)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- GONER (R excluded)
- LONER (R excluded)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Wait, let me think of words where O is in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 1 or 4.

Examples:
- OCEAN (but A is excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (but I and N are allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)
- OPIUM (but U is allowed, but O is in position 1, which is allowed)

Actually, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (but C, L, O, V, E - O is in position 3, which is invalid)
- BLOKE (O in position 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- GLOVE (G, L, O, V, E - O in position 3 - invalid)
- FOYER (R excluded)
- DOPEY (O in position 2 - allowed, ends with Y, but we need E)

Wait, I need to ensure O is not in position 3. Let me try:
- TONER (R excluded)
- CONEY (O in position 2)
- MONEY (O in position 2)
- HONEY (O in position 2)

Actually, let me try a word with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (I, N, P allowed)
- OPIUM (U allowed)
- OTTER (R excluded)

Hmm, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 4:
- CLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- BLOKE (O in 3 - invalid)
- GLOVE (O in 3 - invalid)
- PROBE (R excluded)
- FLOTE (but T is allowed, F, L, O, T, E - O in 3 - invalid)

This seems tricky. Let me try a word with O in position 2:
- DOPEY (but ends with Y, not E)
- CONEY (ends with Y)
- MONEY (ends with Y)
- HONEY (ends with Y)

Wait, let me think of words ending in E with O in position 1:
- OCEAN (A excluded)
- OMEGA (A excluded)
- OPINE (ends with E, O in 1, P, I, N allowed)
- OPIUM (ends with M, not E)
- OTTER (R excluded)

Actually, let me try ""OPINE"" - it has O in position 1, P, I, N, E. This seems valid:
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 1, not 3)
- Uses common letters P, I, N

This seems like a good second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A, R, S are not in the word.

2. OPINE → O(-) P(x) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 1 (since it’s marked “-” here as well).
   - P and N are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, I, E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Letters definitely out: A, R, S, P, N.
- O cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for O: 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded).
Possible positions for I: 1,2,4 (since 3,5 are excluded).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ _ _ _ E
- O must be in 2 or 4.
- I must be in 1,2, or 4.
- Allowed consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try to place O in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ _ E
Then I must be in 1 or 4.
- I O _ _ E: I O _ _ E → possible word: “VOICE” (but C is allowed, V, O, I, C, E) – but O is in 2, I in 3 is invalid (I cannot be in 3). So “VOICE” is invalid because I would be in 3.
- _ O I _ E: C O I D E → “COIDE” – not a valid word.
- _ O _ I E: B O U N E – but N is excluded.
- _ O _ _ I E – impossible (only 5 letters).

Try placing O in position 4:
Pattern: _ _ _ O E
Then I must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is O), so I must be in 1 or 2.
- I _ _ O E: I _ _ O E → possible word: “ICONE” (but N is excluded).
- _ I _ O E: B I D O E – not a word.
- _ _ I O E: C H I O E – not a word.

Let me think of actual words:
- “VOICE” – invalid (I in 3).
- “CHOKE” – has K (allowed), C, H, O, K, E – but O is in 3, which is invalid.
- “FOYEL” – ends with L, not E.
- “DOZER” – R excluded.
- “LODGE” – has D, G, E, but O in 2, I missing.
- “MIDGE” – has D, G, E, I in 3 – invalid (I cannot be in 3).
- “WIDOW” – ends with W, not E.
- “JOKEE” – J, O, K, E, E – but O in 2, I missing.
- “BOGIE” – B, O, G, I, E – O in 2, I in 4. This fits:
   - Letters: B, O, G, I, E – none of the excluded letters.
   - O is in 2 (allowed).
   - I is in 4 (allowed).
   - E is in 5 (fixed).

“BOGIE” seems valid.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is fixed at position 5.  
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. OPINE → O(-) P(x) I(-) N(x) E(✓)  
   - P, N are out.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

- VOILE – same issue.  
- WOILE – invalid.  
- YOKE E – no.  
- ZOIE E – no.  

Actually, let me think of words with O in 2 and I in 4:  
- C O D I E – “CODIE” – not standard.  
- C O L I E – “COLIE” – archaic, but valid.  
- F O L I E – “FOLIE” – French loanword, but accepted in Scrabble.  
- H O L I E – “HOLIE” – archaic.  
- L O C I E – invalid.  
- M O L I E – invalid.  
- T O L I E – invalid.  

The most plausible real word fitting _ O _ I E is “FOLIE” (F-O-L-I-E), but it’s a loanword. Another is “COLIE”. However, “COLIE” is rare. 

Another check: “WOILE” – invalid.  
“DOILE” – invalid.  

Let me reconsider: maybe “CHOKE” is a misfit because K is in 4, but we need I in 4.  

Actually, the only common word fitting _ O _ I E is “TOILE” (T-O-I-L-E), but I is in 3, which is invalid.  

Wait, let me list all valid English 5-letter words with pattern _ O _ I E:

- CHOIE – invalid.  
- DOCIE – invalid.  
- FOCIE – invalid.  
- HOCIE – invalid.  
- JOCIE – invalid.  
- KOCIE – invalid.  
- LOCIE – invalid.  
- MOCIE – invalid.  
- ROCIE – invalid (R excluded).  
- TOCIE – invalid.  
- VOCIE – invalid.  
- WOCIE – invalid.  

None seem valid. Let me re-examine the constraints:

Pattern: _ O _ I E  
Letters allowed for position 1 and 3: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding used/excluded letters).  

Real word check:  
- C O D I E – “CODIE” – not standard.  
- C O L I E – “COLIE” – rare, but valid.  
- F O L I E – “FOLIE” – accepted in Scrabble.  
- H O L I E – “HOLIE” – archaic.  

“FOLIE” is the closest valid word.

From the four rounds we now have the exact pattern:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known:    _ O _ I E

Letters already ruled out (x):  
A, R, S, P, N, B, G, F, L

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3 (from the remaining alphabet):  
C, D, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form C O _ I E, D O _ I E, H O _ I E, etc.

Checking standard dictionaries, the only common English word that fits is:

C O D I E  →  “CODIE”  (an informal term for a codebreaker, also used in Scrabble lists)

All other combinations like D O _ I E, H O _ I E, etc., do not yield standard words.

Hence “CODIE” is the logical next guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\nAnother strong option is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters.
