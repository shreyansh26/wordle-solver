### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- Contains the letter S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

1. Has S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, E.

- Uses T, U, M, P which are all new letters not eliminated by previous feedback.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, M  
Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: S, U, P

So the secret word:
- Must contain S, U, P (each at least once).
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, M.
- S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STUMP feedback).
- U is not in position 3 (from STUMP feedback).
- P is not in position 5 (from STUMP feedback).

Remaining common consonants: N, L, D, C, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E, U are accounted for; note U is a vowel here).

We have 3 required letters (S, U, P) and need 2 more letters from the allowed set. A good candidate is “SOUND” but D is allowed and O is not. “SULKY” has L, K, Y allowed. “SPICY” has I, C, Y allowed. Let’s try “SPICY”:
- Contains S, P, I, C, Y.
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from STUMP feedback). So SPICY is invalid.

Next try “SULKY”:
- Contains S, U, L, K, Y.
- S in position 1 again – invalid.

Next try “PULSY”:
- Contains P, U, L, S, Y.
- S in position 4 – allowed (only position 4 was excluded in AROSE, but STUMP only excluded position 1 for S).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, E.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and includes S in a different position. A strong candidate is ""STUMP"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- Uses T, U, M, P which are all new letters not eliminated by previous feedback.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, M  
Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: S, U, P

So the secret word:
- Must contain S, U, P (each at least once).
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, M.
- S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STUMP feedback).
- U is not in position 3 (from STUMP feedback).
- P is not in position 5 (from STUMP feedback).

Remaining common consonants: N, L, D, C, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E, U are accounted for; note U is a vowel here).

We have 3 required letters (S, U, P) and need 2 more letters from the allowed set. A good candidate is “SOUND” but D is allowed and O is not. “SULKY” has L, K, Y allowed. “SPICY” has I, C, Y allowed. Let’s try “SPICY”:
- Contains S, P, I, C, Y.
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from STUMP feedback). So SPICY is invalid.

Next try “SULKY”:
- Contains S, U, L, K, Y.
- S in position 1 again – invalid.

Next try “PULSY”:
- Contains P, U, L, S, Y.
- S in position 4 – allowed (only position 4 was excluded in AROSE, but STUMP only excluded position 1 for S).
- P in position 1 – allowed (only position 5 was excluded for P).
- U in position 2 – allowed (only position 3 was excluded for U).

All letters are allowed and positions satisfy constraints. Let’s use PULSY.

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, E, T, M, Y

So the secret word looks like: P U L _ _

The fourth letter must be S (since S is in the word and the only remaining position for S is 4 or 5, but from PULSY feedback S is not in position 4). Therefore S must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be P U L _ S.

The missing letter (position 4) must be a letter not in the forbidden list and not already used (P, U, L, S). Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.
