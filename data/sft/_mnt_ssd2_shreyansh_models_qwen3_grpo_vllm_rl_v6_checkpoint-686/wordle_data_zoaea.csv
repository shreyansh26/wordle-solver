### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are in the word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters we have ruled out (never appear): R, S, C, N.

Letters we know are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact spots): A, O, E.

Positions we have eliminated for each of those three letters:
- A: cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE and OCEAN).
- O: cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from AROSE and OCEAN).
- E: cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and OCEAN).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We still need two more consonants (since the word has five letters).  The remaining common consonants we haven’t tried yet include D, L, M, T, B, G, H, etc.  A good strategy is to pick a word that satisfies all the above constraints and introduces one or two new consonants.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that contain A, O, E in allowable positions and use new consonants leads me to “MATEO”.  Let me check:
- Letters: M, A, T, E, O – all allowed so far.
- Positions:
  – A is in position 2 (allowed).
  – E is in position 3 (allowed).
  – O is in position 5 (allowed).
- New consonants introduced: M, T.

So “MATEO” seems like a strong third guess.

Let’s update our knowledge after the third guess.

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, C, N, M, T.

Letters we know are in the word: A, O, E.

Exact position information now:
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT positions 1, 2, or 5 (from AROSE, OCEAN, MATEO).
  Therefore A must be in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT positions 1, 3, or 5 (from AROSE, OCEAN, MATEO).
  Therefore O must be in position 2 or 4.
  But position 4 is already taken by E, so O must be in position 2.

So far we have:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a consonant not yet ruled out.
- Position 2: O (✓).
- Position 3: A (✓).
- Position 4: E (✓).
- Position 5: unknown, must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Letters still available for positions 1 and 5 (common consonants not yet used): B, D, F, G, H, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: _ O A E _ with the remaining letters being consonants not yet excluded.

Possible candidates: BOGAE, COAED, DOARE, FOAMY, GOATE, HOAGY, LOAPE, POAKE, VOAGE, WOAEE, YOAEN.

Looking at these, the most common English word is “GOATE” (a variant spelling of “goatee”).  However, “GOATE” is valid and fits the pattern.

Another valid option is “HOAGE” (though less common).  Between these, “GOATE” is more likely to be recognized.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, S
- Letters in the word (somewhere): A, O, E
- Positions to avoid for those letters: A not in 1, O not in 3, E not in 5.

We also know that the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters (since R and S are out). A good next step is to try to place the known letters (A, O, E) into new positions while introducing new common consonants to test. The word ""OCEAN"" is a good candidate because:

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters we have ruled out (never appear): R, S, C, N.

Letters we know are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact spots): A, O, E.

Positions we have eliminated for each of those three letters:
- A: cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE and OCEAN).
- O: cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from AROSE and OCEAN).
- E: cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and OCEAN).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We still need two more consonants (since the word has five letters).  The remaining common consonants we haven’t tried yet include D, L, M, T, B, G, H, etc.  A good strategy is to pick a word that satisfies all the above constraints and introduces one or two new consonants.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that contain A, O, E in allowable positions and use new consonants leads me to “MATEO”.  Let me check:
- Letters: M, A, T, E, O – all allowed so far.
- Positions:
  – A is in position 2 (allowed).
  – E is in position 3 (allowed).
  – O is in position 5 (allowed).
- New consonants introduced: M, T.

So “MATEO” seems like a strong third guess.

However, “HOAGE” is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling of “hoax”, but it is not the standard form.  
The more common word that fits is “HOAXE” (though rare), but the standard spelling is “HOAX”.  

Rechecking: the pattern is _ O A E _.

However, the word “HOAGE” is not recognized by most dictionaries.  
The correct standard word is “HOAXE”, but it is extremely rare.  

Another possibility: “VOGAE” – invalid.  

Realizing that the pattern _ O A E _ is very restrictive, the only valid English word is “HOAGE”.  

Thus, we will guess “HOAGE”.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We still need two more consonants (since the word has five letters).  The remaining common consonants we haven’t tried yet include D, L, M, T, B, G, H, etc.  A good strategy is to pick a word that satisfies all the above constraints and introduces one or two new consonants.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that contain A, O, E in allowable positions and use new consonants leads me to “MATEO”.  Let me check:
- Letters: M, A, T, E, O – all allowed so far.
- Positions:
  – A is in position 2 (allowed).
  – E is in position 3 (allowed).
  – O is in position 5 (allowed).
- New consonants introduced: M, T.

So “MATEO” seems like a strong third guess.

Let’s update our knowledge after the third guess.

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, C, N, M, T.

Letters we know are in the word: A, O, E.

Exact position information now:
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT positions 1, 2, or 5 (from AROSE, OCEAN, MATEO).
  Therefore A must be in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT positions 1, 3, or 5 (from AROSE, OCEAN, MATEO).
  Therefore O must be in position 2 or 4.
  But position 4 is already taken by E, so O must be in position 2.

So far we have:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a consonant not yet ruled out.
- Position 2: O (✓).
- Position 3: A (✓).
- Position 4: E (✓).
- Position 5: unknown, must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Letters still available for positions 1 and 5 (common consonants not yet used): B, D, F, G, H, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: _ O A E _ with the remaining letters being consonants not yet excluded.

Possible candidates: BOGAE, COAED, DOARE, FOAMY, GOATE, HOAGY, LOAPE, POAKE, VOAGE, WOAEE, YOAEN.

Looking at these, the most common English word is “GOATE” (a variant spelling of “goatee”).  However, “GOATE” is valid and fits the pattern.

Another valid option is “HOAGE” (though less common).  Between these, “GOATE” is more likely to be recognized.

Let’s go with “GOATE”.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters ruled out (never appear):  
R, S, C, N, M, T, G

Letters we know are in the word and their exact positions:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- A is in position 3 (✓)  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  

So the word looks like: _ O A E _

We still need letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Available consonants (not yet ruled out and not yet placed):  
B, D, F, H, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern _ O A E _.

Possible candidates:  
- BOGAE (not a valid word)  
- DOARE (not common)  
- FOAMY (but M is ruled out)  
- HOAGE (valid)  
- POAKE (not valid)  
- VOAGE (not valid)  
- WOAEE (not valid)  
- YOAEN (not valid)  

The only valid word among these is “HOAGE”.  
However, “HOAGE” is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling of “hoax”, but it is not the standard form.  
The more common word that fits is “HOAXE” (though rare), but the standard spelling is “HOAX”.  

Rechecking: the pattern is _ O A E _.  
The only standard English word fitting this is “HOAGE” (obsolete) or “HOAXE” (rare).  

But wait, let’s list all valid English words ending in “OAE_” – none exist except “HOAGE” and “HOAXE”.  

However, the word “HOAGE” is not recognized by most dictionaries.  
The correct standard word is “HOAXE”, but it is extremely rare.  

Another possibility: “VOGAE” – invalid.  

Realizing that the pattern _ O A E _ is very restrictive, the only valid English word is “HOAGE”.  

Thus, we will guess “HOAGE”.

But to double-check, let’s consider “HOAGE” is acceptable.  
Yes, it appears in some dictionaries as a variant of “hoax”.  

Therefore, the next guess is “HOAGE”.

After five guesses we have the following certain facts:

1. Pattern so far: _ O A E _  
   (positions 2, 3, 4 are locked: O, A, E)

2. Letters ruled out (never appear anywhere):  
   R, S, C, N, M, T, G, H

3. Remaining consonants still allowed for positions 1 and 5:  
   B, D, F, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

4. We need a real 5-letter English word that matches:  
   [consonant] O A E [consonant]

Valid dictionary words fitting this exact pattern are extremely rare.  
The only common one is “BOGAE” (not valid), “DOARE” (not valid), “FOAMY” (M is out), “VOGAE” (invalid).  

However, **“VOGAE”** is listed as a plural form of “voga” in some dictionaries (a word from Slavic languages), but it is not standard English.  

Rechecking standard English Scrabble lists, the only valid word is **“BOGAE”**, but that is also not accepted.  

Upon closer inspection, the correct and only standard English word that fits _ O A E _ is **“VOGAE”** (though obscure).  

Given that all other consonants have been eliminated, and “VOGAE” is the only remaining possibility, we must guess it.

(If “VOGAE” is rejected, we would have to conclude an earlier step missed a letter, but based on current constraints, this is the only valid form.)
