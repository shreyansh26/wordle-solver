For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- AROSE: Uses A, R, O, S, E (good coverage)
- SLATE: Uses S, L, A, T, E (good coverage)
- CRANE: Uses C, R, A, N, E (good coverage)
- ADIEU: Uses A, D, I, E, U (more vowels, but fewer consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A, R, and O, but not S or E. The letters A, R, and O must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since their current positions are marked wrong). I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A, R, and O.
2. Excludes S and E.
3. Avoids placing A in position 1, R in position 2, or O in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, R, O, plus consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. (since S and E are out).

Let me think of words that fit:
- O is not in position 3, so possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5.
- A is not in position 1, so possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- R is not in position 2, so possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

A good candidate is ""RATIO"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was not in position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1).
- T is a new consonant.
- I is a new vowel (since E is out, but I is still possible).
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O was not in position 3).

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down positions further.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A, R, O are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - S, E are NOT in the word.

2. RATIO → R(-) A(-) T(-) I(x) O(-)
   - R, A, O are again marked “-”, confirming they are in the word but still in wrong positions.
   - T is now marked “-”, so T is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3).
   - I is NOT in the word.

So far we know the secret word contains: A, R, O, T and does NOT contain: S, E, I.

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word using A, R, O, T and one more letter (not S, E, I). The remaining common consonants are N, L, D, etc.

Let’s list possible positions for each known letter:
- A: positions 3, 4, 5
- R: positions 3, 4, 5
- O: positions 1, 2, 4
- T: positions 1, 2, 4, 5

A quick check of common 5-letter words that use A, R, O, T and one other consonant:
- “TROAP” – not a valid English word.
- “TORAN” – not valid.
- “TAROT” – uses T twice, but we don’t know if T appears twice.
- “ROATE” – contains E, which is banned.
- “ARTOT” – invalid.
- “TAROP” – invalid.
- “TORAH” – contains H, but we haven’t ruled H out; however, we have only 5 letters to work with.

Wait, let’s think differently: the word must contain A, R, O, T and one more letter (not S, E, I). The simplest candidate is “TAROT”, but it repeats T, and we don’t know if T appears twice. 

Another candidate: “TROOP” – but it repeats O and contains P, which hasn’t been ruled out. However, we already know O cannot be in position 5.

Let’s try “TROOP”:
- T (position 1): allowed (T not in position 3).
- R (position 2): not allowed (R cannot be in position 2).

Next, “ROTOR”:
- R (position 1): allowed.
- O (position 2): allowed.
- T (position 3): not allowed (T cannot be in position 3).

Next, “TORON” – not a valid word.

Next, “TAPOR” – not a valid word.

Next, “TAROT”:
- T (position 1): allowed.
- A (position 2): not allowed (A cannot be in position 2).

Next, “RATON” – not a valid word.

Next, “OCTAR” – not a valid word.

Next, “TRAMP” – contains M and P, which haven’t been ruled out, but we already know we must include A, R, O, T.

Wait, let’s list all required letters: A, R, O, T, and one more. The only way to form a valid 5-letter word is to have one of these letters appear twice. The most promising is “TAROT” (T twice) or “TOROT” (invalid). 

But “TAROT” is a valid word and uses T twice, and we have no information against T appearing twice. Let’s try “TAROT”.

However, let’s verify positions:
- T (position 1): allowed (T not in position 3).
- A (position 2): not allowed (A cannot be in position 2).

So “TAROT” is invalid because of A in position 2.

Next option: “TROAT” – not a valid word.

Next: “TORAH” – valid word, uses A, R, O, T, H. Check positions:
- T (1): allowed.
- O (2): allowed.
- R (3): allowed (R not in 1 or 2).
- A (4): allowed (A not in 1 or 2).
- H (5): new letter, allowed.

“TORAH” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Let me double-check:
- Contains A, R, O, T.
- Does not contain S, E, I.
- Positions:
  - T (1): not ruled out.
  - O (2): not ruled out.
  - R (3): not ruled out.
  - A (4): not ruled out.
  - H (5): new letter, allowed.

Thus, “TORAH” is a strong candidate.
