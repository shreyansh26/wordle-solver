### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains five very common letters and can quickly reveal information about vowels and consonants. However, another excellent first guess is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""SLATE"" is slightly better because it includes the letter T which appears in many 5-letter words, and the combination S-L-A-T-E is statistically likely to hit multiple letters in the secret word. This will give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word pattern is S L _ _ _ and the remaining letters cannot include A, T, or E.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc. Since we have two letters already, we need three more. Let’s pick common combinations. The sequence SL-... is common in words like SLING, SLUMP, SLICK, etc. 

Let’s try ""SLING"":
- S and L are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- I is a common vowel not yet tested.
- N and G are common consonants not yet tested.

This should give us good information about whether the word contains I, N, or G, and where they might fit.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - First two letters are S and L in positions 1 and 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SLING → S(✓) L(✓) I(x) N(x) G(-)
   - S and L confirmed again in positions 1 and 2.
   - I and N are not in the word.
   - G is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S L _ _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, T, E, I, N
- G must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 5, so positions 3 or 4).

Possible remaining letters (excluding A, T, E, I, N): B, C, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need three more letters, with G appearing once in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try a word that places G in position 3 and uses common remaining consonants. A good candidate is ""SLUGS"":
- S and L confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- G in position 3 (testing if G is here).
- U and S are unused so far; U is a vowel we haven't tested, and S is already confirmed in position 1 but can appear again.

However, ""SLUGS"" has S in position 5 which might be redundant. Let’s try ""SLUGS"" anyway to test G in position 3.

But wait, let’s think of a better word: ""SLUMG"" isn't valid. ""SLUGS"" is valid. Alternatively, ""SLUGS"" is okay.

Another option: ""SLUGS"" is valid and tests G in position 3. Let’s go with that.

But actually, ""SLUGS"" has S in position 5 which might not be helpful. Let’s try ""SLUGS"" and see.

Wait, let’s think of ""SLUGS"" as a valid guess. It will test:
- G in position 3 (which is allowed)
- U in position 4
- S in position 5 (but S is already confirmed in position 1, so this is acceptable)

But we might want to test different consonants. Let’s try ""SLUGS"" first.

Alternatively, ""SLUGS"" is fine. Let’s proceed with ""SLUGS"".

But actually, let’s think of a word that places G in position 4. For example, ""SLYGS"" isn't valid. ""SLUMG"" isn't valid. ""SLUGS"" seems to be the only valid word with G in position 3.
