### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- Good letter positioning that can help identify correct placements

This gives us a broad initial test of the secret word's letters and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (✓) → O is in the word, but not 3rd
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 5th letter is E

We need to test letters that fit these patterns. Common consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels left: I, U (since A is out).

Let's try a word that places O in 4th position and tests new consonants: ""TROVE""
- T: new consonant
- R: confirmed 2nd
- O: placed in 4th (testing if this is correct)

This gives us new info on T, V, and confirms O's position if 4th is correct.

2. TROVE → T(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
3. CRONE → C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

- The word is C R O _ E (positions 1,2,3,5 are locked).
- The only remaining unknown is the 4th letter.
- Letters already ruled out: A, S, T, V, N.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern C R O _ E.
