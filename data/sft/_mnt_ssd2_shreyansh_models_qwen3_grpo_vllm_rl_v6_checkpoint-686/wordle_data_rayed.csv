For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have no repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination tests 5 unique, high-frequency letters across different positions, giving us good coverage for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
- DOES contain A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids S, L, T entirely.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains both A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 1 (not 5) – satisfies the feedback.
- Uses letters not ruled out: E, A, R, L, Y. (Note: L was ruled out in SLATE, so this would actually be invalid.)

Oops – ""EARLY"" uses L, which is excluded. Let's try ""PEACH"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next try ""CREAM"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 4 (valid, since it wasn't in position 3).
- E is in position 2 (valid, since it wasn't in position 5).
- Letters: C, R, E, A, M – none of S, L, T appear.
This seems valid.

""CREAM"" is a strong next guess.

3. Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
4. Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, C, M).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have no repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination tests 5 unique, high-frequency letters across different positions, giving us good coverage for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
- DOES contain A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids S, L, T entirely.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains both A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 1 (not 5) – satisfies the feedback.
- Uses letters not ruled out: E, A, R, L, Y. (Note: L was ruled out in SLATE, so this would actually be invalid.)

Oops – ""EARLY"" uses L, which is excluded. Let's try ""PEACH"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next try ""CREAM"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 4 (valid, since it wasn't in position 3).
- E is in position 2 (valid, since it wasn't in position 5).
- Letters: C, R, E, A, M – none of S, L, T appear.
This seems valid.

""CREAM"" is a strong next guess.

Guess 2: CREAM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE  
S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)  
→ Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T  
→ Letters IN the word (wrong positions): A, E  

Round 2: CREAM  
C(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) M(x)  
→ Letters NOT in the word: C, M (added to S, L, T)  
→ Letters IN the word (wrong positions): R, E, A  

So far we know:
- The word definitely contains A, E, R.  
- It does NOT contain S, L, T, C, M.  
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 4 (from CREAM).  
- E is not in position 2 (from CREAM) and not in position 5 (from SLATE).  
- R is not in position 2 (from CREAM).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, E, R exactly once each.  
2. Places A in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
3. Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
4. Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, C, M).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible remaining vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but we already know A and E are in the word; the word has 5 letters and we have 3 letters locked in: A, E, R).

Let’s try to place A, E, R and fill the remaining two slots with unused consonants.

One promising pattern:  
A _ E R _  
→ A in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4.  
Need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, avoiding ruled-out letters.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s pick B and N:  
A B E R N → “ABERN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next try:  
E A R _ _  
→ E in position 1, A in position 2, R in position 3.  
Need letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Try E A R G Y → “EARGY” – not valid.

Try E A R L Y – but L is ruled out.

Try E A R N D – “EARN D” – not valid.

Try A R E _ _  
→ A in 1, R in 2, E in 3.  
Need letters for 4 and 5.  
A R E B Y → “AREBY” – not valid.

Try A R E N D – “A R E N D” – not valid.

Try A E R _ _  
→ A in 1, E in 2, R in 3.  
Need letters for 4 and 5.  
A E R B Y → “AERBY” – not valid.

Try _ A E R _  
→ Position 1: any unused consonant, positions 2-5: A, E, R.  
Need a valid word.  
Let’s list 5-letter words with A, E, R and no S, L, T, C, M.

Looking at common words:  
- “BREAD” – contains D, but we don’t know about D yet.  
  Check positions:  
  B R E A D → B(new), R(position 2 – ok), E(position 3 – ok), A(position 4 – but feedback says A is not in position 4 from CREAM). So invalid.  

- “BRAVE” – V is allowed.  
  B R A V E → A is in position 3 – but feedback says A is not in position 3. Invalid.

- “GRAPE” – G, P, A, E, but only 4 letters so far.  
  G R A P E → A in position 3 – invalid.  

- “DARES” – S is ruled out.  

- “PEARS” – S is ruled out.  

- “WAGER” – G, W, A, E, R.  
  W A G E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5.  
  Check positions:  
  A is allowed in 2 (not ruled out).  
  E is allowed in 4 (not ruled out).  
  R is allowed in 5 (not ruled out).  
  Letters used: W, A, G, E, R – none are ruled out.  
  “WAGER” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:  
- Contains A, E, R.  
- A not in 3 or 4.  
- E not in 2 or 5.  
- R not in 2.  
- No S, L, T, C, M.

- S, L, T, C, M, W, G are NOT in the word (from “x” feedback).

Positions locked so far:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- R is NOT in position 5 (-).

So the pattern is:
_ A _ E _

Letters still allowed: any not yet ruled out (so far only S, L, T, C, M, W, G are excluded). Remaining consonants include B, D, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus vowels I, O, U (but we already have A and E; the word has only 5 letters).

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3, with R somewhere in 1, 2, 3 (but 2 is A, so 1 or 3).

We also know R is NOT in position 5.

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A _ E _ and contain R exactly once, with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- B A R E D → but D is allowed, R is in 3.  
  Check: B, A, R, E, D – none are excluded.  
  Pattern: B A R E D → positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=E, 5=D.

- N A R E D → same, N allowed.  
- P A R E D → same, P allowed.  
- V A R E D → same, V allowed.  
- D A R E D → but R is in 3, D in 1 and 5 – but we can’t have D twice (each letter only once unless proven otherwise).  
  Assuming single occurrences, DARED is invalid (double D).  

Another candidate:  
B A R E N → but N is allowed, E is 4, R is 3.  
Check letters: B, A, R, E, N – all allowed.  
Valid word.

But let’s pick the most common one first: BARED.

Let’s verify:
- B (new), A (position 2 ✓), R (position 3 – allowed), E (position 4 ✓), D (new).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have no repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination tests 5 unique, high-frequency letters across different positions, giving us good coverage for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
- DOES contain A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids S, L, T entirely.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains both A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 1 (not 5) – satisfies the feedback.
- Uses letters not ruled out: E, A, R, L, Y. (Note: L was ruled out in SLATE, so this would actually be invalid.)

Oops – ""EARLY"" uses L, which is excluded. Let's try ""PEACH"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next try ""CREAM"":

- A is in position 4 (valid, since it wasn't in position 3).

2. Places A in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
3. Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
4. Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, C, M).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible remaining vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but we already know A and E are in the word; the word has 5 letters and we have 3 letters locked in: A, E, R).

Let’s try to place A, E, R and fill the remaining two slots with unused consonants.

One promising pattern:  
A _ E R _  
→ A in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4.  
Need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, avoiding ruled-out letters.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s pick B and N:  
A B E R N → “ABERN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next try:  
E A R _ _  
→ E in position 1, A in position 2, R in position 3.  
Need letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Try E A R G Y → “EARGY” – not valid.

Try E A R L Y – but L is ruled out.

Try E A R N D – “EARN D” – not valid.

Try A R E _ _  
→ A in 1, R in 2, E in 3.  
Need letters for 4 and 5.  
A R E B Y → “AREBY” – not valid.

Try A R E N D – “A R E N D” – not valid.

Try A E R _ _  
→ A in 1, E in 2, R in 3.  
Need letters for 4 and 5.  
A E R B Y → “AERBY” – not valid.

Try _ A E R _  
→ Position 1: any unused consonant, positions 2-5: A, E, R.  
Need a valid word.  
Let’s list 5-letter words with A, E, R and no S, L, T, C, M.

Looking at common words:  
- “BREAD” – contains D, but we don’t know about D yet.  
  Check positions:  
  B R E A D → B(new), R(position 2 – ok), E(position 3 – ok), A(position 4 – but feedback says A is not in position 4 from CREAM). So invalid.  

- “BRAVE” – V is allowed.  
  B R A V E → A is in position 3 – but feedback says A is not in position 3. Invalid.

- “GRAPE” – G, P, A, E, but only 4 letters so far.  
  G R A P E → A in position 3 – invalid.  

- “DARES” – S is ruled out.  

- “PEARS” – S is ruled out.  

- “WAGER” – G, W, A, E, R.  
  W A G E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5.  
  Check positions:  
  A is allowed in 2 (not ruled out).  
  E is allowed in 4 (not ruled out).  
  R is allowed in 5 (not ruled out).  
  Letters used: W, A, G, E, R – none are ruled out.  
  “WAGER” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:  
- Contains A, E, R.  
- A not in 3 or 4.  
- E not in 2 or 5.  
- R not in 2.  
- No S, L, T, C, M.  

Looks good.

Let’s extract every constraint from the three rounds.

Known letters:
- A, E, R are in the word (from “-” feedback).
- S, L, T, C, M, W, G are NOT in the word (from “x” feedback).

Positions locked so far:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- R is NOT in position 5 (-).

So the pattern is:
_ A _ E _

Letters still allowed: any not yet ruled out (so far only S, L, T, C, M, W, G are excluded). Remaining consonants include B, D, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus vowels I, O, U (but we already have A and E; the word has only 5 letters).

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3, with R somewhere in 1, 2, 3 (but 2 is A, so 1 or 3).

We also know R is NOT in position 5.

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A _ E _ and contain R exactly once, with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- B A R E D → but D is allowed, R is in 3.  
  Check: B, A, R, E, D – none are excluded.  
  Pattern: B A R E D → positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=E, 5=D.  
  R is in 3 – allowed.  
  Valid word.

- F A R E D → same structure, F allowed.  
- H A R E D → same, H allowed.  
- N A R E D → same, N allowed.  
- P A R E D → same, P allowed.  
- V A R E D → same, V allowed.  
- D A R E D → but R is in 3, D in 1 and 5 – but we can’t have D twice (each letter only once unless proven otherwise).  
  Assuming single occurrences, DARED is invalid (double D).  

Another candidate:  
B A R E N → but N is allowed, E is 4, R is 3.  
Check letters: B, A, R, E, N – all allowed.  
Valid word.

But let’s pick the most common one first: BARED.

Let’s verify:
- B (new), A (position 2 ✓), R (position 3 – allowed), E (position 4 ✓), D (new).  
- No excluded letters.  
- R is not in 5.  
- A and E are in correct positions.

Looks solid.

  - RA IED: not a word
  - RA KED: not a word
  - RA NED: not a word
  - RA P E D: valid (raped)
  - RA V E D: valid (raved)

- _ A R E D: but position 3 would be R, but D is already at 5. This would be _ A R E D, but we know D is at 5, so this would be _ A R E D which is 5 letters. But then positions would be: 1, A, R, E, D. This is actually the same as R A _ E D when R is in position 1. So we need to check if R is in 1 or 3.

Looking at the feedback:
- R was marked (-) in positions 2 (CREAM), 3 (WAGER), and 3 (BARED). This means R is not in positions 2 or 3. Therefore R must be in position 1.

So the word must be R A _ E D with R in 1, A in 2, E in 4, D in 5, and position 3 being a new letter.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have no repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination tests 5 unique, high-frequency letters across different positions, giving us good coverage for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
- DOES contain A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids S, L, T entirely.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains both A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 1 (not 5) – satisfies the feedback.
- Uses letters not ruled out: E, A, R, L, Y. (Note: L was ruled out in SLATE, so this would actually be invalid.)

Oops – ""EARLY"" uses L, which is excluded. Let's try ""PEACH"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next try ""CREAM"":
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 4 (valid, since it wasn't in position 3).
- E is in position 2 (valid, since it wasn't in position 5).
- Letters: C, R, E, A, M – none of S, L, T appear.
This seems valid.

""CREAM"" is a strong next guess.

- E is not in position 2 (from CREAM) and not in position 5 (from SLATE).  
- R is not in position 2 (from CREAM).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, E, R exactly once each.  
2. Places A in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
3. Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
4. Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, C, M).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible remaining vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but we already know A and E are in the word; the word has 5 letters and we have 3 letters locked in: A, E, R).

Let’s try to place A, E, R and fill the remaining two slots with unused consonants.

One promising pattern:  
A _ E R _  
→ A in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4.  
Need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, avoiding ruled-out letters.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s pick B and N:  
A B E R N → “ABERN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next try:  
E A R _ _  
→ E in position 1, A in position 2, R in position 3.  
Need letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Try E A R G Y → “EARGY” – not valid.

Try E A R L Y – but L is ruled out.

Try E A R N D – “EARN D” – not valid.

Try A R E _ _  
→ A in 1, R in 2, E in 3.  
Need letters for 4 and 5.  
A R E B Y → “AREBY” – not valid.

Try A R E N D – “A R E N D” – not valid.

Try A E R _ _  
→ A in 1, E in 2, R in 3.  
Need letters for 4 and 5.  
A E R B Y → “AERBY” – not valid.

Try _ A E R _  
→ Position 1: any unused consonant, positions 2-5: A, E, R.  
Need a valid word.  
Let’s list 5-letter words with A, E, R and no S, L, T, C, M.

Looking at common words:  
- “BREAD” – contains D, but we don’t know about D yet.  
  Check positions:  
  B R E A D → B(new), R(position 2 – ok), E(position 3 – ok), A(position 4 – but feedback says A is not in position 4 from CREAM). So invalid.  

- “BRAVE” – V is allowed.  
  B R A V E → A is in position 3 – but feedback says A is not in position 3. Invalid.

- “GRAPE” – G, P, A, E, but only 4 letters so far.  
  G R A P E → A in position 3 – invalid.  

- “DARES” – S is ruled out.  

- “PEARS” – S is ruled out.  

- “WAGER” – G, W, A, E, R.  
  W A G E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5.  
  Check positions:  
  A is allowed in 2 (not ruled out).  
  E is allowed in 4 (not ruled out).  
  R is allowed in 5 (not ruled out).  
  Letters used: W, A, G, E, R – none are ruled out.  
  “WAGER” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:  
- Contains A, E, R.  
- A not in 3 or 4.  
- E not in 2 or 5.  
- R not in 2.  
- No S, L, T, C, M.  

Looks good.

Let’s extract every constraint from the three rounds.

Known letters:
- A, E, R are in the word (from “-” feedback).
- S, L, T, C, M, W, G are NOT in the word (from “x” feedback).

Positions locked so far:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- R is NOT in position 5 (-).

So the pattern is:
_ A _ E _

Letters still allowed: any not yet ruled out (so far only S, L, T, C, M, W, G are excluded). Remaining consonants include B, D, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus vowels I, O, U (but we already have A and E; the word has only 5 letters).

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3, with R somewhere in 1, 2, 3 (but 2 is A, so 1 or 3).

We also know R is NOT in position 5.

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A _ E _ and contain R exactly once, with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- B A R E D → but D is allowed, R is in 3.  
  Check: B, A, R, E, D – none are excluded.  
  Pattern: B A R E D → positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=E, 5=D.  
  R is in 3 – allowed.  
  Valid word.

- F A R E D → same structure, F allowed.  
- H A R E D → same, H allowed.  
- N A R E D → same, N allowed.  
- P A R E D → same, P allowed.  
- V A R E D → same, V allowed.  
- D A R E D → but R is in 3, D in 1 and 5 – but we can’t have D twice (each letter only once unless proven otherwise).  
  Assuming single occurrences, DARED is invalid (double D).  

Another candidate:  
B A R E N → but N is allowed, E is 4, R is 3.  
Check letters: B, A, R, E, N – all allowed.  
Valid word.

But let’s pick the most common one first: BARED.

Let’s verify:
- B (new), A (position 2 ✓), R (position 3 – allowed), E (position 4 ✓), D (new).  
- No excluded letters.  
- R is not in 5.  
- A and E are in correct positions.

Looks solid.

Let's update all constraints after the fourth guess.

Known letters that are definitely in the word:
- A (position 2 ✓)
- E (position 4 ✓)
- R (must be present, but not in position 3 or 5)
- D (position 5 ✓)

So the pattern is:
_ A _ E D

Letters still allowed: any not yet ruled out (S, L, T, C, M, W, G, B are excluded). Remaining consonants include F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z. Vowels left: I, O, U.

We need one more letter for position 1 or 3. But R must be placed somewhere. The only remaining positions for R are 1 or 3 (positions 2,4,5 are taken by A,E,D).

Let's list possible words fitting _ A _ E D with R in 1 or 3:

- R A _ E D: need a letter for position 3. Possible: R A I E D, R A K E D, R A N E D, R A P E D, R A V E D. Check which are valid words.
  - RA IED: not a word
  - RA KED: not a word
  - RA NED: not a word
  - RA P E D: valid (raped)
  - RA V E D: valid (raved)

- _ A R E D: but position 3 would be R, but D is already at 5. This would be _ A R E D, but we know D is at 5, so this would be _ A R E D which is 5 letters. But then positions would be: 1, A, R, E, D. This is actually the same as R A _ E D when R is in position 1. So we need to check if R is in 1 or 3.

Looking at the feedback:
- R was marked (-) in positions 2 (CREAM), 3 (WAGER), and 3 (BARED). This means R is not in positions 2 or 3. Therefore R must be in position 1.

So the word must be R A _ E D with R in 1, A in 2, E in 4, D in 5, and position 3 being a new letter.

From the valid words: R A P E D, R A V E D. Both are valid. Let's choose R A P E D as it's more common.

Check letters: R, A, P, E, D. All allowed (P hasn't been tested yet and isn't excluded).
