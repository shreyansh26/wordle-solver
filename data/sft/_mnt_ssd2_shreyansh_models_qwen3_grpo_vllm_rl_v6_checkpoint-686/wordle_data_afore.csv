For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct letters that appear frequently. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us maximum coverage for the first attempt.

- A is correct in position 1.

- Word pattern: A _ O _ E
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, but position 3 is already O, and position 5 is E, so R must be in position 4.
- Therefore, the word is A _ O R E.

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that fits A _ O R E. The blank must be a letter that has not been ruled out yet (not S, and not A, O, R, E). Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for words fitting A _ O R E:
- AFORE (but F is possible)
- AGONE (but N is possible)
- AMORE (M is possible)
- ANORE (N is possible)
- ADORE (D is possible)
- AFORE, ADORE, AGONE, AMORE, ANORE are all valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct letters that appear frequently. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us maximum coverage for the first attempt.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is correct in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ O _ E
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, but position 3 is already O, and position 5 is E, so R must be in position 4.
- Therefore, the word is A _ O R E.

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that fits A _ O R E. The blank must be a letter that has not been ruled out yet (not S, and not A, O, R, E). Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for words fitting A _ O R E:
- AFORE (but F is possible)
- AGONE (but N is possible)
- AMORE (M is possible)
- ANORE (N is possible)
- ADORE (D is possible)
- AFORE, ADORE, AGONE, AMORE, ANORE are all valid.

Among these, ""ADORE"" uses D, which is a common letter and hasn't been used yet. Let's go with that.

Key deductions:
- Positions 1, 3, 5 are fixed: A _ O _ E
- Position 4 is now confirmed to be R (from adore feedback)
- Therefore the word is A _ O R E
- The only remaining unknown is position 2
- Letters already ruled out for position 2: D (from adore), S (from arose), and also A, O, R, E (they appear elsewhere in the word)
- High-frequency unused letters for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words matching A _ O R E:
- AFORE (F is possible)
- AGONE (G is possible)
- AMORE (M is possible)
- ANORE (N is possible)
- ADORE has been ruled out (D is not in word)

3. afroe → A(✓) F(✓) R(-) O(-) E(✓)
4. afire → A(✓) F(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(✓)

Key deductions:
- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed: A F _ R E
- Position 3 is the only unknown.
- Letters already ruled out for position 3: I (from afire), S (from arose), D (from adore), F (already in position 2), A (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), E (position 5)
- So position 3 must be a letter not yet used in any of these positions: B, C, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words matching A F _ R E:
- AFIRE (I is ruled out)
- AFORE (O is ruled out)
- AFIRE already ruled out
- AFORE ruled out
- AF...RE - the only remaining common word is AFIRE and AFORE, both ruled out
- This implies we might have missed another possibility: AF...RE

Wait, let's list all possible letters left for position 3:
Allowed letters: B, C, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Looking for words:
- AF...RE with these letters:
  - AF B R E → AFBRE (not valid)
  - AF C R E → AFCRE (not valid)
  - AF G R E → AFGRE (not valid)
  - AF H R E → AFHRE (not valid)
  - AF L R E → AFLRE (not valid)
  - AF M R E → AFMRE (not valid)
  - AF N R E → AFNRE (not valid)
  - AF P R E → AF PRE (not valid)
  - AF T R E → AFTRE (not valid)
  - AF U R E → AFURE (not valid)
  - AF V R E → AFVRE (not valid)
  - AF W R E → AFWRE (not valid)
  - AF Y R E → AFYRE (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid words. This suggests we might have made an error in interpretation. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From afire: A(✓) F(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(✓)
- This means:
  - A is correct in position 1
  - F is correct in position 2
  - I is not in the word (x)
  - R is correct in position 4
  - E is correct in position 5

Thus the word structure is A F _ R E with position 3 being the only unknown, and I is ruled out for position 3.

Looking up 5-letter words starting with AF and ending with RE:
- AFIRE (but I is ruled out)
- AFORE (but O is ruled out)
- AFIRE and AFORE are the only two, both ruled out by current feedback

This implies there might be no valid word left, but since the game guarantees a valid word exists, I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback for any possible misinterpretation.

Wait, looking back at afroe feedback: A(✓) F(✓) R(-) O(-) E(✓)
- This means O is in the word but not in position 4 (which aligns with O being in position 3)

From afire: I is not in the word, so position 3 cannot be I (already knew)
From arose: S is not in the word
From adore: D is not in the word

Thus position 3 must be a letter not yet used in any position and not ruled out. The only remaining common letter is B, giving AFBRE (invalid), or C, etc.

But none of these are valid. This suggests the word must be AFORE, but O is ruled out for position 3 from afroe feedback? Wait no: afroe feedback says O is in the word but not in position 4, so O can be in position 3. But AFORE has O in position 3, but in afroe O was in position 4 and got (-), so O cannot be in position 4 but can be in position 3. Thus AFORE is possible.

But in AFORE, position 3 is O, which was in position 4 in afroe and got (-), so O cannot be in position 4 but can be in position 3. Thus AFORE is possible.

But in AFORE, the letters are A F O R E, which matches:
- A(✓) F(✓) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

Let me check if this violates any previous feedback:
- From arose: O is in position 3 (✓), which matches
- From adore: O is in position 3 (✓), which matches
- From afroe: O is in the word but not in position 4 (✓), which matches
- From afire: O is not tested in position 3, so no conflict

Thus the word must be AFORE.

But why didn't AFORE come up in our earlier check? Because when we listed possible words after afire, we overlooked AFORE - the only valid word matching A F _ R E is AFORE, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the correct next guess is AFORE.

But wait, in afire feedback, I got x, so position 3 cannot be I, but O is allowed as long as it's not in position 4. Thus AFORE is valid.

Thus, the next guess is AFORE.

But we already have AFORE as a possible word, and it fits all constraints. Since this is the only remaining possibility, we must guess AFORE.

However, in our previous step after afire, we didn't consider AFORE because we were focused on position 3 with I ruled out. But the structure is A F _ R E, and the only valid word is AFORE with O in position 3, which is allowed.

Thus, the correct next guess is AFORE.

  - AF C R E → AFCRE (not valid)
  - AF G R E → AFGRE (not valid)
  - AF H R E → AFHRE (not valid)
  - AF L R E → AFLRE (not valid)
  - AF M R E → AFMRE (not valid)
  - AF N R E → AFNRE (not valid)
  - AF P R E → AF PRE (not valid)
  - AF T R E → AFTRE (not valid)
  - AF U R E → AFURE (not valid)
  - AF V R E → AFVRE (not valid)
  - AF W R E → AFWRE (not valid)
  - AF Y R E → AFYRE (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid words. This suggests we might have made an error in interpretation. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From afire: A(✓) F(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(✓)
- This means:
  - A is correct in position 1
  - F is correct in position 2
  - I is not in the word (x)
  - R is correct in position 4
  - E is correct in position 5

Thus the word structure is A F _ R E with position 3 being the only unknown, and I is ruled out for position 3.

Looking up 5-letter words starting with AF and ending with RE:
- AFIRE (but I is ruled out)
- AFORE (but O is ruled out)
- AFIRE and AFORE are the only two, both ruled out by current feedback

This implies there might be no valid word left, but since the game guarantees a valid word exists, I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the feedback for any possible misinterpretation.

Wait, looking back at afroe feedback: A(✓) F(✓) R(-) O(-) E(✓)
- This means O is in the word but not in position 4 (which aligns with O being in position 3)

From afire: I is not in the word, so position 3 cannot be I (already knew)
From arose: S is not in the word
From adore: D is not in the word

Thus position 3 must be a letter not yet used in any position and not ruled out. The only remaining common letter is B, giving AFBRE (invalid), or C, etc.

But none of these are valid. This suggests the word must be AFORE, but O is ruled out for position 3 from afroe feedback? Wait no: afroe feedback says O is in the word but not in position 4, so O can be in position 3. But AFORE has O in position 3, but in afroe O was in position 4 and got (-), so O cannot be in position 4 but can be in position 3. Thus AFORE is possible.

But in AFORE, position 3 is O, which was in position 4 in afroe and got (-), so O cannot be in position 4 but can be in position 3. Thus AFORE is possible.

But in AFORE, the letters are A F O R E, which matches:
- A(✓) F(✓) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

Let me check if this violates any previous feedback:
- From arose: O is in position 3 (✓), which matches
- From adore: O is in position 3 (✓), which matches
- From afroe: O is in the word but not in position 4 (✓), which matches
- From afire: O is not tested in position 3, so no conflict

Thus the word must be AFORE.

But why didn't AFORE come up in our earlier check? Because when we listed possible words after afire, we overlooked AFORE - the only valid word matching A F _ R E is AFORE, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the correct next guess is AFORE.

But wait, in afire feedback, I got x, so position 3 cannot be I, but O is allowed as long as it's not in position 4. Thus AFORE is valid.

Thus, the next guess is AFORE.

But we already have AFORE as a possible word, and it fits all constraints. Since this is the only remaining possibility, we must guess AFORE.

However, in our previous step after afire, we didn't consider AFORE because we were focused on position 3 with I ruled out. But the structure is A F _ R E, and the only valid word is AFORE with O in position 3, which is allowed.

Thus, the correct next guess is AFORE.After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only remaining valid word that fits the constraints is:",Guess 5: afore -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) F(✓) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
