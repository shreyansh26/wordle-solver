For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and has no repeating letters, which maximizes the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): S, A
- S cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 3.

We still need to test other common letters. Good next candidates are R, I, N, O, C, U, D, etc. Since we have S and A confirmed, let's try to place them in new positions and introduce new common letters.

A word that uses S and A in new positions and introduces R, I, N is ""SARIN"". However, this might be too speculative. Instead, let's use ""RAINS"" - it has A and S, places them in new spots, and introduces R, I, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and has no repeating letters, which maximizes the information gained from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): S, A
- S cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 3.

We still need to test other common letters. Good next candidates are R, I, N, O, C, U, D, etc. Since we have S and A confirmed, let's try to place them in new positions and introduce new common letters.

A word that uses S and A in new positions and introduces R, I, N is ""SARIN"". However, this might be too speculative. Instead, let's use ""RAINS"" - it has A and S, places them in new spots, and introduces R, I, N.

From the new feedback on RAINS:
- R is in the correct position (position 1).
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- I is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- S is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we have:
- Pattern: R A _ _ S
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, A, S
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that haven't been eliminated. Common remaining letters include D, O, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's think of 5-letter words that fit R A _ _ S:
- RADIO (but I and D are both unused; D is okay)
- RAPID (but P and D are okay, but I is already out)
- RAVES (but V and E are okay, but E is out)
- RAINS (already tried)
- RAZES (but Z and E are okay, but E is out)
- RAVES (E is out)
- RACOS (but C and O are okay)
- RAGUS (but G and U are okay)

Looking at these, ""RACOS"" seems plausible - uses C and O which haven't been tested yet, and fits the pattern.

But let's double-check:
- R A C O S
- C and O haven't been eliminated
- No conflicts with previous feedback

Another option is ""RADIO"" - uses D and O. Both seem valid. Between these, ""RADIO"" is a more common word, so I'll go with that.

The next best, fully common word is “RAGGS” (short for ragged or rags), but G is repeated and might be less likely.

Looking again, the only fully common word left is “RACYS” (a surname) – still not ideal.

However, “RACUS” is listed as a valid 5-letter English word (though rare), and uses still-allowed letters C and U.

Therefore, I’ll guess RACUS to test C and U in the final positions.

- S is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we have:
- Pattern: R A _ _ S
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, A, S
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that haven't been eliminated. Common remaining letters include D, O, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's think of 5-letter words that fit R A _ _ S:
- RADIO (but I and D are both unused; D is okay)
- RAPID (but P and D are okay, but I is already out)
- RAVES (but V and E are okay, but E is out)
- RAINS (already tried)
- RAZES (but Z and E are okay, but E is out)
- RAVES (E is out)
- RACOS (but C and O are okay)
- RAGUS (but G and U are okay)

Looking at these, ""RACOS"" seems plausible - uses C and O which haven't been tested yet, and fits the pattern.

But let's double-check:
- R A C O S
- C and O haven't been eliminated
- No conflicts with previous feedback

Another option is ""RADIO"" - uses D and O. Both seem valid. Between these, ""RADIO"" is a more common word, so I'll go with that.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   ⇒ A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ L, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. RAINS → R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)  
   ⇒ R is correct in position 1.  
   ⇒ A is correct in position 2.  
   ⇒ I and N are NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ S is correct in position 5.

3. RADIO → R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(x)  
   ⇒ D, I, O are NOT in the word.

Current known pattern:  
R A _ _ S

Confirmed letters in the word: R, A, S  
Confirmed letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N, D, O

Remaining common letters to test in positions 3 and 4: C, U, G, M, P, Y, F, H, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting R A _ _ S with no excluded letters:
- RACUS (RACUS is a genus of plants/animals, but uncommon)
- RAGUS (RAGUS is a place name, also uncommon)
- RAMPS (M and P are still allowed)
- RAPUS (RUPA is a plant genus, but ""RAPUS"" isn't standard)
- RAYUS (not a standard word)
- RACMS (not a word)
- RACGS (not a word)

The only reasonable common word left seems to be ""RAMPS"", which uses M and P—both still allowed.

Let's verify:
- R A M P S
- M and P haven't been eliminated
- No conflicts with previous feedback

<|im_end|>

From the latest feedback on RAMPS:
- R(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x) S(✓)  
  ⇒ positions 1, 2, 5 are locked: R A _ _ S  
  ⇒ positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters that have NOT yet been ruled out.

Summary of all letters ruled out so far:
NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N, D, O, M, P

Letters still allowed (and common) for positions 3 & 4:
C, U, G, Y, F, H, K, B, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form R A _ _ S using only still-allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Scanning the dictionary for R A _ _ S with no excluded letters:
- RACUS (valid but uncommon)
- RAGUS (proper noun)
- RAYUS (not standard)
- RAVES (E is out)
- RAGGS (G twice, but G allowed)
- RACKS (K allowed)
- RACYS (Y allowed)
- RAGYS (Y allowed)

The most common and valid remaining candidate is “RACUS” (the genus of plants/animals), but it’s still obscure.  
A more universally recognized word that fits is “RAGUS” (a town in Greece), but it’s also a proper noun.

The next best, fully common word is “RAGGS” (short for ragged or rags), but G is repeated and might be less likely.

Looking again, the only fully common word left is “RACYS” (a surname) – still not ideal.

However, “RACUS” is listed as a valid 5-letter English word (though rare), and uses still-allowed letters C and U.

Therefore, I’ll guess RACUS to test C and U in the final positions.

(If RACUS fails, the only remaining common word would be RAGUS, but since we need a guess, RACUS is the logical choice.)
