1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It has good letter distribution across positions
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Has 5 letters, with 3 unknown letters so far.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and R in new positions.

So the pattern so far is:

Common unused letters: L, C, D, G, B, M, P, U, Y, H, F, K, etc.

1. Starts with T (fixed)
2. Places A and R in positions we haven’t tested yet (positions 4 and 5 are still open for both, but we also want to test positions 2 and 3)
3. Uses two new common consonants.

From the latest feedback (TARDY):

- T(✓) – T is correct and in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct and in position 2.
- R(✓) – R is correct and in position 3.
- D(x) – D is not in the word at all.
- Y(✓) – Y is correct and in position 5.

So the word so far is: T A R _ Y

We still need a single letter for position 4.  
We know the word must be 5 letters and all letters must be from the remaining unused pool (excluding O,S,E,I,N,D).

Common unused letters: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K, etc.

Let’s pick the most common consonant that fits: L.

The word would be T A R L Y → “TARLY” – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Next common consonant: C → T A R C Y – not valid.

Next: B → T A R B Y – not valid.

Next: G → T A R G Y – not valid.

Next: M → T A R M Y – not valid.

Next: K → T A R K Y – not valid.

Let’s try a vowel for position 4. We have used A, so other vowels: U.

T A R U Y – still not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: valid 5-letter words that start with T A R and end with Y.

Common ones: TARRY (but repeats R, which is already in position 3).

TARLY – invalid  
TARCY – invalid  
TARBY – invalid  
TARHY – invalid  
TARPY – invalid  
TARKY – invalid  

The only valid word is TARRY, but it repeats R. However, the feedback already confirmed R is in position 3, so it can’t appear again.

Wait, let’s check the dictionary again. Are there other words?

Actually, TARRY is the only common word that fits T A R _ Y. But since R is already in position 3, the fourth letter can’t be R. So we need another letter.

Looking at the letters we have not used yet and are valid: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

The only valid word seems to be TARRY, but since R is already used once in position 3, it can’t be in position 4. Therefore, we need to find another letter.

Let me think of other valid words: TAPIR – but ends with R.

TAROK – ends with K, but doesn’t end with Y.

TARUT – but ends with T.

Actually, the only valid word ending with Y is TARRY, but it repeats R. Since R is confirmed in position 3, the fourth letter must be a different letter.

Looking at the remaining letters, let me try L: T A R L Y – but that isn’t a word.

Wait, let me check the dictionary again. Are there other words?

Actually, T A R _ Y with valid letters:

- T A R B Y – invalid
- T A R C Y – invalid
- T A R D Y – D is excluded
- T A R F Y – invalid

- T A R P Y – invalid
- T A R U Y – invalid
- T A R V Y – invalid
- T A R W Y – invalid
- T A R X Y – invalid
- T A R Z Y – invalid

It appears the only valid word is TARRY, but since R is already in position 3, position 4 must be a different letter. This suggests the word might be TARRY, but the feedback would have indicated R in position 3 and Y in position 5, which matches. However, the fourth letter would have to be R, which is already in position 3. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From TARDY:
- T(✓) – position 1
- A(✓) – position 2
- R(✓) – position 3
- D(x) – not in word
- Y(✓) – position 5

So the word is T A R _ Y, and the fourth letter must be a letter not yet used and not excluded. From the letters we have not used and not excluded: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

Looking for valid English words: T A R _ Y.

The only valid word is TARRY, but it repeats R. However, the feedback for R in position 3 was ✓, so R is confirmed in position 3. The fourth letter could still be R if the word is TARRY, but that would have R in position 3 and 4, which is possible.

Let me check if TARRY is a valid word – yes, it is.

But since R is already confirmed in position 3, the fourth letter could indeed be R, making the word TARRY.

However, the feedback for D was x, so D is not in the word, but that doesn't prevent R from appearing again.

Thus, the word must be TARRY.

But wait, let me confirm: T A R R Y.

Positions:
1: T ✓
2: A ✓
3: R ✓
4: R – but R is already in position 3, so this would have been indicated differently. The feedback for R in position 3 was ✓, meaning it's correct there, but doesn't prevent another R later.

Thus, TARRY is a valid possibility.

But is there another word? Let me think of others:

T A R _ Y with valid letters:

- T A R B Y – invalid
- T A R C Y – invalid
- T A R F Y – invalid
- T A R G Y – invalid
- T A R K Y – invalid
- T A R L Y – invalid
- T A R M Y – invalid
- T A R P Y – invalid
- T A R U Y – invalid
- T A R V Y – invalid
- T A R W Y – invalid
- T A R X Y – invalid
- T A R Z Y – invalid

Only TARRY seems valid.

Therefore, the word must be TARRY.

But since we have to make a guess, and TARRY is the only valid word fitting the pattern, we should guess it.

However, let me check if there are other possible letters I missed. The letters not used yet and not excluded: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

None of these form a valid word with T A R _ Y.

Thus, the only possible word is TARRY.

But to be thorough, let me check another angle: maybe the word is T A R _ Y with a different letter.

Actually, the word could be T A R K Y – but that's not a word.

T A R B Y – invalid.

T A R C Y – invalid.

T A R F Y – invalid.

T A R G Y – invalid.

T A R L Y – invalid.

T A R M Y – invalid.

T A R P Y – invalid.

T A R U Y – invalid.

T A R V Y – invalid.

T A R W Y – invalid.

T A R X Y – invalid.

T A R Z Y – invalid.

Thus, the only valid word is TARRY.

Therefore, the next guess must be TARRY.

But since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th, we can proceed.

However, let me think if there's another possibility. The word could be T A R _ Y with a letter not yet considered.

Wait, the word could be T A R _ Y with a letter like 'L' making TARLY, but that's not a word.

Thus, the only valid word is TARRY.

Therefore, the guess is TARRY.

But to confirm, let me check the dictionary: yes, TARRY is a valid 5-letter word meaning to stick or adhere.

Thus, the word must be TARRY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It has good letter distribution across positions
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Has 5 letters, with 3 unknown letters so far.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and R in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, C).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T (new letter)
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This tests 3 new letters (T, I, N) while repositioning A and R.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, T  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 3  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 2 (still not position 2)  
- T is in the word AND in position 1  

So the pattern so far is:
T _ _ _ _

and we still need to place A and R somewhere in positions 2-5, and we need two more letters (not O,S,E,I,N).

Common unused letters: L, C, D, G, B, M, P, U, Y, H, F, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Starts with T (fixed)
2. Places A and R in positions we haven’t tested yet (positions 4 and 5 are still open for both, but we also want to test positions 2 and 3)
3. Uses two new common consonants.

A good candidate is “TARDY”:
- T (✓ position 1)
- A (new position 2)
- R (new position 3)
- D (new letter)
- Y (new letter)

This tests A in position 2 and R in position 3, plus two new letters D and Y.

Common unused letters: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K, etc.

The only valid word is TARRY, but it repeats R. However, the feedback already confirmed R is in position 3, so it can’t appear again.

Wait, let’s check the dictionary again. Are there other words?

Actually, TARRY is the only common word that fits T A R _ Y. But since R is already in position 3, the fourth letter can’t be R. So we need another letter.

Looking at the letters we have not used yet and are valid: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

The only valid word seems to be TARRY, but since R is already used once in position 3, it can’t be in position 4. Therefore, we need to find another letter.

Let me think of other valid words: TAPIR – but ends with R.

TAROK – ends with K, but doesn’t end with Y.

TARUT – but ends with T.

Actually, the only valid word ending with Y is TARRY, but it repeats R. Since R is confirmed in position 3, the fourth letter must be a different letter.

Looking at the remaining letters, let me try L: T A R L Y – but that isn’t a word.

Wait, let me check the dictionary again. Are there other words?

Actually, T A R _ Y with valid letters:

- T A R B Y – invalid

It appears the only valid word is TARRY, but since R is already in position 3, position 4 must be a different letter. This suggests the word might be TARRY, but the feedback would have indicated R in position 3 and Y in position 5, which matches. However, the fourth letter would have to be R, which is already in position 3. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From TARDY:
- T(✓) – position 1
- A(✓) – position 2
- R(✓) – position 3
- D(x) – not in word
- Y(✓) – position 5

So the word is T A R _ Y, and the fourth letter must be a letter not yet used and not excluded. From the letters we have not used and not excluded: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

Looking for valid English words: T A R _ Y.

The only valid word is TARRY, but it repeats R. However, the feedback for R in position 3 was ✓, so R is confirmed in position 3. The fourth letter could still be R if the word is TARRY, but that would have R in position 3 and 4, which is possible.

Let me check if TARRY is a valid word – yes, it is.

But since R is already confirmed in position 3, the fourth letter could indeed be R, making the word TARRY.

However, the feedback for D was x, so D is not in the word, but that doesn't prevent R from appearing again.

Thus, the word must be TARRY.

But wait, let me confirm: T A R R Y.

4: R – but R is already in position 3, so this would have been indicated differently. The feedback for R in position 3 was ✓, meaning it's correct there, but doesn't prevent another R later.

Thus, TARRY is a valid possibility.

But is there another word? Let me think of others:

T A R _ Y with valid letters:

- T A R B Y – invalid
- T A R C Y – invalid
- T A R F Y – invalid
- T A R G Y – invalid
- T A R K Y – invalid
- T A R L Y – invalid
- T A R M Y – invalid
- T A R P Y – invalid
- T A R U Y – invalid
- T A R V Y – invalid
- T A R W Y – invalid
- T A R X Y – invalid
- T A R Z Y – invalid

Only TARRY seems valid.

Therefore, the word must be TARRY.

But since we have to make a guess, and TARRY is the only valid word fitting the pattern, we should guess it.

However, let me check if there are other possible letters I missed. The letters not used yet and not excluded: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

None of these form a valid word with T A R _ Y.

Thus, the only possible word is TARRY.

But to be thorough, let me check another angle: maybe the word is T A R _ Y with a different letter.

Actually, the word could be T A R K Y – but that's not a word.

T A R B Y – invalid.

T A R C Y – invalid.

T A R F Y – invalid.

T A R G Y – invalid.

T A R L Y – invalid.

T A R M Y – invalid.

T A R P Y – invalid.

T A R U Y – invalid.

T A R V Y – invalid.

T A R W Y – invalid.

T A R X Y – invalid.

T A R Z Y – invalid.

Thus, the only valid word is TARRY.

Therefore, the next guess must be TARRY.

But since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th, we can proceed.

However, let me think if there's another possibility. The word could be T A R _ Y with a letter not yet considered.

Wait, the word could be T A R _ Y with a letter like 'L' making TARLY, but that's not a word.

Thus, the only valid word is TARRY.

Therefore, the guess is TARRY.

But to confirm, let me check the dictionary: yes, TARRY is a valid 5-letter word meaning to stick or adhere.

Thus, the word must be TARRY.

<guess>TARRY</guess>Based on the feedback, the word must be T A R _ Y. The only valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern is TARRY.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It has good letter distribution across positions
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Has 5 letters, with 3 unknown letters so far.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and R in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, C).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T (new letter)
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This tests 3 new letters (T, I, N) while repositioning A and R.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, T  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 3  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 2 (still not position 2)  
- T is in the word AND in position 1  

So the pattern so far is:
T _ _ _ _

and we still need to place A and R somewhere in positions 2-5, and we need two more letters (not O,S,E,I,N).

Common unused letters: L, C, D, G, B, M, P, U, Y, H, F, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Starts with T (fixed)
2. Places A and R in positions we haven’t tested yet (positions 4 and 5 are still open for both, but we also want to test positions 2 and 3)
3. Uses two new common consonants.

A good candidate is “TARDY”:
- T (✓ position 1)
- A (new position 2)
- R (new position 3)
- D (new letter)
- Y (new letter)

This tests A in position 2 and R in position 3, plus two new letters D and Y.

From the latest feedback (TARDY):

- T(✓) – T is correct and in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct and in position 2.
- R(✓) – R is correct and in position 3.
- D(x) – D is not in the word at all.
- Y(✓) – Y is correct and in position 5.

So the word so far is: T A R _ Y

We still need a single letter for position 4.  
We know the word must be 5 letters and all letters must be from the remaining unused pool (excluding O,S,E,I,N,D).

Common unused letters: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K, etc.

Let’s pick the most common consonant that fits: L.

The word would be T A R L Y → “TARLY” – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Next common consonant: C → T A R C Y – not valid.

Next: B → T A R B Y – not valid.

Next: G → T A R G Y – not valid.

Next: M → T A R M Y – not valid.

Next: P → T A R P Y – not valid.

Next: U → T A R U Y – not valid.

Next: H → T A R H Y – not valid.

Next: F → T A R F Y – not valid.

Next: K → T A R K Y – not valid.

Let’s try a vowel for position 4. We have used A, so other vowels: U.

T A R U Y – still not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: valid 5-letter words that start with T A R and end with Y.

Common ones: TARRY (but repeats R, which is already in position 3).

TARLY – invalid  
TARCY – invalid  
TARBY – invalid  
TARHY – invalid  
TARPY – invalid  
TARKY – invalid  

The only valid word is TARRY, but it repeats R. However, the feedback already confirmed R is in position 3, so it can’t appear again.

Wait, let’s check the dictionary again. Are there other words?

Actually, TARRY is the only common word that fits T A R _ Y. But since R is already in position 3, the fourth letter can’t be R. So we need another letter.

Looking at the letters we have not used yet and are valid: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

The only valid word seems to be TARRY, but since R is already used once in position 3, it can’t be in position 4. Therefore, we need to find another letter.

Let me think of other valid words: TAPIR – but ends with R.

TAROK – ends with K, but doesn’t end with Y.

TARUT – but ends with T.

Actually, the only valid word ending with Y is TARRY, but it repeats R. Since R is confirmed in position 3, the fourth letter must be a different letter.

Looking at the remaining letters, let me try L: T A R L Y – but that isn’t a word.

Wait, let me check the dictionary again. Are there other words?

Actually, T A R _ Y with valid letters:

- T A R B Y – invalid
- T A R C Y – invalid
- T A R D Y – D is excluded
- T A R F Y – invalid
- T A R G Y – invalid
- T A R K Y – invalid
- T A R L Y – invalid
- T A R M Y – invalid
- T A R P Y – invalid
- T A R U Y – invalid
- T A R V Y – invalid
- T A R W Y – invalid
- T A R X Y – invalid
- T A R Z Y – invalid

It appears the only valid word is TARRY, but since R is already in position 3, position 4 must be a different letter. This suggests the word might be TARRY, but the feedback would have indicated R in position 3 and Y in position 5, which matches. However, the fourth letter would have to be R, which is already in position 3. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From TARDY:
- T(✓) – position 1
- A(✓) – position 2
- R(✓) – position 3
- D(x) – not in word
- Y(✓) – position 5

So the word is T A R _ Y, and the fourth letter must be a letter not yet used and not excluded. From the letters we have not used and not excluded: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

Looking for valid English words: T A R _ Y.

The only valid word is TARRY, but it repeats R. However, the feedback for R in position 3 was ✓, so R is confirmed in position 3. The fourth letter could still be R if the word is TARRY, but that would have R in position 3 and 4, which is possible.

Let me check if TARRY is a valid word – yes, it is.

But since R is already confirmed in position 3, the fourth letter could indeed be R, making the word TARRY.

However, the feedback for D was x, so D is not in the word, but that doesn't prevent R from appearing again.

Thus, the word must be TARRY.

But wait, let me confirm: T A R R Y.

Positions:
1: T ✓
2: A ✓
3: R ✓
4: R – but R is already in position 3, so this would have been indicated differently. The feedback for R in position 3 was ✓, meaning it's correct there, but doesn't prevent another R later.

Thus, TARRY is a valid possibility.

But is there another word? Let me think of others:

T A R _ Y with valid letters:

- T A R B Y – invalid
- T A R C Y – invalid
- T A R F Y – invalid
- T A R G Y – invalid
- T A R K Y – invalid
- T A R L Y – invalid
- T A R M Y – invalid
- T A R P Y – invalid
- T A R U Y – invalid
- T A R V Y – invalid
- T A R W Y – invalid
- T A R X Y – invalid
- T A R Z Y – invalid

Only TARRY seems valid.

Therefore, the word must be TARRY.

But since we have to make a guess, and TARRY is the only valid word fitting the pattern, we should guess it.

However, let me check if there are other possible letters I missed. The letters not used yet and not excluded: L, C, B, G, M, P, U, H, F, K.

None of these form a valid word with T A R _ Y.

Thus, the only possible word is TARRY.

But to be thorough, let me check another angle: maybe the word is T A R _ Y with a different letter.

Actually, the word could be T A R K Y – but that's not a word.

T A R B Y – invalid.

T A R C Y – invalid.

T A R F Y – invalid.

T A R G Y – invalid.

T A R L Y – invalid.

T A R M Y – invalid.

T A R P Y – invalid.

T A R U Y – invalid.

T A R V Y – invalid.

T A R W Y – invalid.

T A R X Y – invalid.

T A R Z Y – invalid.

Thus, the only valid word is TARRY.

Therefore, the next guess must be TARRY.

But since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th, we can proceed.

However, let me think if there's another possibility. The word could be T A R _ Y with a letter not yet considered.

Wait, the word could be T A R _ Y with a letter like 'L' making TARLY, but that's not a word.

Thus, the only valid word is TARRY.

Therefore, the guess is TARRY.

But to confirm, let me check the dictionary: yes, TARRY is a valid 5-letter word meaning to stick or adhere.

Thus, the word must be TARRY.

<guess>TARRY</guess>Based on the feedback, the word must be T A R _ Y. The only valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern is TARRY.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: TARDY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: TARRY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback (TARRY):
- T(✓) – position 1
- A(✓) – position 2
- R(✓) – position 3
- R(-) – there is another R in the word but NOT in position 4
- Y(✓) – position 5

So the word is T A R _ Y and must contain exactly one more R somewhere other than position 4.  
The only remaining spot for that extra R is position 5, but position 5 is already Y.  
Therefore, no valid placement exists for a second R without repeating letters already confirmed or violating the single-R requirement.

This contradiction means the only possible interpretation is that the word contains exactly one R (in position 3), and the feedback for position 4’s R was simply indicating that letter is not there.  
Hence the fixed pattern remains T A R _ Y with no second R.

Re-examining the unused letters (excluding O,S,E,I,N,D) and looking for a valid 5-letter word starting TAR_ ending Y, the only dictionary entry is TARRY, but its second R would have been marked differently if disallowed.  
Given the constraints, the intended word must be TARRY despite the apparent inconsistency, or the data implies the word is TARRY and the feedback should have been T(✓)A(✓)R(✓)R(x)Y(✓) to exclude a second R.  
Interpreting strictly, the pattern T A R _ Y with no second R yields no valid English word, so the most plausible resolution is the word is TARRY and the feedback’s “R(-)” was an oversight; proceeding with the only valid guess:
