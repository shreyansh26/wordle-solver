For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good coverage of vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar reasoning.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but each in a different position than in AROSE.

Positions affected:
- O was in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT contain A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Possible candidates:
- ""POSED"" → P, O, S, E, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). No A or R.
- ""SPOKE"" → S, P, O, K, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed - was in 3 in AROSE).
- ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed).
- ""OCEAN"" → contains A (invalid).
- ""SHEET"" → no O (invalid).
- ""SPORE"" → contains R (invalid).
- ""POSED"" seems valid: positions are S(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but S is repeated which might not be optimal.

Another good option is ""SLOPE"" but O is in position 3 which is invalid. 

""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. 

""ESSEX"" → contains S twice and no O (invalid).

""OFTEN"" → O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5). O in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (invalid - was in 5 originally). 

""OFTEN"" is close but E is in 4 which was originally 5, so it's allowed since feedback says E is in word but not in 5, so 4 is fine. 

But we need to ensure S is placed correctly - in ""OFTEN"" S is missing. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S, which we know is in the word. 

""POSED"" is better as it includes S, O, E correctly placed.

Wait, ""POSED"" has S in position 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and D. No A or R. 

Another option: ""SPOKE"" but O is in 3 (invalid). 

""SOBER"" → S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - contains R (invalid).

""SOOTY"" → contains O twice but no E (invalid).

""OPIUM"" → contains O in 1 (allowed), but no S or E (invalid).

""OCEAN"" → invalid (A).

""ELBOW"" → no S (invalid).

""POSED"" seems to be the best so far. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""SOOTY"" lacks E.

""OPIED"" → O(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Contains O, E, no S - invalid (S must be present).

""SOILED"" → too long.

""SOOTY"" - no E.

""OFTEN"" - no S.

""POSED"" is the only valid 5-letter word I can find that contains O, S, E without A or R, and with positions adjusted. 

But let me think of another: ""SPOKE"" is invalid (O in 3). 

""SEWED"" → S(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Contains E twice but no O (invalid).

""SEWED"" lacks O.

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""POSED"" seems to be the only valid option here. 

However, ""POSED"" has S in position 3, which was originally position 4 in AROSE, so it's allowed. 

But ""POSED"" has S in position 1 and 3 - that's acceptable since we don't know if S appears once or twice. 

But to maximize information, it's better to have S appear once. 

Alternative: ""POSED"" is actually P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but this is ""POSED"", not ""SPOKE"".

Yes, ""POSED"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid.

""SLOPE"" invalid (O in 3).

""SOOTY"" invalid (no E).

""ELBOW"" invalid (no S).

""OFTEN"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" seems to be the best available. 

But let me try ""SPOKE"" again - but O is in 3 (invalid).

""SOBER"" invalid (R).

""SEWED"" invalid (no O).

""OPIED"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" is the only valid word I can find. 

However, ""POSED"" has P, O, S, E, D - no A or R, and positions:
- O in 2 (was 3) - allowed.
- S in 3 (was 4) - allowed.
- E in 4 (was 5) - allowed.

This seems correct.

Based on the feedback that O, S, and E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively, I'll try a word that rearranges these letters while avoiding A and R.

- SONES – plural of “son” – valid. S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). But S appears twice; we don’t know if S appears once or twice. Still, it’s a valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good coverage of vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar reasoning.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but each in a different position than in AROSE.

Positions affected:
- O was in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT contain A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Possible candidates:
- ""POSED"" → P, O, S, E, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). No A or R.
- ""SPOKE"" → S, P, O, K, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed - was in 3 in AROSE).
- ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed).
- ""OCEAN"" → contains A (invalid).
- ""SHEET"" → no O (invalid).
- ""SPORE"" → contains R (invalid).
- ""POSED"" seems valid: positions are S(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but S is repeated which might not be optimal.

Another good option is ""SLOPE"" but O is in position 3 which is invalid. 

""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. 

""ESSEX"" → contains S twice and no O (invalid).

""OFTEN"" → O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5). O in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (invalid - was in 5 originally). 

""OFTEN"" is close but E is in 4 which was originally 5, so it's allowed since feedback says E is in word but not in 5, so 4 is fine. 

But we need to ensure S is placed correctly - in ""OFTEN"" S is missing. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S, which we know is in the word. 

""POSED"" is better as it includes S, O, E correctly placed.

Wait, ""POSED"" has S in position 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and D. No A or R. 

Another option: ""SPOKE"" but O is in 3 (invalid). 

""SOBER"" → S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - contains R (invalid).

""SOOTY"" → contains O twice but no E (invalid).

""OPIUM"" → contains O in 1 (allowed), but no S or E (invalid).

""OCEAN"" → invalid (A).

""ELBOW"" → no S (invalid).

""POSED"" seems to be the best so far. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""SOOTY"" lacks E.

""OPIED"" → O(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Contains O, E, no S - invalid (S must be present).

""SOILED"" → too long.

""SOOTY"" - no E.

""OFTEN"" - no S.

""POSED"" is the only valid 5-letter word I can find that contains O, S, E without A or R, and with positions adjusted. 

But let me think of another: ""SPOKE"" is invalid (O in 3). 

""SEWED"" → S(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Contains E twice but no O (invalid).

""SEWED"" lacks O.

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""POSED"" seems to be the only valid option here. 

However, ""POSED"" has S in position 3, which was originally position 4 in AROSE, so it's allowed. 

But ""POSED"" has S in position 1 and 3 - that's acceptable since we don't know if S appears once or twice. 

But to maximize information, it's better to have S appear once. 

Alternative: ""POSED"" is actually P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but this is ""POSED"", not ""SPOKE"".

Yes, ""POSED"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid.

""SLOPE"" invalid (O in 3).

""SOOTY"" invalid (no E).

""ELBOW"" invalid (no S).

""OFTEN"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" seems to be the best available. 

But let me try ""SPOKE"" again - but O is in 3 (invalid).

""SOBER"" invalid (R).

""SEWED"" invalid (no O).

""OPIED"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" is the only valid word I can find. 

However, ""POSED"" has P, O, S, E, D - no A or R, and positions:
- O in 2 (was 3) - allowed.
- S in 3 (was 4) - allowed.
- E in 4 (was 5) - allowed.

This seems correct.Based on the feedback that O, S, and E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively, I'll try a word that rearranges these letters while avoiding A and R.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good coverage of vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar reasoning.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but each in a different position than in AROSE.

Positions affected:
- O was in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT contain A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Possible candidates:
- ""POSED"" → P, O, S, E, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). No A or R.
- ""SPOKE"" → S, P, O, K, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed - was in 3 in AROSE).
- ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed).
- ""OCEAN"" → contains A (invalid).
- ""SHEET"" → no O (invalid).
- ""SPORE"" → contains R (invalid).
- ""POSED"" seems valid: positions are S(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but S is repeated which might not be optimal.

Another good option is ""SLOPE"" but O is in position 3 which is invalid. 

""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. 

""ESSEX"" → contains S twice and no O (invalid).

""OFTEN"" → O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5). O in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (invalid - was in 5 originally). 

""OFTEN"" is close but E is in 4 which was originally 5, so it's allowed since feedback says E is in word but not in 5, so 4 is fine. 

But we need to ensure S is placed correctly - in ""OFTEN"" S is missing. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S, which we know is in the word. 

""POSED"" is better as it includes S, O, E correctly placed.

Wait, ""POSED"" has S in position 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and D. No A or R. 

Another option: ""SPOKE"" but O is in 3 (invalid). 

""SOBER"" → S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - contains R (invalid).

""SOOTY"" → contains O twice but no E (invalid).

""OPIUM"" → contains O in 1 (allowed), but no S or E (invalid).

""OCEAN"" → invalid (A).

""ELBOW"" → no S (invalid).

""POSED"" seems to be the best so far. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""SOOTY"" lacks E.

""OPIED"" → O(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Contains O, E, no S - invalid (S must be present).

""SOILED"" → too long.

""SOOTY"" - no E.

""OFTEN"" - no S.

""POSED"" is the only valid 5-letter word I can find that contains O, S, E without A or R, and with positions adjusted. 

But let me think of another: ""SPOKE"" is invalid (O in 3). 

""SEWED"" → S(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Contains E twice but no O (invalid).

""SEWED"" lacks O.

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""POSED"" seems to be the only valid option here. 

However, ""POSED"" has S in position 3, which was originally position 4 in AROSE, so it's allowed. 

But ""POSED"" has S in position 1 and 3 - that's acceptable since we don't know if S appears once or twice. 

But to maximize information, it's better to have S appear once. 

Alternative: ""POSED"" is actually P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but this is ""POSED"", not ""SPOKE"".

Yes, ""POSED"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid.

""SLOPE"" invalid (O in 3).

""SOOTY"" invalid (no E).

""ELBOW"" invalid (no S).

""OFTEN"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" seems to be the best available. 

But let me try ""SPOKE"" again - but O is in 3 (invalid).

""SOBER"" invalid (R).

""SEWED"" invalid (no O).

""OPIED"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" is the only valid word I can find. 

However, ""POSED"" has P, O, S, E, D - no A or R, and positions:
- O in 2 (was 3) - allowed.
- S in 3 (was 4) - allowed.
- E in 4 (was 5) - allowed.

This seems correct.Based on the feedback that O, S, and E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively, I'll try a word that rearranges these letters while avoiding A and R.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - P and D are not in the word.
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is now in the correct position (position 4).
   - S is still in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ O _ E _
- Letters present: O, S, E (and no A, R, P, D).
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 3 or 4 already). But position 4 is E, so S must be in 1 or 5.
- We still need one more letter (since we’ve placed O, S, E).

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _
- _ O _ E S

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D). Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

For S O _ E _:
- SOBES – but B is allowed, but “SOBES” isn’t a common word.
- SOLER – contains R (invalid).
- SONAR – contains A and R (invalid).
- SOWER – contains W, but “SOWER” is valid. Let’s check: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) – but R is invalid (from AROSE). So “SOWER” is out.
- SONGE – but G is allowed, “SONGE” isn’t a common word.
- SONES – plural of “son” – valid. S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). But S appears twice; we don’t know if S appears once or twice. Still, it’s a valid word.

For _ O _ E S:
- HOMES – but H is allowed, M is allowed. Pattern: H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). This fits all constraints:
   - H, O, M, E, S – no A, R, P, D.
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (new position, allowed since it can’t be in 3 or 4).
   - H and M are new letters, but that’s fine since we’re testing them.

“HOMES” seems like the most straightforward valid word fitting all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - good coverage of vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar reasoning.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but each in a different position than in AROSE.

Positions affected:
- O was in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT contain A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in positions different from 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Possible candidates:
- ""POSED"" → P, O, S, E, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). No A or R.
- ""SPOKE"" → S, P, O, K, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed - was in 3 in AROSE).
- ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E. S in 1 (allowed), O in 3 (not allowed).
- ""OCEAN"" → contains A (invalid).
- ""SHEET"" → no O (invalid).
- ""SPORE"" → contains R (invalid).
- ""POSED"" seems valid: positions are S(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but S is repeated which might not be optimal.

Another good option is ""SLOPE"" but O is in position 3 which is invalid. 

""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. 

""ESSEX"" → contains S twice and no O (invalid).

""OFTEN"" → O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5). O in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (invalid - was in 5 originally). 

""OFTEN"" is close but E is in 4 which was originally 5, so it's allowed since feedback says E is in word but not in 5, so 4 is fine. 

But we need to ensure S is placed correctly - in ""OFTEN"" S is missing. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S, which we know is in the word. 

""POSED"" is better as it includes S, O, E correctly placed.

Wait, ""POSED"" has S in position 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and D. No A or R. 

Another option: ""SPOKE"" but O is in 3 (invalid). 

""SOBER"" → S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - contains R (invalid).

""SOOTY"" → contains O twice but no E (invalid).

""OPIUM"" → contains O in 1 (allowed), but no S or E (invalid).

""OCEAN"" → invalid (A).

""ELBOW"" → no S (invalid).

""POSED"" seems to be the best so far. 

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""SOOTY"" lacks E.

""OPIED"" → O(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Contains O, E, no S - invalid (S must be present).

""SOILED"" → too long.

""SOOTY"" - no E.

""OFTEN"" - no S.

""POSED"" is the only valid 5-letter word I can find that contains O, S, E without A or R, and with positions adjusted. 

But let me think of another: ""SPOKE"" is invalid (O in 3). 

""SEWED"" → S(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Contains E twice but no O (invalid).

""SEWED"" lacks O.

""OFTEN"" lacks S.

""POSED"" seems to be the only valid option here. 

However, ""POSED"" has S in position 3, which was originally position 4 in AROSE, so it's allowed. 

But ""POSED"" has S in position 1 and 3 - that's acceptable since we don't know if S appears once or twice. 

But to maximize information, it's better to have S appear once. 

Alternative: ""POSED"" is actually P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5) - but this is ""POSED"", not ""SPOKE"".

Yes, ""POSED"" seems valid. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid.

""SLOPE"" invalid (O in 3).

""SOOTY"" invalid (no E).

""ELBOW"" invalid (no S).

""OFTEN"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" seems to be the best available. 

But let me try ""SPOKE"" again - but O is in 3 (invalid).

""SOBER"" invalid (R).

""SEWED"" invalid (no O).

""OPIED"" invalid (no S).

""POSED"" is the only valid word I can find. 

However, ""POSED"" has P, O, S, E, D - no A or R, and positions:
- O in 2 (was 3) - allowed.
- S in 3 (was 4) - allowed.
- E in 4 (was 5) - allowed.

This seems correct.Based on the feedback that O, S, and E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively, I'll try a word that rearranges these letters while avoiding A and R.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - P and D are not in the word.
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is now in the correct position (position 4).
   - S is still in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ O _ E _
- Letters present: O, S, E (and no A, R, P, D).
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 3 or 4 already). But position 4 is E, so S must be in 1 or 5.
- We still need one more letter (since we’ve placed O, S, E).

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _
- _ O _ E S

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D). Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

For S O _ E _:
- SOBES – but B is allowed, but “SOBES” isn’t a common word.
- SOLER – contains R (invalid).
- SONAR – contains A and R (invalid).
- SOWER – contains W, but “SOWER” is valid. Let’s check: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) – but R is invalid (from AROSE). So “SOWER” is out.
- SONGE – but G is allowed, “SONGE” isn’t a common word.
- SONES – plural of “son” – valid. S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). But S appears twice; we don’t know if S appears once or twice. Still, it’s a valid word.

For _ O _ E S:
- HOMES – but H is allowed, M is allowed. Pattern: H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). This fits all constraints:
   - H, O, M, E, S – no A, R, P, D.
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (new position, allowed since it can’t be in 3 or 4).
   - H and M are new letters, but that’s fine since we’re testing them.

“HOMES” seems like the most straightforward valid word fitting all constraints.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R
   - Letters IN the word (wrong positions): O, S, E

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Additional letters NOT in the word: P, D
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2)
   - E is now in the correct position (position 4)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 3

3. HOMES → H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - Additional letters NOT in the word: H, M
   - O and E confirmed in positions 2 and 4
   - S is now in the correct position (position 5)

So the word must be of the form: _ O _ E S

We know the letters in the word are O, E, S and we have two unknown positions (1 and 3). The letters already ruled out are: A, R, P, D, H, M.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits _ O _ E S, uses only letters not yet ruled out, and contains no duplicates of the known letters (unless the letter appears twice, which we haven't evidence for).

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (excluding A, R, P, D, H, M): B, C, F, G, I, K, L, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's list some valid words fitting this pattern:
- B O G E S (B, O, G, E, S) - B and G are allowed
- B O K E S - but ""BOKES"" isn't a valid word
- C O V E S - ""COVES"" is valid
- F O G E S - ""FOGES"" isn't valid
- G O L E S - ""GOL ES"" isn't valid
- L O V E S - ""LOVES"" is valid
- N O T E S - ""NOTES"" is valid
- V O L E S - ""VOL ES"" isn't valid
- W O N E S - ""WONES"" isn't valid

From this, the valid candidates are: B O G E S, C O V E S, L O V E S, N O T E S.

Among these, ""NOTES"" is the most common and likely word.

Let's verify:
- N is allowed (not ruled out)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- T is allowed
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

This fits all constraints perfectly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: NOTES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(✓)

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ O _ E S (positions 2, 4, 5 fixed as O, E, S)
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, P, D, H, M, N, T
- Still need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not yet used.

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones and the ones already placed):
B, C, F, G, I, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ O _ E S using only these letters in positions 1 and 3.

Possible combinations:
- B O G E S → BOGES (not a valid word)
- B O K E S → BOKES (not valid)
- C O V E S → COVES (valid)
- F O G E S → FOGES (not valid)
- G O L E S → GOL ES (not valid)
- L O V E S → LOVES (valid)
- V O L E S → VOL ES (not valid)
- W O K E S → WOKES (valid, though less common)

The most common and likely valid word here is ""LOVES"".

Check:
- L is allowed (not ruled out)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- V is allowed
- E in position 4 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)

""LOVES"" fits perfectly.
