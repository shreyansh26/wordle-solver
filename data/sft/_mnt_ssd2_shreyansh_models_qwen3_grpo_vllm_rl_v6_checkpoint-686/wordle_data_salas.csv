### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This provides a good baseline to see which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓), so the word starts with S.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and L, but A is not in position 1 or 3, and L is not in position 2.
- Does not contain R, O, E, N, T.

Remaining letters to test: common ones like I, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place A and L in new positions while introducing new common consonants. The word must be S _ _ _ _.

Possible structure:
- S _ A _ _  (A in position 3 is invalid, so try position 2 or 4 or 5)
- S _ _ A _  (A in position 4)
- S _ _ _ A  (A in position 5)

Also, L must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 2).

Let’s try ""SALAD"":
- S (✓) in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new position for L).
- A in position 4 (but we already know A is in word, but this is redundant).
- D is new.

But ""SALAD"" has two A’s, which might not be efficient. Let’s try ""SALID"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- A in 2.
- L in 3.
- I is new.
- D is new.

This seems better as it introduces I and D while placing A and L in new spots.

But wait, ""SALID"" might not be a valid word. Let me think of a valid word starting with S, containing A and L, and introducing new letters.

Another option: ""SCALD"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- C is new.
- A in 3 (but A can't be in 3 from SLANT feedback: A(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: ""SPLAY"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- P is new.
- L in 3 (new for L).
- A in 4 (new for A).
- Y is new.

This seems valid and meets all constraints:

  - Position 5: No constraints yet except that it can't be any of the excluded letters.

Valid letters left to consider for position 2 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ L A _ and use remaining letters. The most common ending after ""SLA"" is ""UGHT"" but that's 6 letters. Common 5-letter words:

""SCALD"" was considered before but A was in position 4 which was already confirmed. ""SCALD"" is S C A L D but structure is S _ L A _, so S C L A D would be S C L A D - but that's not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This provides a good baseline to see which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters to include: A, S
- Positions to avoid: A in 1st, S in 4th
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, N, L, I, U).

A good next guess would place A and S in new positions while introducing new common letters. The word ""SLANT"" covers:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- L (new consonant)
- A in position 3 (new position)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)

This tests three new consonants (L, N, T) while repositioning A and S.

   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and L, but A is not in position 1 or 3, and L is not in position 2.
- Does not contain R, O, E, N, T.

Remaining letters to test: common ones like I, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place A and L in new positions while introducing new common consonants. The word must be S _ _ _ _.

Possible structure:
- S _ A _ _  (A in position 3 is invalid, so try position 2 or 4 or 5)
- S _ _ A _  (A in position 4)
- S _ _ _ A  (A in position 5)

Also, L must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 2).

Let’s try ""SALAD"":
- S (✓) in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new position for L).
- A in position 4 (but we already know A is in word, but this is redundant).
- D is new.

But ""SALAD"" has two A’s, which might not be efficient. Let’s try ""SALID"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- A in 2.
- L in 3.
- I is new.
- D is new.

This seems better as it introduces I and D while placing A and L in new spots.

But wait, ""SALID"" might not be a valid word. Let me think of a valid word starting with S, containing A and L, and introducing new letters.

Another option: ""SCALD"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- C is new.
- A in 3 (but A can't be in 3 from SLANT feedback: A(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: ""SPLAY"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- P is new.
- L in 3 (new for L).
- A in 4 (new for A).
- Y is new.

This seems valid and meets all constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A (position 4) and L (position 3).
- Introduces P and Y.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).

   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

3. SPLAY → S(✓) P(x) L(✓) A(✓) Y(x)
   - S (✓) in position 1.
   - L (✓) in position 3.
   - A (✓) in position 4.
   - P, Y are not in the word.

4. SQUAL → S(✓) Q(x) U(x) A(✓) L(-)
   - S (✓) in position 1.
   - Q is not in the word.
   - U is not in the word.
   - A (✓) in position 4.
   - L is in the word but not in position 5 (since L(-) means it's in the word but not in that position).

Current constraints:
- Word must be S _ L A _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed).
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, N, T, P, Y, Q, U.
- L must be in position 2 or 5, but from SQUAL feedback L is not in position 5, so L must be in position 2.
- Therefore the word is S L L A _ but this has two L's which seems unlikely.
Wait, no: positions are fixed as S _ L A _, and L must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 5 and already placed in 3 from SPLAY). This would make the word S L L A _, but this seems impossible as L can't be in 3 and 2 at the same time.

Re-examining:
From SPLAY: L is in position 3 (✓).
From SQUAL: L(-) in position 5 means L is in the word but not in position 5, which is already satisfied as L is in position 3.
Thus, the word structure remains S _ L A _, with L in position 3.

Now, position 2 must be a consonant not yet used and not excluded. Excluded letters so far: R, O, E, N, T, P, Y, Q, U.
Remaining possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words with structure S _ L A _:
- S C L A M
- S C L A D
- S C L A V
- S C L A K
- S C L A S (invalid, S already in 1)
- S C L A R (R excluded)

""SCALD"" is S C A L D but structure is S _ L A _, so S C L A D - this is not a valid word.
""SCALM"" is not valid.
""SCALV"" is not valid.
""SCALK"" is not valid.

Looking at remaining letters, ""D"" is common:
- S C L A D - not valid
- S C L A M - ""SCLAM"" not valid
- S C L A K - ""SCLAK"" not valid

Realizing that with S _ L A _ and L in position 3, the only valid word seems to be ""SCALA"" but that has A in position 2 and 5, but A is already in position 4. This seems impossible.

Wait, re-examining the constraints:
- Word must be S _ L A _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed).
- Position 2: must be a consonant not excluded (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W).
- Position 5: must be a consonant not excluded.

Looking at valid words:
- S C L A M - ""SCLAM"" not valid
- S C L A D - ""SCLAD"" not valid
- S C L A V - ""SCLAV"" not valid
- S C L A K - ""SCLAK"" not valid
- S C L A S - invalid

- S H L A M - ""SHLAM"" not valid
- S K L A M - ""SKLAM"" not valid
- S V L A M - ""SVLAM"" not valid
- S W L A M - ""SWLAM"" not valid

Realizing that ""SCLAM"" is not a valid English word, but ""SCALD"" is S C A L D which doesn't fit S _ L A _. This suggests that the only possible word is ""SCLAM"" which is invalid.

Re-examining the constraints more carefully:
- Word is S _ L A _.
- L is in position 3 (from SPLAY).
- From SQUAL, L(-) in position 5 means L is not in position 5, which is already satisfied.
- Position 2 must be a consonant not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W.
- Position 5 must be a consonant not excluded.

Looking at valid words:
- S C L A M - invalid
- S C L A D - invalid
- S C L A V - invalid
- S C L A K - invalid
- S C L A S - invalid
- S C L A B - invalid
- S C L A G - invalid
- S C L A H - invalid
- S C L A I - invalid (I is vowel)
- S C L A M - invalid

This seems impossible. Realizing that the only valid word fitting S _ L A _ with these constraints is ""SCALA"" but that would require A in position 5, which is possible.

""SCALA"" is S C A L A:
- S (✓) in 1
- C (new)
- A (in position 3, but from SLANT A is not in position 3) - invalid

This suggests that the word must be ""SCLAD"" but that's not valid. Realizing that the only possible word is ""SCALD"" but structure doesn't fit.

Re-examining: perhaps position 2 is a vowel? But from SLANT, A is not in position 3, and from SPLAY A is in position 4, so A could be in position 2 or 5.

Looking for words S A L A _:
- S A L A M - ""SALAM"" not valid
- S A L A D - ""SALAD"" - valid word!

""SALAD"" is S A L A D:
- S (✓) in 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- L (✓) in 3
- A (✓) in 4
- D is new

This fits all constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains L in position 3 and A in position 4.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- D is new letter.
- No excluded letters used.

Thus, the next guess should be ""SALAD"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This provides a good baseline to see which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters to include: A, S
- Positions to avoid: A in 1st, S in 4th
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, N, L, I, U).

A good next guess would place A and S in new positions while introducing new common letters. The word ""SLANT"" covers:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- L (new consonant)
- A in position 3 (new position)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)

This tests three new consonants (L, N, T) while repositioning A and S.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓), so the word starts with S.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and L, but A is not in position 1 or 3, and L is not in position 2.
- Does not contain R, O, E, N, T.

Remaining letters to test: common ones like I, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place A and L in new positions while introducing new common consonants. The word must be S _ _ _ _.

Possible structure:
- S _ A _ _  (A in position 3 is invalid, so try position 2 or 4 or 5)
- S _ _ A _  (A in position 4)
- S _ _ _ A  (A in position 5)

Also, L must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 2).

Let’s try ""SALAD"":
- S (✓) in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new position for L).
- A in position 4 (but we already know A is in word, but this is redundant).
- D is new.

But ""SALAD"" has two A’s, which might not be efficient. Let’s try ""SALID"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- A in 2.
- L in 3.
- I is new.
- D is new.

This seems better as it introduces I and D while placing A and L in new spots.

But wait, ""SALID"" might not be a valid word. Let me think of a valid word starting with S, containing A and L, and introducing new letters.

Another option: ""SCALD"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- C is new.
- A in 3 (but A can't be in 3 from SLANT feedback: A(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: ""SPLAY"":
- S (✓) in 1.
- P is new.
- L in 3 (new for L).
- A in 4 (new for A).
- Y is new.

This seems valid and meets all constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A (position 4) and L (position 3).
- Introduces P and Y.
- No forbidden letters (R, O, E, N, T).

   - P is not in the word.
   - L (✓) in position 3.
   - A (✓) in position 4.
   - Y is not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Word structure: S _ L A _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, L, A
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, N, T, P, Y
- Position constraints:
  - Position 2: Cannot be A (from SLANT feedback: A(-) in position 3, but this doesn't directly constrain position 2). However, from SLANT, A is not in position 3, and from SPLAY, A is in position 4, so A could be in position 2 or 5.
  - Position 5: No constraints yet except that it can't be any of the excluded letters.

Valid letters left to consider for position 2 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ L A _ and use remaining letters. The most common ending after ""SLA"" is ""UGHT"" but that's 6 letters. Common 5-letter words:
- SQUAL (but Q and U together might be less common)
- SCALA (but has second A which is already in position 4)
- SGLAD (not a word)
- SCLAD (not a word)
- SFLAK (not a word)
- SULAM (not a word)
- SULFA (not a word)
- SULAK (not a word)

Looking at the remaining letters, ""D"" is common and fits:
- S L A D _ but we need 5 letters and position 2 is unknown.

Wait, structure is S _ L A _, so:
- S [?] L A [?]

Possible combinations:
- S C L A M
- S C L A R (but R is excluded)
- S C L A P (P excluded)
- S C L A K
- S C L A D
- S C L A V
- S C L A S (but S is already in position 1)
- S C L A H

""SCALD"" was considered before but A was in position 4 which was already confirmed. ""SCALD"" is S C A L D but structure is S _ L A _, so S C L A D would be S C L A D - but that's not a word.

Another approach: position 2 must be a consonant not yet excluded, and position 5 must be a consonant not yet excluded.

Looking at common words:
- S C L A D - not valid
- S C L A M - ""SCLAM"" not valid
- S C L A V - ""SCLAV"" not valid
- S C L A K - ""SCLAK"" not valid

Wait, ""SQUAL"" is a valid word meaning ""a great outcry"":
- S Q U A L
- S (✓) in 1
- Q (new)
- U (new)
- A (✓) in 4
- L (✓) in 3

This fits S _ L A _ structure with Q and U as new letters.

""SQUAL"" seems to be the best next guess as it introduces two new common letters (Q, U) while confirming the known positions.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - L is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - N, T are not in the word.

3. SPLAY → S(✓) P(x) L(✓) A(✓) Y(x)
   - S (✓) in position 1.
   - L (✓) in position 3.
   - A (✓) in position 4.
   - P, Y are not in the word.

4. SQUAL → S(✓) Q(x) U(x) A(✓) L(-)
   - S (✓) in position 1.
   - Q is not in the word.
   - U is not in the word.
   - A (✓) in position 4.
   - L is in the word but not in position 5 (since L(-) means it's in the word but not in that position).

Current constraints:
- Word must be S _ L A _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed).
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, N, T, P, Y, Q, U.
- L must be in position 2 or 5, but from SQUAL feedback L is not in position 5, so L must be in position 2.
- Therefore the word is S L L A _ but this has two L's which seems unlikely.
Wait, no: positions are fixed as S _ L A _, and L must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 5 and already placed in 3 from SPLAY). This would make the word S L L A _, but this seems impossible as L can't be in 3 and 2 at the same time.

Re-examining:
From SPLAY: L is in position 3 (✓).
From SQUAL: L(-) in position 5 means L is in the word but not in position 5, which is already satisfied as L is in position 3.
Thus, the word structure remains S _ L A _, with L in position 3.

Now, position 2 must be a consonant not yet used and not excluded. Excluded letters so far: R, O, E, N, T, P, Y, Q, U.
Remaining possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words with structure S _ L A _:
- S C L A M
- S C L A D
- S C L A V
- S C L A K
- S C L A S (invalid, S already in 1)
- S C L A R (R excluded)

""SCALD"" is S C A L D but structure is S _ L A _, so S C L A D - this is not a valid word.
""SCALM"" is not valid.
""SCALV"" is not valid.
""SCALK"" is not valid.

Looking at remaining letters, ""D"" is common:
- S C L A D - not valid
- S C L A M - ""SCLAM"" not valid
- S C L A K - ""SCLAK"" not valid

Realizing that with S _ L A _ and L in position 3, the only valid word seems to be ""SCALA"" but that has A in position 2 and 5, but A is already in position 4. This seems impossible.

Wait, re-examining the constraints:
- Word must be S _ L A _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed).
- Position 2: must be a consonant not excluded (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W).
- Position 5: must be a consonant not excluded.

Looking at valid words:
- S C L A M - ""SCLAM"" not valid
- S C L A D - ""SCLAD"" not valid
- S C L A V - ""SCLAV"" not valid
- S C L A K - ""SCLAK"" not valid
- S C L A S - invalid
- S B L A M - ""SBLAM"" not valid
- S D L A M - ""SDLAM"" not valid
- S F L A M - ""SFLAM"" not valid
- S G L A M - ""SGLAM"" not valid
- S H L A M - ""SHLAM"" not valid
- S K L A M - ""SKLAM"" not valid
- S V L A M - ""SVLAM"" not valid
- S W L A M - ""SWLAM"" not valid

Realizing that ""SCLAM"" is not a valid English word, but ""SCALD"" is S C A L D which doesn't fit S _ L A _. This suggests that the only possible word is ""SCLAM"" which is invalid.

Re-examining the constraints more carefully:
- Word is S _ L A _.
- L is in position 3 (from SPLAY).
- From SQUAL, L(-) in position 5 means L is not in position 5, which is already satisfied.
- Position 2 must be a consonant not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W.
- Position 5 must be a consonant not excluded.

Looking at valid words:
- S C L A M - invalid
- S C L A D - invalid
- S C L A V - invalid
- S C L A K - invalid
- S C L A S - invalid
- S C L A B - invalid
- S C L A G - invalid
- S C L A H - invalid
- S C L A I - invalid (I is vowel)
- S C L A M - invalid

This seems impossible. Realizing that the only valid word fitting S _ L A _ with these constraints is ""SCALA"" but that would require A in position 5, which is possible.

""SCALA"" is S C A L A:
- S (✓) in 1
- C (new)
- A (in position 3, but from SLANT A is not in position 3) - invalid

This suggests that the word must be ""SCLAD"" but that's not valid. Realizing that the only possible word is ""SCALD"" but structure doesn't fit.

Re-examining: perhaps position 2 is a vowel? But from SLANT, A is not in position 3, and from SPLAY A is in position 4, so A could be in position 2 or 5.

Looking for words S A L A _:
- S A L A M - ""SALAM"" not valid
- S A L A D - ""SALAD"" - valid word!

""SALAD"" is S A L A D:
- S (✓) in 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- L (✓) in 3
- A (✓) in 4
- D is new

This fits all constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains L in position 3 and A in position 4.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- D is new letter.
- No excluded letters used.

Thus, the next guess should be ""SALAD"".
