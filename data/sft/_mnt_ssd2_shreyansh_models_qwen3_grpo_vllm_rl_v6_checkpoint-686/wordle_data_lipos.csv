For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps eliminate many possibilities early. However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very frequent letters. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starting word that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E.
- Letters definitely present: O, S.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- POSIT: has O and S, but also contains I and T (no A/R/E). O is in position 2, S in position 3 – both allowed.
- SPOIL: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SLOTH: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- STOIC: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SONGS: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 2, S in position 1 and 5 – allowed.

Between POSIT and SONGS, POSIT seems slightly better because it introduces new consonants (P, T) that might help narrow things down.

So I’ll go with POSIT.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, P, I.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the mystery word must contain the letters {O, S, P, I} and one additional letter that has not yet been tried (and must not be A, R, E, T).  
Possible extra letters (common ones not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

We also know the positions:

- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5  
- S cannot be in 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5  
- P cannot be in 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- I cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need to place these four letters plus one new letter in a 5-letter word while respecting the positional bans.

Word: O S P _ I → need a consonant not yet used. Let’s try “N” → O S P N I → “OSPNI” – not a valid English word.

Option 2:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 1.  
Word: _ S P O I → pick “B” → B S P O I → “BSPOI” – invalid.

Option 3:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O → “SPINO” – valid (short for spinous or a type of plant).

Option 4:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not a valid word.

Option 5:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 5, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S I _ P → pick “N” → O S I N P – not valid.

Option 6:

Word: O S _ P I → pick “N” → O S N P I – not valid.

Option 9:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: I S P _ O → pick “N” → I S P N O – not valid.

Option 10:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 5, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ O P → pick “N” → S I N O P – not valid.

Option 11:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 12:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 4, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ I O → pick “N” → S P N I O – not valid.

Option 13:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: I P _ O S → pick “N” → I P N O S – not valid.

Option 14:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 1, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: P S I _ O → pick “N” → P S I N O – not valid.

Option 15:  
Place O in position 3 (but feedback says O is not in position 3), so skip.

Option 16:  
Place O in position 2 (but feedback says O is not in position 2), so skip.

Option 17:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 4, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 18:  
Place S in position 5, O in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 19:

Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O – valid (short for spinous or a plant).

This seems to be the best valid candidate found.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps eliminate many possibilities early. However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very frequent letters. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starting word that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E.
- Letters definitely present: O, S.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- POSIT: has O and S, but also contains I and T (no A/R/E). O is in position 2, S in position 3 – both allowed.
- SPOIL: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SLOTH: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- STOIC: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SONGS: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 2, S in position 1 and 5 – allowed.

Between POSIT and SONGS, POSIT seems slightly better because it introduces new consonants (P, T) that might help narrow things down.

So I’ll go with POSIT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(-) S(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: POSIT → P(-) O(-) S(-) I(-) T(x)

What we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, P, I.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the mystery word must contain the letters {O, S, P, I} and one additional letter that has not yet been tried (and must not be A, R, E, T).  
Possible extra letters (common ones not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

We also know the positions:

- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5  
- S cannot be in 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5  
- P cannot be in 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- I cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need to place these four letters plus one new letter in a 5-letter word while respecting the positional bans.

Let’s try to find a valid arrangement:

Option 1:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S P _ I → need a consonant not yet used. Let’s try “N” → O S P N I → “OSPNI” – not a valid English word.

Option 2:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 1.  
Word: _ S P O I → pick “B” → B S P O I → “BSPOI” – invalid.

Option 3:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O → “SPINO” – valid (short for spinous or a type of plant).

Option 4:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not a valid word.

Option 5:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 5, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S I _ P → pick “N” → O S I N P – not valid.

Option 6:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 7:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 4, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ P O → pick “N” → S I N P O – not valid.

Option 8:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 4, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: O S _ P I → pick “N” → O S N P I – not valid.

Option 9:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: I S P _ O → pick “N” → I S P N O – not valid.

Option 10:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 5, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ O P → pick “N” → S I N O P – not valid.

Option 11:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 12:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 4, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ I O → pick “N” → S P N I O – not valid.

Option 13:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: I P _ O S → pick “N” → I P N O S – not valid.

Option 14:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 1, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: P S I _ O → pick “N” → P S I N O – not valid.

Option 15:  
Place O in position 3 (but feedback says O is not in position 3), so skip.

Option 16:  
Place O in position 2 (but feedback says O is not in position 2), so skip.

Option 17:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 4, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 18:  
Place S in position 5, O in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 19:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O – valid (short for spinous or a plant).

This seems to be the best valid candidate found.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):  
A, R, E, T, N

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓):  
O, S, P, I

Positional restrictions from the “-” marks:

1. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ S must be in position 2.

2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3  
   ⇒ P must be in position 4 or 5.

3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5  
   ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 3.

4. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ O must be in position 1.

So we have:

- Position 1: O (only possible letter left is O)
- Position 2: S (only possible letter left is S)
- Position 3: I or another letter, but must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken)
- Position 4: P or another letter, but must be P (since P must be in 4 or 5 and 5 is open)
- Position 5: whatever is left

But wait: if we lock O in 1, S in 2, I in 3, then P must be in 4 or 5.  
But position 4 is already open, so P could be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try both cases:

Case A: P in position 4  
Then word looks like: O S I P _  
We need one more letter that is NOT A, R, E, T, N and hasn’t been used yet.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

A valid English word fitting O S I P _ is “OSIPI” – but that’s not a word.  
“OSI” + “P” + “?” – nothing obvious.

Case B: P in position 5  
Then word looks like: O S _ _ P  
Position 3 must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken).  
So: O S I _ P  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIKP” – not a word.  
“OSIGP” – not a word.  
“OSIMB” – not a word.  
“OSIHP” – not a word.  
“OSICP” – not a word.  
“OSIDP” – not a word.  
“OSIUP” – not a word.  
“OSIVP” – not a word.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIYP” – not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me re-examine the positional restrictions.

Wait, the feedback for SPINO was:

S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

This means:

- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the positional restrictions are:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 1, 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 4 or 5.
3. I: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.

But that’s impossible: both I and O cannot be in position 1.  
Therefore, my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-reading the feedback:

SPINO feedback:
S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

Each letter’s feedback corresponds to its position in SPINO:

- Position 1: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1.
- Position 2: P(-) → P is in word but not in position 2.
- Position 3: I(-) → I is in word but not in position 3.
- Position 4: N(x) → N is not in word.
- Position 5: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 5.

So corrected positional restrictions:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 1, 4, or 5.
3. I: not in 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 2.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 4.

But position 2 is already S, so I must be in 1 or 2, but 2 is S, so I must be in 1.

Thus:

- Position 1: I or O
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: O or ?
- Position 5: ?

Also, P must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try:

Case 1: I in 1, O in 4  
Word: I S _ O _  
P must be in 1, 4, or 5. 1 is I, 4 is O, so P must be in 5.  
Thus: I S _ O P  
Need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
Valid English word: I S M O P – “ISMOP” – not valid.  
I S L O P – “ISLOP” – not valid.  
I S B O P – “ISBOP” – not valid.  
I S D O P – “ISDOP” – not valid.  
I S G O P – “ISGOP” – not valid.  
I S H O P – “ISHOP” – valid! (short for “ishop” or a proper noun, but Wordle accepts “ISHOP” as a valid 5-letter word).

Case 2: I in 1, O in 1 – impossible.  
Case 3: O in 1, I in 1 – impossible.  

Thus the only valid candidate is ISHOP.

</think>

<guess>ISHOP</guess>",ISHOP,"Let’s tabulate what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):  
A, R, E, T, N

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓):  
O, S, P, I

Positional restrictions from the “-” marks:

1. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ S must be in position 2.

2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3  
   ⇒ P must be in position 4 or 5.

3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5  
   ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 3.

4. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ O must be in position 1.

So we have:

- Position 1: O (only possible letter left is O)
- Position 2: S (only possible letter left is S)
- Position 3: I or another letter, but must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken)
- Position 4: P or another letter, but must be P (since P must be in 4 or 5 and 5 is open)
- Position 5: whatever is left

But wait: if we lock O in 1, S in 2, I in 3, then P must be in 4 or 5.  
But position 4 is already open, so P could be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try both cases:

Case A: P in position 4  
Then word looks like: O S I P _  
We need one more letter that is NOT A, R, E, T, N and hasn’t been used yet.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

A valid English word fitting O S I P _ is “OSIPI” – but that’s not a word.  
“OSI” + “P” + “?” – nothing obvious.

Case B: P in position 5  
Then word looks like: O S _ _ P  
Position 3 must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken).  
So: O S I _ P  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIKP” – not a word.  
“OSIGP” – not a word.  
“OSIMB” – not a word.  
“OSIHP” – not a word.  
“OSICP” – not a word.  
“OSIDP” – not a word.  
“OSIUP” – not a word.  
“OSIVP” – not a word.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIYP” – not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me re-examine the positional restrictions.

Wait, the feedback for SPINO was:

S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

This means:

- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the positional restrictions are:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 1, 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 4 or 5.
3. I: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.

But that’s impossible: both I and O cannot be in position 1.  
Therefore, my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-reading the feedback:

SPINO feedback:
S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

Each letter’s feedback corresponds to its position in SPINO:

- Position 1: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1.
- Position 2: P(-) → P is in word but not in position 2.
- Position 3: I(-) → I is in word but not in position 3.
- Position 4: N(x) → N is not in word.
- Position 5: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 5.

So corrected positional restrictions:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 1, 4, or 5.
3. I: not in 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 2.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 4.

But position 2 is already S, so I must be in 1 or 2, but 2 is S, so I must be in 1.

Thus:

- Position 1: I or O
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: O or ?
- Position 5: ?

Also, P must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try:

Case 1: I in 1, O in 4  
Word: I S _ O _  
P must be in 1, 4, or 5. 1 is I, 4 is O, so P must be in 5.  
Thus: I S _ O P  
Need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
Valid English word: I S M O P – “ISMOP” – not valid.  
I S L O P – “ISLOP” – not valid.  
I S B O P – “ISBOP” – not valid.  
I S D O P – “ISDOP” – not valid.  
I S G O P – “ISGOP” – not valid.  
I S H O P – “ISHOP” – valid! (short for “ishop” or a proper noun, but Wordle accepts “ISHOP” as a valid 5-letter word).

Case 2: I in 1, O in 1 – impossible.  
Case 3: O in 1, I in 1 – impossible.  

Thus the only valid candidate is ISHOP.",Guess 4: ISHOP -> FEEDBACK: I(-) S(-) H(x) O(✓) P(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps eliminate many possibilities early. However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very frequent letters. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starting word that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E.
- Letters definitely present: O, S.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- POSIT: has O and S, but also contains I and T (no A/R/E). O is in position 2, S in position 3 – both allowed.
- SPOIL: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SLOTH: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- STOIC: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SONGS: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 2, S in position 1 and 5 – allowed.

Between POSIT and SONGS, POSIT seems slightly better because it introduces new consonants (P, T) that might help narrow things down.

So I’ll go with POSIT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(-) S(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: POSIT → P(-) O(-) S(-) I(-) T(x)

What we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, P, I.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the mystery word must contain the letters {O, S, P, I} and one additional letter that has not yet been tried (and must not be A, R, E, T).  
Possible extra letters (common ones not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

We also know the positions:

- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5  
- S cannot be in 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5  
- P cannot be in 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- I cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need to place these four letters plus one new letter in a 5-letter word while respecting the positional bans.

Let’s try to find a valid arrangement:

Option 1:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S P _ I → need a consonant not yet used. Let’s try “N” → O S P N I → “OSPNI” – not a valid English word.

Option 2:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 1.  
Word: _ S P O I → pick “B” → B S P O I → “BSPOI” – invalid.

Option 3:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O → “SPINO” – valid (short for spinous or a type of plant).

Option 4:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not a valid word.

Option 5:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 5, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S I _ P → pick “N” → O S I N P – not valid.

Option 6:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 7:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 4, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ P O → pick “N” → S I N P O – not valid.

Option 8:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 4, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: O S _ P I → pick “N” → O S N P I – not valid.

Option 9:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: I S P _ O → pick “N” → I S P N O – not valid.

Option 10:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 5, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ O P → pick “N” → S I N O P – not valid.

Option 11:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 12:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 4, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ I O → pick “N” → S P N I O – not valid.

Option 13:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: I P _ O S → pick “N” → I P N O S – not valid.

Option 14:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 1, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: P S I _ O → pick “N” → P S I N O – not valid.

Option 15:  
Place O in position 3 (but feedback says O is not in position 3), so skip.

Option 16:  
Place O in position 2 (but feedback says O is not in position 2), so skip.

Option 17:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 4, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 18:  
Place S in position 5, O in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 19:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O – valid (short for spinous or a plant).

This seems to be the best valid candidate found.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):  
A, R, E, T, N

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓):  
O, S, P, I

Positional restrictions from the “-” marks:

1. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ S must be in position 2.

2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3  
   ⇒ P must be in position 4 or 5.

3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5  
   ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 3.

4. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ O must be in position 1.

So we have:

- Position 1: O (only possible letter left is O)
- Position 2: S (only possible letter left is S)
- Position 3: I or another letter, but must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken)
- Position 4: P or another letter, but must be P (since P must be in 4 or 5 and 5 is open)
- Position 5: whatever is left

But wait: if we lock O in 1, S in 2, I in 3, then P must be in 4 or 5.  
But position 4 is already open, so P could be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try both cases:

Case A: P in position 4  
Then word looks like: O S I P _  
We need one more letter that is NOT A, R, E, T, N and hasn’t been used yet.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

A valid English word fitting O S I P _ is “OSIPI” – but that’s not a word.  
“OSI” + “P” + “?” – nothing obvious.

Case B: P in position 5  
Then word looks like: O S _ _ P  
Position 3 must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken).  
So: O S I _ P  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIKP” – not a word.  
“OSIGP” – not a word.  
“OSIMB” – not a word.  
“OSIHP” – not a word.  
“OSICP” – not a word.  
“OSIDP” – not a word.  
“OSIUP” – not a word.  
“OSIVP” – not a word.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIYP” – not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me re-examine the positional restrictions.

Wait, the feedback for SPINO was:

S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

This means:

- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the positional restrictions are:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 1, 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 4 or 5.
3. I: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.

But that’s impossible: both I and O cannot be in position 1.  
Therefore, my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-reading the feedback:

SPINO feedback:
S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

Each letter’s feedback corresponds to its position in SPINO:

- Position 1: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1.
- Position 2: P(-) → P is in word but not in position 2.
- Position 3: I(-) → I is in word but not in position 3.
- Position 4: N(x) → N is not in word.
- Position 5: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 5.

So corrected positional restrictions:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 1, 4, or 5.
3. I: not in 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 2.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 4.

But position 2 is already S, so I must be in 1 or 2, but 2 is S, so I must be in 1.

Thus:

- Position 1: I or O
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: O or ?
- Position 5: ?

Also, P must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try:

Case 1: I in 1, O in 4  
Word: I S _ O _  
P must be in 1, 4, or 5. 1 is I, 4 is O, so P must be in 5.  
Thus: I S _ O P  
Need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
Valid English word: I S M O P – “ISMOP” – not valid.  
I S L O P – “ISLOP” – not valid.  
I S B O P – “ISBOP” – not valid.  
I S D O P – “ISDOP” – not valid.  
I S G O P – “ISGOP” – not valid.  
I S H O P – “ISHOP” – valid! (short for “ishop” or a proper noun, but Wordle accepts “ISHOP” as a valid 5-letter word).

Case 2: I in 1, O in 1 – impossible.  
Case 3: O in 1, I in 1 – impossible.  

Thus the only valid candidate is ISHOP.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):  
A, R, E, T, N, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
O, S, P, I

Positional information from the latest feedback (ISHOP):

- I(-): I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- S(-): S is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- H(x): H is NOT in the word.  
- O(✓): O is in the word AND in position 4.  
- P(-): P is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word has the form:

_ _ _ O _

and we know:

- Position 1: cannot be I, A, R, E, T, N, H.  
- Position 2: cannot be S, I, A, R, E, T, N, H.  
- Position 3: cannot be I, A, R, E, T, N, H.  
- Position 5: cannot be P, A, R, E, T, N, H.

Also:

- S must be in the word but not in position 2.  
- P must be in the word but not in position 5.  
- I must be in the word but not in position 1.

So possible placements:

- S can be in 1, 3, or 5.  
- P can be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- I can be in 2, 3, or 5.

We need to place S, P, I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 while respecting the bans.

Let’s list all valid permutations:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known:    ? ? ? O ?

Constraints:

- 1: not I, A, R, E, T, N, H  
- 2: not S, I, A, R, E, T, N, H  
- 3: not I, A, R, E, T, N, H  
- 5: not P, A, R, E, T, N, H

Letters left to place: S, P, I (each must appear once).

Possible letters for each position:

1: S, P, I (but not I) → S, P  
2: S, P, I (but not S, I) → P  
3: S, P, I (but not I) → S, P  
5: S, P, I (but not P, I) → S  

But we have three letters (S, P, I) and five positions, but position 4 is fixed as O. Actually, we have three letters to place in three positions (1, 2, 3, 5) but only three letters. Wait, no: the word has five letters, and we know four of them: positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with S, P, I and one more letter. But we only have S, P, I as known letters in the word. Actually, the word must contain exactly S, P, I, O. Since O is in position 4, the other four positions must contain S, P, I and one more letter. But we have only S, P, I as known letters in the word, so the fifth letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet eliminated. But we have only S, P, I, O as letters in the word. Wait, the word is 5 letters and must contain S, P, I, O. So the fifth letter must be one of S, P, I, O. But O is already in position 4. So the other letters are S, P, I. So the word is a permutation of S, P, I, O with O fixed in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ O _ and the first four letters must be S, P, I, O in some order. But we have five positions. Wait, this suggests the word must contain S, P, I, O and one more letter. But from the feedback, only these four letters have been marked as present. The fifth letter must be something else not yet tested. But we have only a few letters left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

But we have to use S, P, I, O plus one other letter. Given the constraints, let’s try to find a word that fits.

But looking at the constraints:

- O is in position 4.  
- S must be in 1, 3, or 5.  
- P must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- I must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Option 7:

“P I B O S” – “PIBOS” – not valid.  
…  
“P I L O S” – “PILOS” – valid! (as in “pilose” – though it’s usually 6 letters, “PILOS” is acceptable in Wordle).

Word: P _ I O S

“I P B O S” – “IPBOS” – not valid.

“I P L O S” – “IPLOS” – not valid.  

Option 10:

Word: I _ P O S  
Need a letter for 2.  
“I B P O S” – “IBPOS” – not valid.  
…  
“I L P O S” – “ILPOS” – not valid.  

It appears the only plausible candidate is “PILOS”, even though it’s uncommon. Let me double-check if there are other possibilities.

Another approach: the word must be a permutation of S, P, I, O plus one new letter, with O fixed at 4. The only remaining letters are from B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y. Let’s try “D”:

Word: _ _ _ O D – but D is not in the known letters, and we have no evidence it’s in the word. Similarly for other letters.

Given the constraints, “PILOS” seems to be the only possible arrangement that fits all feedback.

Thus, the next guess is PILOS.

So the word has the form:

So possible placements:

“I B P O S” – “IBPOS” – not valid.  
…  
“I L P O S” – “ILPOS” – not valid.  

It appears the only plausible candidate is “PILOS”, even though it’s uncommon. Let me double-check if there are other possibilities.

Another approach: the word must be a permutation of S, P, I, O plus one new letter, with O fixed at 4. The only remaining letters are from B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y. Let’s try “D”:

Word: _ _ _ O D – but D is not in the known letters, and we have no evidence it’s in the word. Similarly for other letters.

Given the constraints, “PILOS” seems to be the only possible arrangement that fits all feedback.

Thus, the next guess is PILOS.",Guess 5: PILOS -> FEEDBACK: P(-) I(✓) L(-) O(✓) S(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps eliminate many possibilities early. However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very frequent letters. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starting word that should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E.
- Letters definitely present: O, S.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- POSIT: has O and S, but also contains I and T (no A/R/E). O is in position 2, S in position 3 – both allowed.
- SPOIL: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SLOTH: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- STOIC: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 3 (forbidden), so skip.
- SONGS: has O and S, no A/R/E. O is in position 2, S in position 1 and 5 – allowed.

Between POSIT and SONGS, POSIT seems slightly better because it introduces new consonants (P, T) that might help narrow things down.

So I’ll go with POSIT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(-) S(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: POSIT → P(-) O(-) S(-) I(-) T(x)

What we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, P, I.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the mystery word must contain the letters {O, S, P, I} and one additional letter that has not yet been tried (and must not be A, R, E, T).  
Possible extra letters (common ones not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

We also know the positions:

- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5  
- S cannot be in 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5  
- P cannot be in 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- I cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need to place these four letters plus one new letter in a 5-letter word while respecting the positional bans.

Let’s try to find a valid arrangement:

Option 1:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S P _ I → need a consonant not yet used. Let’s try “N” → O S P N I → “OSPNI” – not a valid English word.

Option 2:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 1.  
Word: _ S P O I → pick “B” → B S P O I → “BSPOI” – invalid.

Option 3:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O → “SPINO” – valid (short for spinous or a type of plant).

Option 4:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not a valid word.

Option 5:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 5, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O S I _ P → pick “N” → O S I N P – not valid.

Option 6:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 7:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 4, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ P O → pick “N” → S I N P O – not valid.

Option 8:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 2, P in position 4, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: O S _ P I → pick “N” → O S N P I – not valid.

Option 9:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 3, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: I S P _ O → pick “N” → I S P N O – not valid.

Option 10:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 1, P in position 5, I in position 2, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S I _ O P → pick “N” → S I N O P – not valid.

Option 11:  
Place O in position 1, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 12:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 4, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ I O → pick “N” → S P N I O – not valid.

Option 13:  
Place O in position 4, S in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 1, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: I P _ O S → pick “N” → I P N O S – not valid.

Option 14:  
Place O in position 5, S in position 2, P in position 1, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: P S I _ O → pick “N” → P S I N O – not valid.

Option 15:  
Place O in position 3 (but feedback says O is not in position 3), so skip.

Option 16:  
Place O in position 2 (but feedback says O is not in position 2), so skip.

Option 17:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 4, P in position 2, I in position 5, and pick a new letter for position 3.  
Word: S P _ O I → pick “N” → S P N O I – not valid.

Option 18:  
Place S in position 5, O in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: O P I _ S → pick “N” → O P I N S – not valid.

Option 19:  
Place S in position 1, O in position 5, P in position 2, I in position 3, and pick a new letter for position 4.  
Word: S P I _ O → pick “N” → S P I N O – valid (short for spinous or a plant).

This seems to be the best valid candidate found.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):  
A, R, E, T, N

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓):  
O, S, P, I

Positional restrictions from the “-” marks:

1. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ S must be in position 2.

2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3  
   ⇒ P must be in position 4 or 5.

3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5  
   ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 3.

4. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5  
   ⇒ O must be in position 1.

So we have:

- Position 1: O (only possible letter left is O)
- Position 2: S (only possible letter left is S)
- Position 3: I or another letter, but must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken)
- Position 4: P or another letter, but must be P (since P must be in 4 or 5 and 5 is open)
- Position 5: whatever is left

But wait: if we lock O in 1, S in 2, I in 3, then P must be in 4 or 5.  
But position 4 is already open, so P could be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try both cases:

Case A: P in position 4  
Then word looks like: O S I P _  
We need one more letter that is NOT A, R, E, T, N and hasn’t been used yet.  
Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

A valid English word fitting O S I P _ is “OSIPI” – but that’s not a word.  
“OSI” + “P” + “?” – nothing obvious.

Case B: P in position 5  
Then word looks like: O S _ _ P  
Position 3 must be I (since I must be in 1 or 3 and 1 is taken).  
So: O S I _ P  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIKP” – not a word.  
“OSIGP” – not a word.  
“OSIMB” – not a word.  
“OSIHP” – not a word.  
“OSICP” – not a word.  
“OSIDP” – not a word.  
“OSIUP” – not a word.  
“OSIVP” – not a word.  
“OSIWP” – not a word.  
“OSIYP” – not a word.  

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me re-examine the positional restrictions.

Wait, the feedback for SPINO was:

S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

This means:

- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the positional restrictions are:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 1, 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 4 or 5.
3. I: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1.

But that’s impossible: both I and O cannot be in position 1.  
Therefore, my earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-reading the feedback:

SPINO feedback:
S(-) P(-) I(-) N(x) O(-)

Each letter’s feedback corresponds to its position in SPINO:

- Position 1: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1.
- Position 2: P(-) → P is in word but not in position 2.
- Position 3: I(-) → I is in word but not in position 3.
- Position 4: N(x) → N is not in word.
- Position 5: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 5.

So corrected positional restrictions:

1. S: not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 2.
2. P: not in 2, 3 ⇒ must be in 1, 4, or 5.
3. I: not in 3, 4, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 2.
4. O: not in 2, 3, 5 ⇒ must be in 1 or 4.

But position 2 is already S, so I must be in 1 or 2, but 2 is S, so I must be in 1.

Thus:

- Position 1: I or O
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: O or ?
- Position 5: ?

Also, P must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try:

Case 1: I in 1, O in 4  
Word: I S _ O _  
P must be in 1, 4, or 5. 1 is I, 4 is O, so P must be in 5.  
Thus: I S _ O P  
Need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, E, T, N.  
Valid English word: I S M O P – “ISMOP” – not valid.  
I S L O P – “ISLOP” – not valid.  
I S B O P – “ISBOP” – not valid.  
I S D O P – “ISDOP” – not valid.  
I S G O P – “ISGOP” – not valid.  
I S H O P – “ISHOP” – valid! (short for “ishop” or a proper noun, but Wordle accepts “ISHOP” as a valid 5-letter word).

Case 2: I in 1, O in 1 – impossible.  
Case 3: O in 1, I in 1 – impossible.  

Thus the only valid candidate is ISHOP.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (×):  
A, R, E, T, N, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
O, S, P, I

Positional information from the latest feedback (ISHOP):

- I(-): I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- S(-): S is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- H(x): H is NOT in the word.  
- O(✓): O is in the word AND in position 4.  
- P(-): P is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word has the form:

_ _ _ O _

and we know:

- Position 1: cannot be I, A, R, E, T, N, H.  
- Position 2: cannot be S, I, A, R, E, T, N, H.  
- Position 3: cannot be I, A, R, E, T, N, H.  
- Position 5: cannot be P, A, R, E, T, N, H.

Also:

- S must be in the word but not in position 2.  
- P must be in the word but not in position 5.  
- I must be in the word but not in position 1.

So possible placements:

- S can be in 1, 3, or 5.  
- P can be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- I can be in 2, 3, or 5.

We need to place S, P, I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 while respecting the bans.

Let’s list all valid permutations:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known:    ? ? ? O ?

Constraints:

- 1: not I, A, R, E, T, N, H  
- 2: not S, I, A, R, E, T, N, H  
- 3: not I, A, R, E, T, N, H  
- 5: not P, A, R, E, T, N, H

Letters left to place: S, P, I (each must appear once).

Possible letters for each position:

1: S, P, I (but not I) → S, P  
2: S, P, I (but not S, I) → P  
3: S, P, I (but not I) → S, P  
5: S, P, I (but not P, I) → S  

But we have three letters (S, P, I) and five positions, but position 4 is fixed as O. Actually, we have three letters to place in three positions (1, 2, 3, 5) but only three letters. Wait, no: the word has five letters, and we know four of them: positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with S, P, I and one more letter. But we only have S, P, I as known letters in the word. Actually, the word must contain exactly S, P, I, O. Since O is in position 4, the other four positions must contain S, P, I and one more letter. But we have only S, P, I as known letters in the word, so the fifth letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet eliminated. But we have only S, P, I, O as letters in the word. Wait, the word is 5 letters and must contain S, P, I, O. So the fifth letter must be one of S, P, I, O. But O is already in position 4. So the other letters are S, P, I. So the word is a permutation of S, P, I, O with O fixed in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ O _ and the first four letters must be S, P, I, O in some order. But we have five positions. Wait, this suggests the word must contain S, P, I, O and one more letter. But from the feedback, only these four letters have been marked as present. The fifth letter must be something else not yet tested. But we have only a few letters left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

But we have to use S, P, I, O plus one other letter. Given the constraints, let’s try to find a word that fits.

But looking at the constraints:

- O is in position 4.  
- S must be in 1, 3, or 5.  
- P must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- I must be in 2, 3, or 5.  

Let’s try possible placements:

“I B P O S” – “IBPOS” – not valid.  
…  
“I L P O S” – “ILPOS” – not valid.  

It appears the only plausible candidate is “PILOS”, even though it’s uncommon. Let me double-check if there are other possibilities.

Another approach: the word must be a permutation of S, P, I, O plus one new letter, with O fixed at 4. The only remaining letters are from B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y. Let’s try “D”:

Word: _ _ _ O D – but D is not in the known letters, and we have no evidence it’s in the word. Similarly for other letters.

Given the constraints, “PILOS” seems to be the only possible arrangement that fits all feedback.

Thus, the next guess is PILOS.

Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps eliminate many possibilities early. However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very frequent letters. \n\nAfter considering these, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it\'s a balanced starting word that should provide good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.\n- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).\n- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).\n- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E.\n- Letters definitely present: O, S.\n- O is not in position 3.\n- S is not in position 4.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains O and S.\n- Does NOT contain A, R, E.\n- Places O somewhere other than position 3.\n- Places S somewhere other than position 4.\n\nLet’s look for words that fit these constraints.

From the latest feedback on PILOS:

P(-) I(✓) L(-) O(✓) S(✓)

This tells us:

- P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O is in the word AND in position 4 (✓).
- S is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So the word has now been determined to be:

_ I _ O S

with the remaining letters to place being P and L, and one more unknown letter (since we have 5 positions and 4 letters confirmed: I, O, S, plus P and L).

But wait: we have 5 positions and the letters I, O, S are fixed in positions 2, 4, 5. We still need letters for positions 1 and 3. From the feedback, P and L are in the word but in wrong positions. Also, we have eliminated many letters (A, R, E, T, N, H, and now positions for P and L are constrained).

Let’s list what we know:

- Letters in the word: I, O, S, P, L (since P and L are marked as in the word but in wrong positions).
- Positions:
  1: cannot be P (from PILOS feedback P(-) means P not in position 1).
  2: I (✓).
  3: cannot be L (from PILOS L(-) means L not in position 3).
  4: O (✓).
  5: S (✓).

So the word structure is: _ I _ O S, with letters P and L to place in positions 1 and 3 (but P cannot be in 1 and L cannot be in 3).

Thus:

- Position 1 must be L (since P cannot be here).
- Position 3 must be P (since L cannot be here).

Therefore, the word must be L I P O S.

Let me check if this is a valid 5-letter English word: ""LIPOS"" – yes, it’s a valid variant spelling or short form in some contexts, and Wordle accepts it as a valid word.

So the next guess is LIPOS.
