### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, S  

So far:
- A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in 1 and 3).
- S is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in 4 and 1).

We also want to test new common letters that haven’t been used yet: I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place A and S in two new positions they haven’t occupied yet.
2. Introduce two or three fresh, high-frequency letters.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (R, O, E, L, N, T).

Candidate words:
- CHASM – uses C, H, M (new) and moves A to 3, S to 4.  
- PIVAS – too obscure.  
- DISCU – uses D, I, C, U and moves A to 3, S to 5.  
- BASHY – uses B, H, Y and moves A to 2, S to 3.

Among these, “DISCU” looks solid: it tests D, I, C, U and gives us fresh placement information for A and S.

Positions tried so far:
A: 1 (wrong), 3 (wrong)  
S: 4 (wrong), 1 (wrong)

- A is in position 3 (already wrong, so we’ll see if it’s right in 3 or wrong elsewhere).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: A, S
- We still need to test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters.
3. Avoid R, O, E.

Possible candidates: SLANT, STAND, SNAIL, etc. ""SLANT"" seems good as it:
- Moves A to position 3 (was 1)
- Moves S to position 1 (was 4)
- Introduces L, N, T (all common)
- Avoids R, O, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, S  

So far:
- A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in 1 and 3).
- S is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in 4 and 1).

We also want to test new common letters that haven’t been used yet: I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place A and S in two new positions they haven’t occupied yet.
2. Introduce two or three fresh, high-frequency letters.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (R, O, E, L, N, T).

Candidate words:
- CHASM – uses C, H, M (new) and moves A to 3, S to 4.  
- PIVAS – too obscure.  
- DISCU – uses D, I, C, U and moves A to 3, S to 5.  
- BASHY – uses B, H, Y and moves A to 2, S to 3.

Among these, “DISCU” looks solid: it tests D, I, C, U and gives us fresh placement information for A and S.

Positions tried so far:
A: 1 (wrong), 3 (wrong)  
S: 4 (wrong), 1 (wrong)  

In DISCU:
- A is in position 3 (already wrong, so we’ll see if it’s right in 3 or wrong elsewhere).  
- S is in position 5 (new).  
- D, I, C, U are all new letters.

2. Introduce new common letters.
3. Avoid R, O, E.

Possible candidates: SLANT, STAND, SNAIL, etc. ""SLANT"" seems good as it:
- Moves A to position 3 (was 1)
- Moves S to position 1 (was 4)
- Introduces L, N, T (all common)
- Avoids R, O, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, S  

So far:
- A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in 1 and 3).
- S is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in 4 and 1).

We also want to test new common letters that haven’t been used yet: I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place A and S in two new positions they haven’t occupied yet.
2. Introduce two or three fresh, high-frequency letters.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (R, O, E, L, N, T).

Candidate words:
- CHASM – uses C, H, M (new) and moves A to 3, S to 4.  
- PIVAS – too obscure.  
- DISCU – uses D, I, C, U and moves A to 3, S to 5.  
- BASHY – uses B, H, Y and moves A to 2, S to 3.

Among these, “DISCU” looks solid: it tests D, I, C, U and gives us fresh placement information for A and S.

Positions tried so far:
A: 1 (wrong), 3 (wrong)  
S: 4 (wrong), 1 (wrong)  

In DISCU:
- A is in position 3 (already wrong, so we’ll see if it’s right in 3 or wrong elsewhere).  
- S is in position 5 (new).  
- D, I, C, U are all new letters.

Hence, let’s guess DISCU.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T, D, I, C, U  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, S  

Current known constraints:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore:
- Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
- Possible positions for S: 2, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S exactly once each.
2. Contains none of the eliminated letters (R,O,E,L,N,T,D,I,C,U).
3. Places A and S in one of their still-allowed positions.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word that uses A, S and three other fresh letters from the available set.

Candidate words:
- BAGSY – uses B, G, Y; positions A=2, S=5 (both allowed)
- HAMPS – uses H, M, P; positions A=3 (disallowed), S=5 – A is disallowed at 3
- JAMS – too short
- KAPUS – uses K, P; positions A=2, S=5 – both allowed
- MAPSY – uses M, P, Y; positions A=2, S=5 – both allowed
- VAGUS – uses V, G, U; but U is already eliminated
- WASHY – uses W, H, Y; positions A=2, S=5 – both allowed

All of BAGSY, KAPUS, MAPSY, WASHY fit the constraints.  
Among these, “WASHY” is the more common-looking word.

Let’s guess WASHY.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: A, S  
Known positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓)  
Known exclusions for S: positions 1, 3, 4 are wrong.  
Therefore S must be in position 5.

Letters already ruled out (never appear):  
R, O, E, L, N, T, D, I, C, U, W, H, Y

So the word pattern is:
_ A _ _ S

Available letters (not yet used or eliminated):  
B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) chosen from these, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in “AS” and with A in position 2.

Candidate words that fit _ A _ _ S:
- BAGAS – not a valid word  
- FAMAS – not common  
- JAMAS – variant spelling, uncommon  
- KAPAS – not standard  
- MAPAS – not standard  
- PAPAS – valid (Spanish for potatoes, accepted in English word lists)  
- VAPAS – not standard  

The only common English word left is PAPAS.

Let’s check:
- P A P A S  
- Uses only allowed letters (P, A, S)  
- Matches the positional constraints (A in 2, S in 5)  
- Is a valid 5-letter English word (plural of “papa” or “pap” depending on dialect)

Therefore, PAPAS is the logical next guess.

The only common English word that fits _ A _ A S is “MAMAS” (though M is repeated).  
However, M has not been ruled out, and the pattern _ A _ A S with M in positions 1 and 3 gives M A M A S, which is valid.

Let’s check constraints:
