For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (x) – O is not in the word.
- S (-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good letters left to try (common ones): T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A strong next guess is “TRIPS”:
- T, R, I, P, S – all allowed so far.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from feedback). Oops, that’s no good.

Let’s try “FIRST”:
- F, I, R, S, T – all allowed.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4). So this is invalid.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P – all allowed.
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “DRIPS”:
- D, R, I, P, S – all allowed.
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “STIRP”:
- S, T, I, R, P – all allowed.
- R is in position 4 (allowed; we only know S is not in position 4).

This looks valid. Another option is “TRIPS” but R would be in position 2 again. “STIRP” seems the best so far.

1. From AROSE:

2. From STIRP:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - T and P are NOT in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, T, P
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- I cannot be in position 3

Possible positions for each letter:
R: 1, 3, 5
S: 2, 3, 5
I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Letters we can still use (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word using R, S, I plus two other allowed letters, respecting the position constraints.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If R is in position 1, then S and I must go in 2,3,5 or similar.
- If R is in position 3, then S and I must go in 2,5 or similar.
- If R is in position 5, then S and I must go in 2,3,4.

Looking for valid words:
- R _ _ _ _ : R must be followed by allowed letters. Possible: RISIN (but N is allowed), RICHS (but H is allowed), etc.
- _ R _ _ _ : R in position 2 is forbidden.
- _ _ R _ _ : R in position 3.
- _ _ _ R _ : R in position 4 is forbidden.
- _ _ _ _ R : R in position 5.

Let’s try “RISIN”:
- R(1), I(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)
- Contains R, S, I
- R not in 2 or 4 (ok, it’s in 1)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3, ok)
- I not in 3 (it’s in 2 and 4, ok)
- Letters used: R, I, S, N – all allowed so far.

This seems valid. Another candidate could be “RINSE” but E is forbidden. “RISKS” has S twice. “RISIN” looks good.

- O (x) – O is not in the word.
- S (-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good letters left to try (common ones): T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A strong next guess is “TRIPS”:
- T, R, I, P, S – all allowed so far.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from feedback). Oops, that’s no good.

Let’s try “FIRST”:
- F, I, R, S, T – all allowed.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4). So this is invalid.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P – all allowed.
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “DRIPS”:
- D, R, I, P, S – all allowed.
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “STIRP”:
- S, T, I, R, P – all allowed.
- R is in position 4 (allowed; we only know S is not in position 4).
- S is in position 1 (allowed).

This looks valid. Another option is “TRIPS” but R would be in position 2 again. “STIRP” seems the best so far.

Let’s try “TRIPS” again but note R is in position 2 – invalid.

Another option: “PRIST” (but this isn’t a valid word).

“STIRP” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. From AROSE:
   - A, O, E are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. From STIRP:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - T and P are NOT in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, T, P
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- I cannot be in position 3

Possible positions for each letter:
R: 1, 3, 5
S: 2, 3, 5
I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Letters we can still use (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word using R, S, I plus two other allowed letters, respecting the position constraints.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If R is in position 1, then S and I must go in 2,3,5 or similar.
- If R is in position 3, then S and I must go in 2,5 or similar.
- If R is in position 5, then S and I must go in 2,3,4.

Looking for valid words:
- R _ _ _ _ : R must be followed by allowed letters. Possible: RISIN (but N is allowed), RICHS (but H is allowed), etc.
- _ R _ _ _ : R in position 2 is forbidden.
- _ _ R _ _ : R in position 3.
- _ _ _ R _ : R in position 4 is forbidden.
- _ _ _ _ R : R in position 5.

- Contains R, S, I
- R not in 2 or 4 (ok, it’s in 1)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3, ok)
- I not in 3 (it’s in 2 and 4, ok)

- I – in the word and **correctly placed** in position 2 (✓)

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must come from the unused alphabet, excluding the forbidden set above. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Position constraints:
- R can only be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, 4)
- S can only be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, 4), but position 2 is already I, so S must be in position 5.

Therefore:
- Position 5 must be S
- Position 3 or 5 must be R – but position 5 is already S, so R must be in position 3.

So far: _ I R S _

We need a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the allowed set (C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.).

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (x) – O is not in the word.
- S (-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good letters left to try (common ones): T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A strong next guess is “TRIPS”:
- T, R, I, P, S – all allowed so far.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from feedback). Oops, that’s no good.

Let’s try “FIRST”:
- F, I, R, S, T – all allowed.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4). So this is invalid.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P – all allowed.
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “DRIPS”:
- D, R, I, P, S – all allowed.
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “STIRP”:
- S, T, I, R, P – all allowed.
- R is in position 4 (allowed; we only know S is not in position 4).
- S is in position 1 (allowed).

This looks valid. Another option is “TRIPS” but R would be in position 2 again. “STIRP” seems the best so far.

Let’s try “TRIPS” again but note R is in position 2 – invalid.

Another option: “PRIST” (but this isn’t a valid word).

“STIRP” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. From AROSE:
   - A, O, E are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. From STIRP:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - T and P are NOT in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Must contain: R, S, I
- Must NOT contain: A, O, E, T, P
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- I cannot be in position 3

Possible positions for each letter:
R: 1, 3, 5
S: 2, 3, 5
I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Letters we can still use (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word using R, S, I plus two other allowed letters, respecting the position constraints.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If R is in position 1, then S and I must go in 2,3,5 or similar.
- If R is in position 3, then S and I must go in 2,5 or similar.
- If R is in position 5, then S and I must go in 2,3,4.

Looking for valid words:
- R _ _ _ _ : R must be followed by allowed letters. Possible: RISIN (but N is allowed), RICHS (but H is allowed), etc.
- _ R _ _ _ : R in position 2 is forbidden.
- _ _ R _ _ : R in position 3.
- _ _ _ R _ : R in position 4 is forbidden.
- _ _ _ _ R : R in position 5.

Let’s try “RISIN”:
- R(1), I(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)
- Contains R, S, I
- R not in 2 or 4 (ok, it’s in 1)
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3, ok)
- I not in 3 (it’s in 2 and 4, ok)
- Letters used: R, I, S, N – all allowed so far.

This seems valid. Another candidate could be “RINSE” but E is forbidden. “RISKS” has S twice. “RISIN” looks good.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are **not** in the word (×):
A, O, E, T, P, N

Letters that **are** in the word (✓ or –):
- R – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4  
- S – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4  
- I – in the word and **correctly placed** in position 2 (✓)

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must come from the unused alphabet, excluding the forbidden set above. Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Position constraints:
- R can only be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, 4)
- S can only be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, 4), but position 2 is already I, so S must be in position 5.

Therefore:
- Position 5 must be S
- Position 3 or 5 must be R – but position 5 is already S, so R must be in position 3.

So far: _ I R S _

We need a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the allowed set (C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.).

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit _ I R S _:
- CIRCS – but C is repeated, and C is allowed, but let’s check: C I R C S – but C is allowed and not forbidden, but we have no info against it. However, double C might be unlikely.
- DIRKS – D, I, R, K, S – K is allowed (not in forbidden list), and all letters are unique.
- FIRNS – but N is forbidden.
- GIRDS – G, I, R, D, S – all allowed and unique.
-HIRDS – H, I, R, D, S – all allowed and unique.
- MIRKS – M, I, R, K, S – all allowed and unique.
- VIRUS – but U is allowed, but V is allowed, but we have to check: V, I, R, U, S – all allowed.

DIRKS, GIRDS, HIRDS, MIRKS, VIRUS all fit the pattern and constraints. Among these, DIRKS seems like a strong candidate.

Let’s choose DIRKS.

Confirmed facts after five guesses:

1. Fixed positions:
   - 2 = I
   - 3 = R
   - 5 = S
   Pattern: _ I R _ S

2. Letters **not** in the word (×):
   A, O, E, T, P, N, D, K, C

3. Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4:
   B, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

4. We need two **different** letters for positions 1 and 4 from the allowed set.

Possible valid combinations:
   - B I R B S → BIRBS (valid word, B repeated)  
   - F I R F S → FIRFS (rare, F repeated)  
   - G I R G S → GIRGS (rare, G repeated)  
   - H I R H S →HIRHS (invalid)  
   - L I R L S → LIRLS (invalid)  
   - M I R M S → MIRMS (invalid)  
   - U I R U S → UIrus (invalid)  
   - V I R V S → VIRVS (invalid)  
   - W I R W S → WIRWS (invalid)  
   - Y I R Y S → YIRYS (invalid)  

The only valid word with repeated letters is **BIRBS** (B in positions 1 and 4).  
Other single-occurrence candidates: **FIRFS, GIRGS** are not standard.  
The most common English word fitting _ I R _ S with distinct allowed letters is **FIRMS** (F, I, R, M, S).  
Check letters: F and M are both allowed (not in forbidden list) and distinct.

Therefore, **FIRMS** is the best next guess.
