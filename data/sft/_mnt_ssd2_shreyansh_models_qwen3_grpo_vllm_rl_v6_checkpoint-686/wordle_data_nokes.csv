For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O, S, E in different positions.
2. Adds new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A and R.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T is a new common consonant.
- O moves to position 2 (was 3).
- L is a new common consonant.
- E moves to position 5 (was 5) – but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is bad.

Let me try “STONE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- T (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but feedback says O is not in position 3. So this is bad.

Next try “TOSSE” – but double S might not be optimal.

Better: “TOSIE” – but I is untested, E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “SHEET”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- H (2) – new letter.
- E (3) – allowed.
- E (4) – double E, but both positions 3 and 4 are allowed for E (only position 5 is forbidden).
- T (5) – new letter.

But double E might not be ideal.

Another option: “SPOKE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- P (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but O cannot be in position 3. So this is bad.

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – again position 3 for O is invalid.

Try “SOLVE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- L (3) – new letter.
- V (4) – new letter.
- E (5) – but E cannot be in position 5. So this is bad.

Next: “SNOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- N (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOTE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Let’s list positions:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

A valid arrangement: S, O, T, E, L – forming “SOTEL” (but not a common word).

Common word: “OCEAN” – but contains A (invalid).

“OFTEN”:
- O (1) – allowed.
- F (2) – new.
- T (3) – new.
- E (4) – allowed.
- N (5) – new.
This uses O, E, and adds F, T, N. All positions are allowed.

But does it use S? No, so we lose info.

We must include S, O, E.

Let’s try “SLEOT” – not a word.

“OESIS” – contains S but also I, S, etc.

“SOOTH” – contains O twice, but O can’t be in position 3.

“SOUSE” – contains S, O, E, adds U.

Positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- U (3) – new.
- S (4) – but S cannot be in position 4 (from feedback). So this is bad.

“SOUSE” has S in position 4 – invalid.

“SOWER” – but R is invalid.

“SOLID” – but D is new, positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed.
- L (3) – new.
- I (4) – new.
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, and adds L, I, D. All positions are allowed.

“SOLID” seems good.

Check:
- Letters: S, O, L, I, D.
- No A, R.
- O not in 3 – here it’s in 2: OK.
- S not in 4 – here it’s in 1: OK.
- E is not present – but we know E is in the word! So this is bad.

We must include E.

So far we have S, O, E, and need two more letters avoiding A, R.

Let’s try “POSED”:
- P (1) – new.
- O (2) – allowed.
- S (3) – allowed (was 4, now 3).
- E (4) – allowed (was 5, now 4).
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, E in allowed positions and adds P, D.

“POSED” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- S is now in position 3 (was 4) – allowed.
- E is now in position 4 (was 5) – allowed.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3) – allowed.
- No A, R.
- All new letters P, D.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O, S, E in different positions.
2. Adds new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A and R.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T is a new common consonant.
- O moves to position 2 (was 3).
- L is a new common consonant.
- E moves to position 5 (was 5) – but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is bad.

Let me try “STONE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- T (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but feedback says O is not in position 3. So this is bad.

Next try “TOSSE” – but double S might not be optimal.

Better: “TOSIE” – but I is untested, E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “SHEET”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- H (2) – new letter.
- E (3) – allowed.
- E (4) – double E, but both positions 3 and 4 are allowed for E (only position 5 is forbidden).
- T (5) – new letter.

But double E might not be ideal.

Another option: “SPOKE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- P (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but O cannot be in position 3. So this is bad.

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – again position 3 for O is invalid.

Try “SOLVE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- L (3) – new letter.
- V (4) – new letter.
- E (5) – but E cannot be in position 5. So this is bad.

Next: “SNOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- N (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOTE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Let’s list positions:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

A valid arrangement: S, O, T, E, L – forming “SOTEL” (but not a common word).

Common word: “OCEAN” – but contains A (invalid).

“OFTEN”:
- O (1) – allowed.
- F (2) – new.
- T (3) – new.
- E (4) – allowed.
- N (5) – new.
This uses O, E, and adds F, T, N. All positions are allowed.

But does it use S? No, so we lose info.

We must include S, O, E.

Let’s try “SLEOT” – not a word.

“OESIS” – contains S but also I, S, etc.

“SOOTH” – contains O twice, but O can’t be in position 3.

“SOUSE” – contains S, O, E, adds U.

Positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- U (3) – new.
- S (4) – but S cannot be in position 4 (from feedback). So this is bad.

“SOUSE” has S in position 4 – invalid.

“SOWER” – but R is invalid.

“SOLID” – but D is new, positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed.
- L (3) – new.
- I (4) – new.
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, and adds L, I, D. All positions are allowed.

“SOLID” seems good.

Check:
- Letters: S, O, L, I, D.
- No A, R.
- O not in 3 – here it’s in 2: OK.
- S not in 4 – here it’s in 1: OK.
- E is not present – but we know E is in the word! So this is bad.

We must include E.

So far we have S, O, E, and need two more letters avoiding A, R.

Let’s try “POSED”:
- P (1) – new.
- O (2) – allowed.
- S (3) – allowed (was 4, now 3).
- E (4) – allowed (was 5, now 4).
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, E in allowed positions and adds P, D.

“POSED” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- S is now in position 3 (was 4) – allowed.
- E is now in position 4 (was 5) – allowed.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3) – allowed.
- No A, R.
- All new letters P, D.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O, S, E in different positions.
2. Adds new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A and R.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T is a new common consonant.
- O moves to position 2 (was 3).
- L is a new common consonant.
- E moves to position 5 (was 5) – but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is bad.

Let me try “STONE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- T (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but feedback says O is not in position 3. So this is bad.

Next try “TOSSE” – but double S might not be optimal.

Better: “TOSIE” – but I is untested, E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “SHEET”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- H (2) – new letter.
- E (3) – allowed.
- E (4) – double E, but both positions 3 and 4 are allowed for E (only position 5 is forbidden).
- T (5) – new letter.

But double E might not be ideal.

Another option: “SPOKE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- P (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but O cannot be in position 3. So this is bad.

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – again position 3 for O is invalid.

Try “SOLVE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- L (3) – new letter.
- V (4) – new letter.
- E (5) – but E cannot be in position 5. So this is bad.

Next: “SNOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- N (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOTE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Let’s list positions:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

A valid arrangement: S, O, T, E, L – forming “SOTEL” (but not a common word).

Common word: “OCEAN” – but contains A (invalid).

“OFTEN”:
- O (1) – allowed.
- F (2) – new.
- T (3) – new.
- E (4) – allowed.
- N (5) – new.
This uses O, E, and adds F, T, N. All positions are allowed.

But does it use S? No, so we lose info.

We must include S, O, E.

Let’s try “SLEOT” – not a word.

“OESIS” – contains S but also I, S, etc.

“SOOTH” – contains O twice, but O can’t be in position 3.

“SOUSE” – contains S, O, E, adds U.

Positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- U (3) – new.
- S (4) – but S cannot be in position 4 (from feedback). So this is bad.

“SOUSE” has S in position 4 – invalid.

“SOWER” – but R is invalid.

“SOLID” – but D is new, positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed.
- L (3) – new.
- I (4) – new.
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, and adds L, I, D. All positions are allowed.

“SOLID” seems good.

Check:
- Letters: S, O, L, I, D.
- No A, R.
- O not in 3 – here it’s in 2: OK.
- S not in 4 – here it’s in 1: OK.
- E is not present – but we know E is in the word! So this is bad.

We must include E.

So far we have S, O, E, and need two more letters avoiding A, R.

Let’s try “POSED”:
- P (1) – new.
- O (2) – allowed.
- S (3) – allowed (was 4, now 3).
- E (4) – allowed (was 5, now 4).
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, E in allowed positions and adds P, D.

“POSED” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- S is now in position 3 (was 4) – allowed.
- E is now in position 4 (was 5) – allowed.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3) – allowed.
- No A, R.
- All new letters P, D.

This seems optimal.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in word: A, R
   - Letters in word but wrong positions: O, S, E

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Letters not in word: P, D
   - O is in the correct position 2.
   - E is in the correct position 4.
   - S is in the word but wrong position (currently at 3).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S, but S is not in position 3.
- Must not contain A, R, P, D.

Letters left to try: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits _ O _ E _ and contains S somewhere other than position 3.

Possible candidates:
- S in position 1: S O _ E _
- S in position 5: _ O _ E S

Let's think of common words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" (but R is invalid), ""SOKE"" (needs 5 letters), ""SOLAR"" (A,R invalid), ""SONIC"" (but C is new), ""SOUND"" (D invalid).
- _ O _ E S: ""COVES"" (but C is new), ""MOLES"" (L is new), ""GOLES"" (G is new), ""TOLES"" (T is new).

""MOLES"" seems good:
- M (new), O (correct position 2), L (new), E (correct position 4), S (position 5, which is allowed since S was not in position 3 before).

Check:
- Contains S, O, E in correct positions.
- Avoids A, R, P, D.
- Valid word.

Another option is ""TOLES"" but T is new and valid.

Between ""MOLES"" and ""TOLES"", ""MOLES"" is more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O, S, E in different positions.
2. Adds new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A and R.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T is a new common consonant.
- O moves to position 2 (was 3).
- L is a new common consonant.
- E moves to position 5 (was 5) – but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is bad.

Let me try “STONE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- T (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but feedback says O is not in position 3. So this is bad.

Next try “TOSSE” – but double S might not be optimal.

Better: “TOSIE” – but I is untested, E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “SHEET”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- H (2) – new letter.
- E (3) – allowed.
- E (4) – double E, but both positions 3 and 4 are allowed for E (only position 5 is forbidden).
- T (5) – new letter.

But double E might not be ideal.

Another option: “SPOKE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- P (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – but O cannot be in position 3. So this is bad.

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – again position 3 for O is invalid.

Try “SOLVE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- L (3) – new letter.
- V (4) – new letter.
- E (5) – but E cannot be in position 5. So this is bad.

Next: “SNOPE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- N (2) – new letter.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOTE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- L (2) – new.
- O (3) – invalid.

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Let’s list positions:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

A valid arrangement: S, O, T, E, L – forming “SOTEL” (but not a common word).

Common word: “OCEAN” – but contains A (invalid).

“OFTEN”:
- O (1) – allowed.
- F (2) – new.
- T (3) – new.
- E (4) – allowed.
- N (5) – new.
This uses O, E, and adds F, T, N. All positions are allowed.

But does it use S? No, so we lose info.

We must include S, O, E.

Let’s try “SLEOT” – not a word.

“OESIS” – contains S but also I, S, etc.

“SOOTH” – contains O twice, but O can’t be in position 3.

“SOUSE” – contains S, O, E, adds U.

Positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed (was 3, now 2).
- U (3) – new.
- S (4) – but S cannot be in position 4 (from feedback). So this is bad.

“SOUSE” has S in position 4 – invalid.

“SOWER” – but R is invalid.

“SOLID” – but D is new, positions:
- S (1) – allowed.
- O (2) – allowed.
- L (3) – new.
- I (4) – new.
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, and adds L, I, D. All positions are allowed.

“SOLID” seems good.

Check:
- Letters: S, O, L, I, D.
- No A, R.
- O not in 3 – here it’s in 2: OK.
- S not in 4 – here it’s in 1: OK.
- E is not present – but we know E is in the word! So this is bad.

We must include E.

So far we have S, O, E, and need two more letters avoiding A, R.

Let’s try “POSED”:
- P (1) – new.
- O (2) – allowed.
- S (3) – allowed (was 4, now 3).
- E (4) – allowed (was 5, now 4).
- D (5) – new.
This uses S, O, E in allowed positions and adds P, D.

“POSED” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- S is now in position 3 (was 4) – allowed.
- E is now in position 4 (was 5) – allowed.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3) – allowed.
- No A, R.
- All new letters P, D.

This seems optimal.

   - Letters in word but wrong positions: O, S, E

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Letters not in word: P, D
   - O is in the correct position 2.
   - E is in the correct position 4.
   - S is in the word but wrong position (currently at 3).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S, but S is not in position 3.
- Must not contain A, R, P, D.

Letters left to try: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits _ O _ E _ and contains S somewhere other than position 3.

Possible candidates:
- S in position 1: S O _ E _
- S in position 5: _ O _ E S

Let's think of common words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" (but R is invalid), ""SOKE"" (needs 5 letters), ""SOLAR"" (A,R invalid), ""SONIC"" (but C is new), ""SOUND"" (D invalid).
- _ O _ E S: ""COVES"" (but C is new), ""MOLES"" (L is new), ""GOLES"" (G is new), ""TOLES"" (T is new).

""MOLES"" seems good:
- M (new), O (correct position 2), L (new), E (correct position 4), S (position 5, which is allowed since S was not in position 3 before).

Check:
- Contains S, O, E in correct positions.
- Avoids A, R, P, D.
- Valid word.

Another option is ""TOLES"" but T is new and valid.

Between ""MOLES"" and ""TOLES"", ""MOLES"" is more common.

From the latest feedback:

CONES → C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

- C is not in the word.
- O is correctly at position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT at position 3.
- E is correctly at position 4.
- S is correctly at position 5.

So the pattern is: _ O _ E S  
and N must appear somewhere in the first or third position (since it can’t be at 3).

Letters already ruled out: A, R, P, D, M, L, B, C  
Letters still allowed: F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus N which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
- N O _ E S  (N at position 1)
- _ O N E S  (N at position 3)  – but feedback says N is NOT at position 3, so this is impossible.

Therefore, N must be at position 1, making the word N O _ E S.

The only common 5-letter word fitting N O _ E S is:

N O I E S  → ""NOIES"" (not a valid word)
N O T E S  → ""NOTES"" (valid word)

""NOTES"" uses T (a new letter) and fits the pattern perfectly.
