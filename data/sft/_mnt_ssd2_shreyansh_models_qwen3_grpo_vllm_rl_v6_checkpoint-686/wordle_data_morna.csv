### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O is in the word, not in position 3.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - R is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 2.
   - D and I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word, not in position 5.

Combining these facts:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, E, D, I.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – O cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

So the three required letters (A, R, O) must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5, with the following constraints:
- A can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- R can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- O can only be in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

Let’s try to place O in position 1 (its only remaining legal spot among the three), and then place A and R in the remaining two of positions 3,4,5, ensuring they don’t violate their exclusions.

Possible placements:
- O _ _ _ _  (position 1)
- Then A and R must go in positions 3,4,5, but:
  – A cannot be in position 2 (already satisfied).
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (already satisfied).

Let’s try O in 1, A in 3, R in 4: O A _ R _ → but we need 5 letters, so we need one more letter that is not S, E, D, I. Common unused letters: T, N, L, C, M, etc.

A word that fits: O A _ R _ → OATRN? Not a valid word. Let’s try O A _ _ R → O A C R? Not valid. Let’s try O _ A _ R → O T A N R? Not valid.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words that contain A, R, O exactly once each, avoid S, E, D, I, and satisfy the positional constraints.

A quick check of valid English words:
- ORANG: contains A, R, O; avoids forbidden letters; positions:
  – O in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden – R cannot be in 2), so discard.
- CROAK: C, R, O, A, K – contains all required letters; positions:
  – C (new), R in 2 (forbidden), so discard.
- COBRA: C, O, B, R, A – positions:
  – O in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Valid word.

Let’s verify COBRA:
- Letters: C, O, B, R, A – includes A, R, O once each; excludes S, E, D, I.
- Positional checks:
  – A is in 5 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – R is in 4 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – O is in 2 (not 3 or 5) – OK.

Therefore, COBRA is a valid next guess.

- ORANG: contains A, R, O; avoids forbidden letters; positions:
  – O in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden – R cannot be in 2), so discard.
- CROAK: C, R, O, A, K – contains all required letters; positions:
  – C (new), R in 2 (forbidden), so discard.
- COBRA: C, O, B, R, A – positions:
  – O in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Valid word.

Let’s verify COBRA:
- Letters: C, O, B, R, A – includes A, R, O once each; excludes S, E, D, I.
- Positional checks:
  – A is in 5 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – R is in 4 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – O is in 2 (not 3 or 5) – OK.

Therefore, COBRA is a valid next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and O (but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain S or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, and O in different positions than before.
2. Avoids S and E entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R moves from position 2 to 1 (allowed).
- A moves from position 1 to 2 (allowed).
- O moves from position 3 to 5 (allowed).
- Introduces D and I, which are common letters not yet tested.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O is in the word, not in position 3.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - R is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 2.
   - D and I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word, not in position 5.

Combining these facts:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, E, D, I.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – O cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

So the three required letters (A, R, O) must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5, with the following constraints:
- A can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- R can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- O can only be in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

Let’s try to place O in position 1 (its only remaining legal spot among the three), and then place A and R in the remaining two of positions 3,4,5, ensuring they don’t violate their exclusions.

Possible placements:
- O _ _ _ _  (position 1)
- Then A and R must go in positions 3,4,5, but:
  – A cannot be in position 2 (already satisfied).
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (already satisfied).

Let’s try O in 1, A in 3, R in 4: O A _ R _ → but we need 5 letters, so we need one more letter that is not S, E, D, I. Common unused letters: T, N, L, C, M, etc.

A word that fits: O A _ R _ → OATRN? Not a valid word. Let’s try O A _ _ R → O A C R? Not valid. Let’s try O _ A _ R → O T A N R? Not valid.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words that contain A, R, O exactly once each, avoid S, E, D, I, and satisfy the positional constraints.

A quick check of valid English words:
- ORANG: contains A, R, O; avoids forbidden letters; positions:
  – O in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden – R cannot be in 2), so discard.
- CROAK: C, R, O, A, K – contains all required letters; positions:

- COBRA: C, O, B, R, A – positions:
  – O in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Valid word.

Let’s verify COBRA:
- Letters: C, O, B, R, A – includes A, R, O once each; excludes S, E, D, I.
- Positional checks:
  – A is in 5 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – R is in 4 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – O is in 2 (not 3 or 5) – OK.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and O (but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain S or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, and O in different positions than before.
2. Avoids S and E entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R moves from position 2 to 1 (allowed).
- A moves from position 1 to 2 (allowed).
- O moves from position 3 to 5 (allowed).
- Introduces D and I, which are common letters not yet tested.

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O is in the word, not in position 3.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - R is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 2.
   - D and I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word, not in position 5.

Combining these facts:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, E, D, I.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – O cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

So the three required letters (A, R, O) must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5, with the following constraints:
- A can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- R can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 2).
- O can only be in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

Let’s try to place O in position 1 (its only remaining legal spot among the three), and then place A and R in the remaining two of positions 3,4,5, ensuring they don’t violate their exclusions.

Possible placements:
- O _ _ _ _  (position 1)
- Then A and R must go in positions 3,4,5, but:
  – A cannot be in position 2 (already satisfied).
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (already satisfied).

Let’s try O in 1, A in 3, R in 4: O A _ R _ → but we need 5 letters, so we need one more letter that is not S, E, D, I. Common unused letters: T, N, L, C, M, etc.

A word that fits: O A _ R _ → OATRN? Not a valid word. Let’s try O A _ _ R → O A C R? Not valid. Let’s try O _ A _ R → O T A N R? Not valid.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words that contain A, R, O exactly once each, avoid S, E, D, I, and satisfy the positional constraints.

A quick check of valid English words:
- ORANG: contains A, R, O; avoids forbidden letters; positions:
  – O in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden – R cannot be in 2), so discard.
- CROAK: C, R, O, A, K – contains all required letters; positions:
  – C (new), R in 2 (forbidden), so discard.
- COBRA: C, O, B, R, A – positions:
  – O in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Valid word.

Let’s verify COBRA:
- Letters: C, O, B, R, A – includes A, R, O once each; excludes S, E, D, I.
- Positional checks:
  – A is in 5 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – R is in 4 (not 1 or 2) – OK.
  – O is in 2 (not 3 or 5) – OK.

Therefore, COBRA is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: COBRA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) R(-) A(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on COBRA:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 4.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word:
- Has O in position 2 and A in position 5.
- Contains R somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Does not contain: S, E, D, I, C, B.

Known pattern: _ O _ _ A
Letters left to place: R plus any other letters not yet ruled out (must be from remaining common letters like T, N, L, M, etc.).

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not in {S, E, D, I, C, B} and include R exactly once (since R appears once in the word).

Possible placements for R:
- Position 1: R O _ _ A
- Position 3: _ O R _ A
- Position 4: _ O _ R A (but R cannot be in position 4, so discard)

So R must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s try R in position 1: R O _ _ A
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters (T, N, L, M, etc.).

Common valid words:
- R O T A _ – but A is already in position 5, so R O T A N? Not valid.
- R O T A L? Not valid.
- R O N A T? Not valid.

Try R in position 3: _ O R _ A
We need letters for positions 1 and 4. Possible combinations:
- T O R N A – valid word.
- T O R M A – not valid.
- N O R T A – not valid.
- L O R N A – not valid.

The only valid word fitting the pattern is TORN A, but TORN A is not a word. Wait, let’s check again.

Actually, TORN A is not valid. Let me think of other combinations.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with pattern _ O _ _ A, containing R not in position 4, and avoiding forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- T O R A N – not valid (A is in 5, so T O R A N is invalid as it has A in 4).
- T O N A R – not valid (R in 5, but A must be in 5).
- M O R A N – not valid.
- M O N A R – not valid.
- F O R A N – not valid.
- L O R A N – not valid.
- G O R A N – not valid.

Wait, let me systematically generate:

Pattern: ? O ? ? A
Must include R exactly once, not in position 4.
Letters allowed: any except S, E, D, I, C, B.

Possible positions for R: 1 or 3.

Case 1: R in position 1 → R O ? ? A
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters (T, N, L, M, etc.).
Possible valid words:
- R O T A N – not valid (A is in 5, so positions 3 and 4 are T and N, but word must be R O T N A or R O N T A, which are not words).
- R O N A T – not valid.
- R O T A L – not valid.

Case 2: R in position 3 → ? O R ? A
We need letters for positions 1 and 4.
Possible combinations:
- T O R N A – valid word.
- M O R N A – valid word.
- L O R N A – not valid.
- N O R T A – not valid.

Between TORN A and MORN A, both are valid. Let me check:
- TORN A: T O R N A – positions: T(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), A(5). This fits all constraints: O in 2, A in 5, R in 3 (not 4), and no forbidden letters.
- MORN A: M O R N A – same pattern, but M is allowed.

Both are valid, but let’s choose TORN A first.

- F is allowed (not in any prior forbidden list).
- O, R, N, A are confirmed in their positions.

Therefore, the word must be F O R N A.

The feedback from FORNA shows that positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are locked in as O-R-N-A.  
The only remaining unknown is position 1, and we now know it cannot be:
