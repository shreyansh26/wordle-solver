For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good vowel coverage. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage (3 vowels vs 2 in SLATE) and the letters are all very common.

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- DOES contain S and E, but:
  – S is not in the 4th position.
  – E is not in the 5th position.

Letters still available (so far): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, O).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S and E (since they must be present).
- Does NOT use A, R, or O.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""STEIN"" fits:
- Contains S (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5).
- Uses new common letters T, I, N.
- Does not use A, R, or O.

This will help us narrow down the positions of S and E further and test new letters.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, T, N.  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, I.

- In AROSE: S was in position 4 (wrong spot), E in position 5 (wrong spot).  
- In STEIN: S was in position 1 (wrong spot), E in position 3 (wrong spot), I in position 4 (wrong spot).

So:
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- I must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Places S, E, I in one of the allowed positions above.
4. Uses two additional letters from the remaining alphabet (letters not yet tested or excluded).

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is “WISPS”:
- Contains W, I, S, P, S → includes S, I (E is missing, but we can test E next if needed).  
However, it doesn’t include E, which we know is in the word. So this is bad.

Next candidate: “SPIKE”
- Contains S, P, I, K, E → includes S, I, E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 2,3,5) – wait, position 1 is not allowed for S (from STEIN feedback: S was in position 1 and marked wrong). So SPIKE is invalid.

Next candidate: “PIVES”
- Contains P, I, V, E, S.
- S is in position 5 (allowed: 2,3,5) – OK.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- DOES contain S and E, but:
  – S is not in the 4th position.
  – E is not in the 5th position.

Letters still available (so far): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, O).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S and E (since they must be present).
- Does NOT use A, R, or O.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""STEIN"" fits:
- Contains S (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5).
- Uses new common letters T, I, N.
- Does not use A, R, or O.

This will help us narrow down the positions of S and E further and test new letters.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, T, N.  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, I.

From the feedback:

- In AROSE: S was in position 4 (wrong spot), E in position 5 (wrong spot).  
- In STEIN: S was in position 1 (wrong spot), E in position 3 (wrong spot), I in position 4 (wrong spot).

So:
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- I must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, I.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Places S, E, I in one of the allowed positions above.
4. Uses two additional letters from the remaining alphabet (letters not yet tested or excluded).

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is “WISPS”:
- Contains W, I, S, P, S → includes S, I (E is missing, but we can test E next if needed).  
However, it doesn’t include E, which we know is in the word. So this is bad.

Next candidate: “SPIKE”
- Contains S, P, I, K, E → includes S, I, E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 2,3,5) – wait, position 1 is not allowed for S (from STEIN feedback: S was in position 1 and marked wrong). So SPIKE is invalid.

Next candidate: “PIVES”
- Contains P, I, V, E, S.
- S is in position 5 (allowed: 2,3,5) – OK.
- E is in position 4 (allowed: 1,2,4) – OK.
- I is in position 3 (allowed: 1,2,3,5) – OK.
- No A, R, O, T, N – OK.

This seems valid. Let’s go with PIVES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good vowel coverage. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage (3 vowels vs 2 in SLATE) and the letters are all very common.

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- DOES contain S and E, but:
  – S is not in the 4th position.
  – E is not in the 5th position.

Letters still available (so far): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, O).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S and E (since they must be present).
- Does NOT use A, R, or O.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""STEIN"" fits:
- Contains S (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5).
- Uses new common letters T, I, N.
- Does not use A, R, or O.

This will help us narrow down the positions of S and E further and test new letters.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, T, N.  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, I.

From the feedback:

- In AROSE: S was in position 4 (wrong spot), E in position 5 (wrong spot).  
- In STEIN: S was in position 1 (wrong spot), E in position 3 (wrong spot), I in position 4 (wrong spot).

So:
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- I must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, I.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Places S, E, I in one of the allowed positions above.
4. Uses two additional letters from the remaining alphabet (letters not yet tested or excluded).

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is “WISPS”:
- Contains W, I, S, P, S → includes S, I (E is missing, but we can test E next if needed).  
However, it doesn’t include E, which we know is in the word. So this is bad.

Next candidate: “SPIKE”
- Contains S, P, I, K, E → includes S, I, E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 2,3,5) – wait, position 1 is not allowed for S (from STEIN feedback: S was in position 1 and marked wrong). So SPIKE is invalid.

Next candidate: “PIVES”
- Contains P, I, V, E, S.
- S is in position 5 (allowed: 2,3,5) – OK.
- E is in position 4 (allowed: 1,2,4) – OK.
- I is in position 3 (allowed: 1,2,3,5) – OK.
- No A, R, O, T, N – OK.

This seems valid. Let’s go with PIVES.

Now we have:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, P, V.
- Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
  – I is in position 2 (✓).
  – E is in position 4 (✓).
  – S is in position 5 (✓).

So the word looks like: _ I _ E S.

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not A, R, O, T, N, P, V).

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ I _ E S.

Possible candidates:
- B I D E S – but ""BIDES"" is not a common word.
- C I D E S – ""CIDES"" is not valid.
- F I L E S – ""F I L E S"" is valid.
- G I V E S – but V is already excluded.
- H I K E S – ""HIKES"" is valid.
- L I K E S – ""LIKES"" is valid.
- M I C E S – ""MICES"" is not a word.
- W I D E S – ""WIDES"" is not common.

The most common valid words fitting _ I _ E S are ""F I L E S"", ""H I K E S"", and ""L I K E S"".

Let's check:
- ""F I L E S"": F and L are new letters, not yet tested.
- ""H I K E S"": H and K are new.
- ""L I K E S"": L and K are new.

All are valid. I'll choose ""F I L E S"" as it uses common letters F and L.

Pattern: _ I _ E S → F I L E S.
