### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- The remaining letters in the word must come from the unused alphabet, excluding R, S, E.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, S, E.
- Has 5 letters total.

Next, I want to test new common consonants while respecting the known letters. Good candidates are T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc. Since A and O must appear somewhere, I'll try to place them in new positions and surround them with fresh consonants.

A good second guess would be ""PLANT"":
- P and L are new consonants.
- N is another common consonant.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- T is a new consonant.
- This uses all new letters except A, which we know is in the word.

However, ""PLANT"" uses N and T which are good, but let's see if we can do better with more coverage. Another option is ""COATI"" but that has I which might not be optimal. 

""ALERT"" is tempting but contains E which we know is not in the word. 

""ADOPT"" has O and A but also P and T which are good. 

""ADOPT"" seems good:
- A in position 1 (but we know A is not in position 1 from first guess feedback), so this is bad.

""TOADY"" has T, O, A, D, Y - but Y is less common.

""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A - but B and I are less common.

""PAINT"" has P, A, I, N, T - but I is less common.

""PLANK"" has P, L, A, N, K - K is less common.

""PLANT"" seems best among these, even though it's not perfect. Let's go with ""PLANT"" as it introduces P, L, N, T while moving A to position 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- The remaining letters in the word must come from the unused alphabet, excluding R, S, E.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, S, E.
- Has 5 letters total.

Next, I want to test new common consonants while respecting the known letters. Good candidates are T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc. Since A and O must appear somewhere, I'll try to place them in new positions and surround them with fresh consonants.

A good second guess would be ""PLANT"":
- P and L are new consonants.
- N is another common consonant.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- T is a new consonant.
- This uses all new letters except A, which we know is in the word.

However, ""PLANT"" uses N and T which are good, but let's see if we can do better with more coverage. Another option is ""COATI"" but that has I which might not be optimal. 

""ALERT"" is tempting but contains E which we know is not in the word. 

""ADOPT"" has O and A but also P and T which are good. 

""ADOPT"" seems good:
- A in position 1 (but we know A is not in position 1 from first guess feedback), so this is bad.

""TOADY"" has T, O, A, D, Y - but Y is less common.

""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A - but B and I are less common.

""PAINT"" has P, A, I, N, T - but I is less common.

""PLANK"" has P, L, A, N, K - K is less common.

""PLANT"" seems best among these, even though it's not perfect. Let's go with ""PLANT"" as it introduces P, L, N, T while moving A to position 2.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)

Key deductions:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, P, L, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown): A, O
- We now know A is NOT in position 1 or 3, and O is NOT in position 3.

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O (each at least once)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, P, L, N, T
- Has A and O in positions different from their previous guesses (A not 1 or 3, O not 3)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these.  
A good candidate is “COBIA”:
- C, B, I are new letters.
- Contains both A and O.
- A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “DOCKA”:
- D, C, K are new letters.
- A and O are present.
- Positions: A in 5, O in 2 (both allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

“COBIA” is slightly more common, so I’ll go with that.

From the four guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
3. COBIA → C(✓) O(✓) B(-) I(x) A(-)
4. COBAY → C(✓) O(✓) B(-) A(✓) Y(x)

Key deductions:

- Fixed positions: C (1), O (2), A (4) → pattern C O _ A _
- Letters in the word: C, O, B, A
- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, P, L, N, T, I, Y
- B is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from COBIA and COBAY feedback), so B must be in position 3. But position 3 is already between B(-) in both COBIA and COBAY, meaning B is not in position 3. This creates a contradiction because the only remaining positions for B are 3 or 5, and both are excluded.

This implies our assumption that B is in the word must be re-evaluated. The feedback from COBIA shows B(-), meaning B is in the word but not in position 3. However, in COBAY, B is in position 3 and still marked (-), confirming B is not in position 3. The only remaining position for B is 5.

Thus, the pattern is: C O _ A B

Now we need a valid 5-letter word matching C O _ A B. The missing letter (position 3) must not be any of the excluded letters: R, S, E, P, L, N, T, I, Y.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W

Valid words fitting C O _ A B:
- COFAB (not valid)
- COGAB (not valid)
- COMAB (not valid)
- COHAB (valid - short for cohabitation)
- COVAB (not valid)
- COWAB (not valid)

The only valid word is ""COHAB"".

Let's verify:
- C(✓) O(✓) H(?) A(✓) B(?)
- H hasn't been ruled out.
- ""COHAB"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This fits all constraints.
