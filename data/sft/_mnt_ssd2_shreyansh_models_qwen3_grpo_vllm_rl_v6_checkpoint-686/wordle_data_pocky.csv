### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed).

I’ll try a word that places O in position 2 and tests new consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, N, I, T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE).

This should help narrow down remaining letters efficiently.

From the new feedback on POINT:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is P.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is O.
- I, N, T are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with P O _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven’t used yet)

We need three more letters for positions 3-5, using only the remaining letters. We should pick common letters to maximize information. Good candidates among the remaining letters: L, D, U, M, C, G, B, K.

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word starting with PO and using only allowed letters. Possible words:
- POKED (but E is excluded)
- POUND (but N is excluded)
- POLYP (but P is already used in position 1, and Y might be too rare)
- POLAR (but A and R are excluded)
- POGUE (but G, U, E – E excluded)
- POLLY (but Y might be too rare)
- POKAL (but K, A, L – A excluded)

""POUCH"" uses P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5). All letters are allowed (P, O confirmed; U, C, H not yet tested). This seems like a good next guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

Current knowledge:
- Positions 1 and 2 are P and O respectively.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, H
- Letters in the word but wrong position: C (from POUCH, C got ""-"")
- So C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven't used).

We need three more letters for positions 3-5, with C somewhere in 3 or 5 (since it can't be in 4).

Possible words:
- P O C _ _ (but C can't be in position 4, so position 3 is possible)
- P O _ C _ (position 4 is possible)
- P O _ _ C (position 5 is possible)

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with PO:
- POKED (E excluded)
- POLYP (Y possible, but P already used)
- POUCH (already tried)
- POGUE (E excluded)
- POLAR (A, R excluded)
- POKAL (A excluded)
- POCUL (U excluded)
- POKER (E, R excluded)
- POMPS (S excluded)
- PONCY (N excluded)
- POCKS (S excluded)
- POCKY (Y possible, but K and Y are less common)
- POCLO (O repeated, but O already in position 2)
- POCIT (I, T excluded)
- POGIS (S excluded)
- POGIO (I excluded)
- POCKO (K, O possible, but O already used)
- POCLO (same as above)
- POCIT (same as above)

Looking at remaining letters, possible candidates:
- P O C K Y (but Y is less common)
- P O C _ _ (need two more letters from remaining: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Let's try ""POCKY"" – but Y is less common and we have limited tries.
Another option: ""POCKS"" – S excluded.
""POCKO"" – O repeated, but O is already in position 2, so this is invalid (O can't appear twice unless it's in position 3, but that's allowed).

Wait, ""POCKO"" has O in position 3, which is allowed since O is already confirmed in position 2. But this seems unlikely.

Looking for better options:
- P O C _ _ (position 3 is C)
- P O _ C _ (position 4 is C)
- P O _ _ C (position 5 is C)

Let's try ""POCKY"" – but Y is less common.
Another option: ""PODGY"" (D, G, Y – all allowed)
""PODGY"" is a valid word meaning well-dressed.

Let's go with ""PODGY"":
- P(✓) O(✓) D G Y
- D, G, Y are new and allowed
- C is not used here, but we know C is in the word somewhere. Since C can't be in position 4, it must be in 3 or 5. ""PODGY"" doesn't use C, so this is okay for now to test other letters.

Actually, since we know C is in the word but not in position 4, it's better to include C in the next guess to confirm its position. Let's adjust.

We need to include C in position 3 or 5. Let's try:
- P O C _ _ (position 3 is C)
Possible words: ""POCKY"" (Y allowed), but Y is less common.
- P O _ _ C (position 5 is C)
Possible words: ""POMOC"" (invalid), ""POKOC"" (invalid), ""POLYC"" (invalid), ""PODLC"" (invalid).

Looking at valid words:
- ""POCKY"" is valid (Y is acceptable as a letter)
- ""PODGY"" is valid but doesn't use C
- ""POKED"" (E excluded)
- ""POLYP"" (Y possible, but P already used)

""POCKY"" seems the best to test C in position 3 and Y in position 5.

But let's check if ""POCKY"" is a valid word – yes, it's slang for ""pocket"" or well-dressed.

However, to maximize information, let's try ""POCKY"" as it includes C in position 3.

But looking back, we have only 6 tries, and we've used 3. Let's be strategic.

Actually, since C is in the word but not in position 4, and we need to place it in 3 or 5, let's try:

Possible: ""POMOC"" (invalid), ""POKOC"" (invalid), ""POLYC"" (invalid), ""PODGY"" (doesn't use C)

""POCKY"" seems the only valid option here.

But to maximize information, let's try ""POCKY"" to test C in position 3 and Y in position 5.

However, another valid word is ""POKED"" but E is excluded.
""POLYP"" has P in position 1, but P is already used in position 1.

Looking at remaining letters, ""POCKY"" seems the best to test C in position 3 and Y in position 5.

But let's try ""POCKY"":
- P(✓) O(✓) C(-) K Y
Wait, in POUCH, C was ""-"", meaning C is in the word but not in position 4. In POUCH, C was in position 4, so it can't be in position 4. In ""POCKY"", C is in position 3 – this is allowed.

Thus, ""POCKY"" is a valid guess to test C in position 3, K in position 4, and Y in position 5.

But we have limited tries, so let's choose the most likely word. ""POCKY"" is valid.

But looking at remaining letters, ""PODGY"" is also valid but doesn't use C. Since we know C is in the word, it's better to include C to confirm its position.

Thus, ""POCKY"" is the best next guess.

But wait, let's check if ""POCKY"" is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it's recognized in some dictionaries as slang.

However, to maximize information, let's try ""POCKY"".

But another approach: since we know C is in the word but not in position 4, and positions 1-2 are P-O, let's try to place C in position 3 and use remaining letters.

Thus, ""POCKY"" is the next logical guess.

But to be more certain, let's try ""POCKY"".

But looking at the letters remaining, ""POCKY"" uses C, K, Y – all allowed.

Thus, the final choice is ""POCKY"".

Based on the feedback:
- P and O are locked in positions 1 and 2.
