For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E somewhere.
2. Does NOT have A, R, or O.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already present).

Let me think of words that fit:
- S and E must appear, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since they were marked wrong-position).
- Possible positions: S could be in 1,2,3,5 and E could be in 1,2,3,4, but not both in 4 and 5.

Possible candidates:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E somewhere.
2. Does NOT have A, R, or O.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already present).

Let me think of words that fit:
- S and E must appear, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since they were marked wrong-position).
- Possible positions: S could be in 1,2,3,5 and E could be in 1,2,3,4, but not both in 4 and 5.

Possible candidates:
- STILE (but has O? No, but has I and L)
- SLICE (but has A? No, but has I and C)
- STONE (but has O - out)
- STEIN (but has A? No, but has I and N)
- SPEND (but has A? No, but has P, N, D)

""STILE"" seems good:
- S is in position 1 (new position)
- T, I, L, E are all new letters to test
- Doesn't contain A, R, or O

Current constraints after two guesses:

1. Letters known to be in the word:
   - S (now confirmed in position 1)
   - E (somewhere, but not in position 5)

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   A, R, O, T, I, L

3. Word pattern so far:
   S _ _ _ _   (S is locked in position 1)

4. Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I are out)
5. Remaining common consonants: N, D, P, C, B, G, H, M, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E (not in position 5), and avoiding all banned letters.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s brainstorm:
- S E _ _ _ : but E can’t be last, so this would leave SE###, but we’d need three more letters avoiding banned ones. However, E in position 2 might be too early.
- S _ E _ _ : E in position 3
- S _ _ E _ : E in position 4

Looking at S _ E _ _:
- S _ E _ _ : need two more consonants (or U) avoiding banned letters.
Good candidates: S, U, N, D, etc.

Possible words:
- SUEDE: S U E D E – but E appears twice, and we don’t know if E is allowed twice. Also D is untested.
- SNEEK: but K is allowed, but double E again.
- SUEFN: not a word.
- SUEDE seems the closest valid word, but let’s check another angle.

Looking at S _ _ E _:
- S P E N E – not a word.
- S C U E D – not a word.
- S N U E D – not a word.

Another approach: S _ _ _ E is impossible (E can’t be last).

Let me try S _ E _ _ again:
- S P E N D – but D is untested, and N is untested.
- S P E N D: S P E N D – valid word, uses P, N, D which are all untested, avoids banned letters, and E in position 3.

This seems optimal.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. Fixed letters  
   - Position 1: S (✓)  
   - Position 3: E (✓)  

   Word skeleton: S _ E _ _

2. Letters that are definitely in the word (but not yet in the right place)  
   - N (from SPEND and SNACK both marked “-” for N)  
   - K (from SNACK marked “-”)  

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
   A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, C  

4. Therefore the remaining alphabet pool for positions 2 and 4 includes  
   B, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the letter N must appear once (either in position 2 or 4).

5. Possible patterns  
   - If N is in position 2: S N E _ _  → need one more letter for position 4 (must be from allowed set)  
   - If N is in position 4: S _ E N _  → need one more letter for position 2  

6. Candidate words  
   - S N E _ _ :  
     – SNELL – contains L (banned)  
     – SNUG _ – too short  
     – SNEEK – uses K (allowed) but has double E (unknown if valid)  
     – SNEBY – not a real word  
   - S _ E N _ :  
     – SUE N _ – nothing real  
     – SGEN_ – nothing real  
     – SMELN – not a real word  

7. Best valid word left is SNEEK (but double E is risky).  
   However, we still have K unplaced and it must appear somewhere.  
   The only remaining place for K is position 4 in S _ E K _ or position 2 in S K E _ _.  
   SKEL_ is not valid; SKE_ _ with K in position 2 gives SKE_ _ and the only real word is SKELE but that’s 5 letters.  
   SKELE is a valid 5-letter word (archaic for skeleton) and uses K in position 2, E already fixed, and places N where?

Wait, we still need N somewhere and K somewhere.

<guess>SNEEK</guess>",SNEEK,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. Fixed letters  
   - Position 1: S (✓)  
   - Position 3: E (✓)  

   Word skeleton: S _ E _ _

2. Letters that are definitely in the word (but not yet in the right place)  
   - N (from SPEND and SNACK both marked “-” for N)  
   - K (from SNACK marked “-”)  

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
   A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, C  

4. Therefore the remaining alphabet pool for positions 2 and 4 includes  
   B, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the letter N must appear once (either in position 2 or 4).

5. Possible patterns  
   - If N is in position 2: S N E _ _  → need one more letter for position 4 (must be from allowed set)  
   - If N is in position 4: S _ E N _  → need one more letter for position 2  

6. Candidate words  
   - S N E _ _ :  
     – SNELL – contains L (banned)  
     – SNUG _ – too short  
     – SNEEK – uses K (allowed) but has double E (unknown if valid)  
     – SNEBY – not a real word  
   - S _ E N _ :  
     – SUE N _ – nothing real  
     – SGEN_ – nothing real  
     – SMELN – not a real word  

7. Best valid word left is SNEEK (but double E is risky).  
   However, we still have K unplaced and it must appear somewhere.  
   The only remaining place for K is position 4 in S _ E K _ or position 2 in S K E _ _.  
   SKEL_ is not valid; SKE_ _ with K in position 2 gives SKE_ _ and the only real word is SKELE but that’s 5 letters.  
   SKELE is a valid 5-letter word (archaic for skeleton) and uses K in position 2, E already fixed, and places N where?

Wait, we still need N somewhere and K somewhere.  
The only valid 5-letter word that fits S _ E _ _ with both N and K is:

S N E K _ – too short  
S K E N _ – S K E N T (but T banned)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E somewhere.
2. Does NOT have A, R, or O.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already present).

Let me think of words that fit:
- S and E must appear, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since they were marked wrong-position).
- Possible positions: S could be in 1,2,3,5 and E could be in 1,2,3,4, but not both in 4 and 5.

Possible candidates:
- STILE (but has O? No, but has I and L)
- SLICE (but has A? No, but has I and C)
- STONE (but has O - out)
- STEIN (but has A? No, but has I and N)
- SPEND (but has A? No, but has P, N, D)

""STILE"" seems good:
- S is in position 1 (new position)
- T, I, L, E are all new letters to test
- Doesn't contain A, R, or O

Current constraints after two guesses:

1. Letters known to be in the word:
   - S (now confirmed in position 1)
   - E (somewhere, but not in position 5)

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   A, R, O, T, I, L

3. Word pattern so far:
   S _ _ _ _   (S is locked in position 1)

4. Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I are out)
5. Remaining common consonants: N, D, P, C, B, G, H, M, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E (not in position 5), and avoiding all banned letters.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s brainstorm:
- S E _ _ _ : but E can’t be last, so this would leave SE###, but we’d need three more letters avoiding banned ones. However, E in position 2 might be too early.
- S _ E _ _ : E in position 3
- S _ _ E _ : E in position 4

Looking at S _ E _ _:
- S _ E _ _ : need two more consonants (or U) avoiding banned letters.
Good candidates: S, U, N, D, etc.

Possible words:
- SUEDE: S U E D E – but E appears twice, and we don’t know if E is allowed twice. Also D is untested.
- SNEEK: but K is allowed, but double E again.
- SUEFN: not a word.
- SUEDE seems the closest valid word, but let’s check another angle.

Looking at S _ _ E _:
- S P E N E – not a word.
- S C U E D – not a word.
- S N U E D – not a word.

Another approach: S _ _ _ E is impossible (E can’t be last).

Let me try S _ E _ _ again:
- S P E N D – but D is untested, and N is untested.
- S P E N D: S P E N D – valid word, uses P, N, D which are all untested, avoids banned letters, and E in position 3.

This seems optimal.

Guess 3: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(✓) N(-) D(x)

Current constraints:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. E is locked in position 3.
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D.
4. Remaining letters to test: N (somewhere, but not in position 4), plus other unused consonants and vowels.
5. Word pattern so far: S _ E _ _

Possible positions for N: 2, 4, or 5 (but it can’t be in 4, since it was marked wrong-position in SPEND). So N must be in 2 or 5.

Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are accounted for).
Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, third letter E, containing N (in position 2 or 5), and avoiding all banned letters.

Option 1: N in position 2 → S N E _ _
   - Need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) from allowed set.
   - Possible: S N E C K, S N E C K – valid word.

Option 2: N in position 5 → S _ E _ N
   - Need letters for positions 2 and 4.
   - Possible: S U E C N – not a word; S C E N N – not a word.

SNACK seems like the best next guess:
- S N E C K fits pattern S _ E _ _, uses N in position 2, and tests C and K which are new letters.
- All letters used (S, N, E, C, K) are either confirmed or untested, and none are banned.

Let’s go with SNACK.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. Fixed letters  
   - Position 1: S (✓)  
   - Position 3: E (✓)  

   Word skeleton: S _ E _ _

2. Letters that are definitely in the word (but not yet in the right place)  
   - N (from SPEND and SNACK both marked “-” for N)  
   - K (from SNACK marked “-”)  

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
   A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, C  

4. Therefore the remaining alphabet pool for positions 2 and 4 includes  
   B, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the letter N must appear once (either in position 2 or 4).

5. Possible patterns  
   - If N is in position 2: S N E _ _  → need one more letter for position 4 (must be from allowed set)  
   - If N is in position 4: S _ E N _  → need one more letter for position 2  

6. Candidate words  
   - S N E _ _ :  
     – SNELL – contains L (banned)  
     – SNUG _ – too short  
     – SNEEK – uses K (allowed) but has double E (unknown if valid)

   - S _ E N _ :  
     – SUE N _ – nothing real  
     – SGEN_ – nothing real  
     – SMELN – not a real word  

7. Best valid word left is SNEEK (but double E is risky).  
   However, we still have K unplaced and it must appear somewhere.  
   The only remaining place for K is position 4 in S _ E K _ or position 2 in S K E _ _.  
   SKEL_ is not valid; SKE_ _ with K in position 2 gives SKE_ _ and the only real word is SKELE but that’s 5 letters.  
   SKELE is a valid 5-letter word (archaic for skeleton) and uses K in position 2, E already fixed, and places N where?

Wait, we still need N somewhere and K somewhere.  
The only valid 5-letter word that fits S _ E _ _ with both N and K is:

S N E K _ – too short  
S K E N _ – S K E N T (but T banned)  
S K E N N – not a word  
S N E K Y – not a word  

Realisation: we have to accept that one of N or K must be in position 2 or 4 and the other must fit.  
The only real word left that fits all constraints is SKEEN (an old spelling of “skene” or “sheen”) but that’s obscure.  
A more common word is SNEEK (even with double E) because it places N and K together.

Given the constraints, SNEEK is the only plausible remaining 5-letter word.

From the new feedback on SNEEK:

1. S is still locked in position 1 (✓).
2. E is locked in position 3 (✓).

4. N and K are both in the word but in wrong positions (they were marked “-” twice).
5. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, C.

So the pattern is S _ E E _ and we still need to place N and K in positions 2 and 5 (since position 4 is already E).

Possible arrangements:
- Position 2: N or K

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S N E E K or S K E E N.

2. E is locked in position 3 (✓).
3. The second E in position 4 is also marked ✓, so the word now looks like: S _ E E _
4. N and K are both in the word but in wrong positions (they were marked “-” twice).
5. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, P, D, C.

So the pattern is S _ E E _ and we still need to place N and K in positions 2 and 5 (since position 4 is already E).

Possible arrangements:
- Position 2: N or K
- Position 5: K or N

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S N E E K or S K E E N.

- SNEEK – already tried (feedback confirmed N is not in position 2)
- SKEEN – valid word (archaic but accepted)

Thus the only remaining valid word is SKEEN.",Guess 6: SKEEN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) E(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
