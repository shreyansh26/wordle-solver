For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both common vowels. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so L is somewhere other than position 2
- A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The word contains L but not in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses L in a different position (not 2)
- Avoids S, A, T, E
- Includes other common consonants and vowels (R, I, O, N, C, etc.)

Good candidates: CLING, FLING, BLIND, CRING, etc.  
""CLING"" uses C, L, I, N, G — all common letters not ruled out yet, and places L in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so I’ll try a word that moves L elsewhere.

""FLING"" uses F, L, I, N, G — avoids banned letters and moves L to position 2 again, same issue.  
""BLIND"" uses B, L, I, N, D — L is in position 2 again.  

I need a word where L is NOT in position 2.  
""CLINK"" uses C, L, I, N, K — L in position 2 again.  

""GLINT"" uses G, L, I, N, T — T is banned.  

""PRINT"" uses P, R, I, N, T — T banned.  

""CRONY"" uses C, R, O, N, Y — no L.  

""CLONK"" uses C, L, O, N, K — L in position 2.  

""FLING"" again has L in position 2.  

""BLOND"" uses B, L, O, N, D — L in position 2.  

""PLUNK"" uses P, L, U, N, K — L in position 2.  

""CLUMP"" uses C, L, U, M, P — L in position 2.  

""CLINK"" again.  

Hmm, many common words place L in position 2. Let me think differently: use L in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and avoid banned letters.  

Possible word: ""OLIVE"" — but E is banned.  
""ROILY"" — uses R, O, I, L, Y — L in position 4. This looks good:  
- R, O, I, Y are all allowed

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both common vowels. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so L is somewhere other than position 2
- A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The word contains L but not in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses L in a different position (not 2)
- Avoids S, A, T, E
- Includes other common consonants and vowels (R, I, O, N, C, etc.)

Good candidates: CLING, FLING, BLIND, CRING, etc.  
""CLING"" uses C, L, I, N, G — all common letters not ruled out yet, and places L in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so I’ll try a word that moves L elsewhere.

""FLING"" uses F, L, I, N, G — avoids banned letters and moves L to position 2 again, same issue.  
""BLIND"" uses B, L, I, N, D — L is in position 2 again.  

I need a word where L is NOT in position 2.  
""CLINK"" uses C, L, I, N, K — L in position 2 again.  

""GLINT"" uses G, L, I, N, T — T is banned.  

""PRINT"" uses P, R, I, N, T — T banned.  

""CRONY"" uses C, R, O, N, Y — no L.  

""CLONK"" uses C, L, O, N, K — L in position 2.  

""FLING"" again has L in position 2.  

""BLOND"" uses B, L, O, N, D — L in position 2.  

""PLUNK"" uses P, L, U, N, K — L in position 2.  

""CLUMP"" uses C, L, U, M, P — L in position 2.  

""CLINK"" again.  

Hmm, many common words place L in position 2. Let me think differently: use L in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and avoid banned letters.  

Possible word: ""OLIVE"" — but E is banned.  
""ROILY"" — uses R, O, I, L, Y — L in position 4. This looks good:  
- R, O, I, Y are all allowed  
- L is in position 4 (not 2)  
- No banned letters (S, A, T, E)  

""ROILY"" fits all constraints.

3. Positions ruled out:
   - L cannot be in positions 2 or 4

From the feedback on PROWL:
- P is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓) — position 2
- O is in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓) — position 3
- W is in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓) — position 4
- L is in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓) — position 5

So the word is: _ R O W L

We just need to find the first letter. The remaining letters must not include any of the banned ones: S, A, T, E, I, Y, P.

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, X, Z

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both common vowels. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so L is somewhere other than position 2
- A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The word contains L but not in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses L in a different position (not 2)
- Avoids S, A, T, E
- Includes other common consonants and vowels (R, I, O, N, C, etc.)

Good candidates: CLING, FLING, BLIND, CRING, etc.  
""CLING"" uses C, L, I, N, G — all common letters not ruled out yet, and places L in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so I’ll try a word that moves L elsewhere.

""FLING"" uses F, L, I, N, G — avoids banned letters and moves L to position 2 again, same issue.  
""BLIND"" uses B, L, I, N, D — L is in position 2 again.  

I need a word where L is NOT in position 2.  
""CLINK"" uses C, L, I, N, K — L in position 2 again.  

""GLINT"" uses G, L, I, N, T — T is banned.  

""PRINT"" uses P, R, I, N, T — T banned.  

""CRONY"" uses C, R, O, N, Y — no L.  

""CLONK"" uses C, L, O, N, K — L in position 2.  

""FLING"" again has L in position 2.  

""BLOND"" uses B, L, O, N, D — L in position 2.  

""PLUNK"" uses P, L, U, N, K — L in position 2.  

""CLUMP"" uses C, L, U, M, P — L in position 2.  

""CLINK"" again.  

Hmm, many common words place L in position 2. Let me think differently: use L in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and avoid banned letters.  

Possible word: ""OLIVE"" — but E is banned.  
""ROILY"" — uses R, O, I, L, Y — L in position 4. This looks good:  
- R, O, I, Y are all allowed  
- L is in position 4 (not 2)  
- No banned letters (S, A, T, E)  

""ROILY"" fits all constraints.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROILY:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so R is NOT in position 1
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so O is NOT in position 2
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so L is NOT in position 4
- Y is NOT in the word (x)

Summary of constraints so far:
1. Letters known to be in the word: L, R, O
2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, E, I, Y
3. Positions ruled out:
   - L cannot be in positions 2 or 4
   - R cannot be in position 1
   - O cannot be in position 2

Next guess should:
- Use L, R, O (since they're confirmed present)
- Avoid S, A, T, E, I, Y
- Place L in positions 1, 3, or 5
- Place R somewhere other than position 1
- Place O somewhere other than position 2

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for a word with L, R, O and other allowed letters:
- ""ROLLS"" – has S (banned)
- ""CORNY"" – has Y (banned)
- ""GROIN"" – has I (banned)
- ""FORGE"" – has E (banned)
- ""CROOK"" – has O but also K (allowed)
- ""CROWD"" – has D (allowed)
- ""GROAN"" – has A (banned)
- ""GROWN"" – has W, N (allowed)
- ""GROOM"" – has M (allowed)
- ""GROOF"" – has F (allowed)

""GROWN"" seems good:
- Uses G, R, O, W, N
- Contains confirmed letters R, O (and L isn't used here – need to include L)
  
Wait, must include L, R, O.

Better option: ""CROOL"" – but has O twice and L at end, but O is confirmed present once.

""FLOOR"" – has F, L, O, O, R – uses L and R, but O twice (unknown if O appears twice).

""ROLLS"" – has S (banned).

""ROLL"" – too short.

""CLONK"" – has L, O, N, K, C – but missing R.

""PLONK"" – same issue.

""FORGO"" – has F, O, R, G, O – uses L? No.

""FORGE"" – has E (banned).

""FORGO"" – no L.

""PROLO"" – not a valid word.

""PROWL"" – has P, R, O, W, L – this uses L, R, O and allowed letters:
- P, R, O, W, L – none are banned except positions:
   - L is in position 5 (allowed)
   - R is in position 2 (allowed, since R only can't be in 1)
   - O is in position 3 (allowed, since O only can't be in 2)

""PROWL"" seems valid.

Check:
- P, R, O, W, L – none are banned

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. \n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I\'ll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both common vowels.
