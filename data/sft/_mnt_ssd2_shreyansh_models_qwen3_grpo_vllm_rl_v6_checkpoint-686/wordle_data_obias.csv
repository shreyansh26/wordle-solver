- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
- DOES contain A, but A is not in position 3.

Letters still allowed: all except C, R, N, E.
We know A is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not 3).
2. Use other common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M, D, etc.).
3. Avoid C, R, N, E.

From the two guesses so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

2. STOMA → S(-) T(x) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   - Eliminates: T, M  
   - A exists but is not in positions 3 or 5.  
   - S and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, O  
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, M  
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in 1 or 2.  
- S and O must appear somewhere else (positions not 1 and 2 respectively).

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, Y.

A good next guess should:
- Place A in position 1 or 2.  
- Place S and O in new positions.  
- Use new common letters.

Candidate: ""SOAKS"" – but K is less common and repeats S.  
Better: ""PAUSE"" – but E is eliminated.  
Another: ""SOAPY"" – but Y is less common.  
Best: ""SALOP"" – but P is less common.  
Simpler: ""SALAD"" – but D is okay.  
Wait, A must be in 1 or 2. Try ""ASIDE"" – but E is eliminated.  
Try ""ASIDE"" → invalid (E).  
Try ""ASPIR"" – R is eliminated.  
Try ""ASSAY"" – Y is okay, but double S.  
Try ""ASIDE"" again – invalid.  
Try ""SALAD"" – D is okay, positions: S(1), A(2), L(3), A(4), D(5). But A is in 2 and 4 – feedback would show two A marks.

""SOAKS"" – S(-) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-) – K is bad.

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   Eliminated: C, R, N, E  
   A exists but is not in position 3.

2. STOMA → S(-) T(x) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   Eliminated: T, M  
   A exists but is not in positions 3 or 5.  
   S and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

3. HALOS → H(x) A(-) L(x) O(-) S(✓)  
   Eliminated: H, L  
   A exists but is not in position 2.  
   O is in the word but is not in position 4.  
   S is in position 5 and is correct.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, S, O  
- Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, M, H, L  
- S is locked in position 5.  
- A must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2, 3, 5).  
- O must be in position 2 or 3 (cannot be 4, 1, 5).

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, I, K, P, U, Y, W.

We need a word that:
- Ends with S (position 5).  
- Contains A in 1 or 4.  
- Contains O in 2 or 3.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try A in position 4 and O in position 2:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
- DOES contain A, but A is not in position 3.

Letters still allowed: all except C, R, N, E.
We know A is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not 3).
2. Use other common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M, D, etc.).
3. Avoid C, R, N, E.

A good candidate is ""STOMA"":
- S, T, O, M are still possible.
- A is in position 5 (different from position 3 in CRANE).

Guess 2: STOMA -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) M(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - Eliminates: C, R, N, E  
   - A exists but is not in position 3.

2. STOMA → S(-) T(x) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   - Eliminates: T, M  
   - A exists but is not in positions 3 or 5.  
   - S and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, O  
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, M  
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in 1 or 2.  
- S and O must appear somewhere else (positions not 1 and 2 respectively).

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, Y.

A good next guess should:
- Place A in position 1 or 2.  
- Place S and O in new positions.  
- Use new common letters.

Candidate: ""SOAKS"" – but K is less common and repeats S.  
Better: ""PAUSE"" – but E is eliminated.  
Another: ""SOAPY"" – but Y is less common.  
Best: ""SALOP"" – but P is less common.  
Simpler: ""SALAD"" – but D is okay.  
Wait, A must be in 1 or 2. Try ""ASIDE"" – but E is eliminated.  
Try ""ASIDE"" → invalid (E).  
Try ""ASPIR"" – R is eliminated.  
Try ""ASSAY"" – Y is okay, but double S.  
Try ""ASIDE"" again – invalid.  
Try ""SALAD"" – D is okay, positions: S(1), A(2), L(3), A(4), D(5). But A is in 2 and 4 – feedback would show two A marks.  
We need single A.  

Best simple word: ""SALSA"" – but double S and A.  
""SALSA"" → S(-) A(-) L(x) S(-) A(-) – not helpful.  

""SOAKS"" – S(-) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-) – K is bad.  

""GLASS"" – G, L, A, S, S – double S, L not tested yet.  

""PLAID"" – P, L, A, I, D. Positions: A(3) – but A cannot be 3.  

""PAVIL"" – V, I, L – not common.  

""HALOS"" – H, A, L, O, S. Positions: A(2), O(4), S(5).  
- A in 2 – allowed.  
- O in 4 – allowed (was in 3 in STOMA).  
- S in 5 – allowed (was in 1 in STOMA).  
- H, L new letters.  

""HALOS"" seems good.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
- DOES contain A, but A is not in position 3.

Letters still allowed: all except C, R, N, E.
We know A is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not 3).
2. Use other common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M, D, etc.).
3. Avoid C, R, N, E.

A good candidate is ""STOMA"":
- S, T, O, M are still possible.
- A is in position 5 (different from position 3 in CRANE).

From the two guesses so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - Eliminates: C, R, N, E  
   - A exists but is not in position 3.

2. STOMA → S(-) T(x) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   - Eliminates: T, M  
   - A exists but is not in positions 3 or 5.  
   - S and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, O  
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, M  
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in 1 or 2.  
- S and O must appear somewhere else (positions not 1 and 2 respectively).

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, Y.

A good next guess should:
- Place A in position 1 or 2.  
- Place S and O in new positions.  
- Use new common letters.

Candidate: ""SOAKS"" – but K is less common and repeats S.  
Better: ""PAUSE"" – but E is eliminated.  
Another: ""SOAPY"" – but Y is less common.  
Best: ""SALOP"" – but P is less common.  
Simpler: ""SALAD"" – but D is okay.  
Wait, A must be in 1 or 2. Try ""ASIDE"" – but E is eliminated.  
Try ""ASIDE"" → invalid (E).  
Try ""ASPIR"" – R is eliminated.  
Try ""ASSAY"" – Y is okay, but double S.  
Try ""ASIDE"" again – invalid.  
Try ""SALAD"" – D is okay, positions: S(1), A(2), L(3), A(4), D(5). But A is in 2 and 4 – feedback would show two A marks.  
We need single A.  

Best simple word: ""SALSA"" – but double S and A.  
""SALSA"" → S(-) A(-) L(x) S(-) A(-) – not helpful.  

""SOAKS"" – S(-) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-) – K is bad.  

""GLASS"" – G, L, A, S, S – double S, L not tested yet.  

""PLAID"" – P, L, A, I, D. Positions: A(3) – but A cannot be 3.  

""PAVIL"" – V, I, L – not common.  

""HALOS"" – H, A, L, O, S. Positions: A(2), O(4), S(5).  
- A in 2 – allowed.  
- O in 4 – allowed (was in 3 in STOMA).  
- S in 5 – allowed (was in 1 in STOMA).  
- H, L new letters.  

""HALOS"" seems good.

Current constraints:

- Contains O and B.  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1 or 3.  
- B cannot be in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, T, M, H, L, G.

Remaining possible letters: D, F, I, K, P, U, Y, plus B, O, A, S.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ A S (O in 1)  
- _ O _ A S (O in 3)  

Check O _ _ A S:
- Position 2: must be B (since B must be in word).  
- Position 3: must be from remaining letters (D, F, I, K, P, U, Y).  
Possible: O B D A S – ""OBDAS"" – not a word.  
O B I A S – ""OBIAS"" – no.  
O B P A S – no.  

Check _ O _ A S:
- Position 1: must be B (since B must be in word).  
- Position 3: must be from remaining letters.  
Possible: B O D A S – ""BODAS"" – valid (plural of boda).  
B O I A S – no.  
B O P A S – no.  

""BODAS"" fits all constraints:
- Ends with AS (positions 4-5 ✓).  
- Contains O and B.  
- O in 2 (allowed, since O was in 2 in BOGAS and feedback said O(-) meaning it’s in word but wrong position; in BOGAS O was in 2, so now it must be elsewhere. Wait, this is critical.)

Re-examining BOGAS feedback:
- B(-): B is in word but not in position 1.  
- O(-): O is in word but not in position 2.  
- G(x): G not in word.  
- A(✓): A in position 4.  
- S(✓): S in position 5.

So:
- O must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is A), so O must be in 1 or 3.  
- B must be in 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is A), so B must be in 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ A S (O in 1)  
- _ O _ A S (O in 3)  

For O _ _ A S:
- B must be in 2 or 3.  
- Position 2: B  
- Position 3: from remaining letters (D, F, I, K, P, U, Y).  
Possible: O B D A S – ""OBDAS"" – no.  
O B I A S – no.  

For _ O _ A S:
- B must be in 2 or 3.  
- Position 2: cannot be B (since O is in 3).  
- So B must be in 3, but position 3 is O.  
Wait, this is conflicting.

Let’s list valid positions:
Word structure: [1][2][3][4][5]  
Known: [4]=A, [5]=S.  
O must be in 1 or 3.  
B must be in 2 or 3.  

Case 1: O in 1, B in 2  
Structure: O B _ A S  
Position 3: must be from remaining letters (D, F, I, K, P, U, Y).  
Possible: O B D A S – ""OBDAS"" – no.  
O B I A S – no.  
O B P A S – no.  

Case 2: O in 1, B in 3  
Structure: O _ B A S  
Position 2: from remaining letters.  
Possible: O D B A S – ""ODBAS"" – no.  

Case 3: O in 3, B in 2  
Structure: _ B O A S  
Position 1: from remaining letters.  
Possible: D B O A S – ""DBOAS"" – no.  
F B O A S – no.  
I B O A S – no.  

Case 4: O in 3, B in 3 – impossible, same position.

Wait, we missed another possibility: B in 2 and O in 1, but we tried that.

Actually, let’s list all valid combinations systematically:

Possible positions for O: 1 or 3  
Possible positions for B: 2 or 3 (but not overlapping with O)

If O is in 1:
- B must be in 2 or 3.  
  - If B is in 2: O B _ A S → position 3 must be filled with remaining letters.  
    Remaining letters: D, F, I, K, P, U, Y.  
    Possible words: OBDAS, OBIAS, OBPAS – none are valid.  
  - If B is in 3: O _ B A S → position 2 must be filled.  
    Possible: OD B A S – ""ODBAS"" – no.  
    OI B A S – ""OIBAS"" – no.  

If O is in 3:
- B must be in 2.  
  - Structure: _ B O A S  
  - Position 1: from remaining letters.  
    Possible: D B O A S – ""DBOAS"" – no.  
    F B O A S – ""FBOAS"" – no.  
    I B O A S – ""IBOAS"" – no.  
    K B O A S – no.  

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. This suggests we might need to consider less common words or re-examine constraints.

Wait, let’s check ""VOGAS"" – but G is eliminated.  
""FOGAS"" – G eliminated.  

Re-examining: we have A in 4, S in 5, must include O and B, and only allowed letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, O, A, S, plus D, F, I, K, P, U, Y.

Valid English word fitting constraints: ""BOGAS"" was invalid (G), but ""BOIAS"" – no.  

Wait, ""PODAS"" – no.  

Actually, ""BODAS"" is valid (plural of boda in some contexts) and fits:
- B in 1 – but feedback says B(-) in BOGAS, meaning B is in word but not in 1. So B cannot be in 1.  

Thus, ""BODAS"" is invalid because B would be in 1.  

Next possible: ""FOIAS"" – no.  

""IBODAS"" – too long.  

""YODAS"" – no.  

""UDAS"" – too short.  

This seems problematic. Let’s try ""BOIAS"" – no.  

Wait, we missed ""FOGAS"" but G is eliminated.  

Let me list all possible combinations again with correct constraints:

Structure must be:
- [1][2][3]A S  
- O must be in 1 or 3  
- B must be in 2 or 3 (but not same as O)  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, T, M, H, L, G  

Possible:
1. O in 1, B in 2: O B _ A S → position 3 must be from D, F, I, K, P, U, Y.  
   Possible: O B D A S – ""OBDAS"" – no.  
   O B I A S – no.  
   O B P A S – no.  

2. O in 1, B in 3: O _ B A S → position 2 must be from D, F, I, K, P, U, Y.  
   Possible: O D B A S – ""ODBAS"" – no.  
   O I B A S – ""OIBAS"" – no.  

3. O in 3, B in 2: _ B O A S → position 1 must be from D, F, I, K, P, U, Y.  
   Possible: D B O A S – ""DBOAS"" – no.  
   F B O A S – ""FBOAS"" – no.  
   I B O A S – ""IBOAS"" – no.  

4. O in 3, B in 3 – impossible.  

This suggests the only possible word is ""VOGAS"" but G is eliminated.  

Wait, we missed ""PODAS"" – no.  

Actually, ""BOGAS"" was the only close one but G is out.  

Let me think differently: maybe ""FOIAS"" – no.  

Upon reflection, the only valid word fitting all constraints seems to be ""BODAS"", but B cannot be in 1.  

This implies we might have missed a letter or need to consider ""Y"" more carefully.  

""Y"" is still allowed.  

Try: _ B O A S with Y: Y B O A S – ""YBOAS"" – no.  

""FOYAS"" – no.  

This is tricky. Let me check ""BOYAS"" – no.  

""POYAS"" – no.  

After careful consideration, the only plausible word appears to be ""BODAS"", despite B being in position 1, but feedback says B is in word but not in 1.  

This suggests we might need to consider ""ABOAS"" – but A is in 4.  

""ABOAS"" – A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, A in 4, S in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- A in 4 ✓  
- S in 5 ✓  
- O in 3 (allowed, was in 2 in BOGAS)  
- B in 2 (allowed, was in 1 in BOGAS)  
- Letters: A, B, O, S – all allowed.  

""ABOAS"" is a valid English word (though rare, it’s a plural of aboa, a type of bird).  

Thus, ""ABOAS"" fits all constraints.
