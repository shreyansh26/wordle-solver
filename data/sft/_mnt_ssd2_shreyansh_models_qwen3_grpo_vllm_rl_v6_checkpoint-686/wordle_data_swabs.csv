For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E
- ADIEU has A, D, I, E, U

I think ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. The remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, I, E.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is already confirmed, and we don't have E or I).

Possible structure:
- A could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Let me think of words that fit:
- OASTY (but Y is less common)
- SALTY (but we don't know about T or Y yet)
- SCANT (but I is excluded, so SCANT is invalid)
- STAND (but I is excluded, so STAND is invalid)
- SOUND (but we don't know about O, U, N, D)

Looking at common patterns, ""STAND"" is invalid because of I. ""PLANT"" is invalid because of I. ""SLANT"" is invalid because of I.

Another approach: focus on words with A and S in different positions, and common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLASH (but S is repeated, and we don't know if S can be repeated)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- SCAMP (but M and P are less common)
- SPANK (but N and K are less common)

Looking for words with A and S, and common remaining letters:
- SALSA (but S is repeated)
- SALLY (but Y is less common)
- SALON (but O and N are possible)
- SALTY (T and Y are possible)

""SALTY"" seems reasonable:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- A: position 2 (was position 2 before, but feedback says A is in word but wrong position, so position 2 is invalid for A - this is a problem)
- Wait, in RAISE, A was in position 2 and got (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So SALTY has A in position 2 - same as before - which is invalid.

Let me re-evaluate:
A cannot be in position 2.
S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words:
- STAND: invalid (I is excluded)
- SLANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SALTY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALSA: invalid (A in position 2 and S repeated)
- SALLY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALON: A in position 2 - invalid
- SCANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SPANK: invalid (I is excluded)
- STONY: O and N and Y are possible, but no A or S in correct positions
- STAFF: no A
- STASH: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid - was position 4 before)
- STAYS: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid)
- STAND: invalid
- SLATE: E is excluded
- SLANT: I excluded
- SNAIL: I excluded
- SNAKY: I excluded
- SNACK: I excluded
- SNARL: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded

Hmm, seems like many options are blocked. Let me try:
- STOAT: O and T are possible, but no A in correct position
- STOAS: S repeated
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAT: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 5 (valid - was position 4 before)
- STOAT: letters are S,T,O,A,T - but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in word

This is tricky. Let me try:
- STOAS: invalid (S repeated)
- STOAT: possible
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAK: K is possible
- STOAM: M is possible

""STOAT"" seems the closest:
- S: position 1 (was position 4, now new position)
- T: position 2
- O: position 3
- A: position 4 (was position 2, now new position)
- T: position 5 (repeated T)

But repeated letters are possible, though less common. Alternatively:
- STOAK: S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, A in 4, K in 5
- STOAM: M is possible
- STOAR: R excluded
- STOAS: S repeated

""STOAK"" seems better as it uses new letters.

But let me think of other options:
- SPOON: P and N are possible, but no A
- SHANK: H, N, K are possible, but I excluded
- SHAWN: W, N are possible, but I excluded
- SHAKY: Y is possible
- SHALT: T is possible, but L is possible
- SHALT: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, L in 4, T in 5
- This seems good: A in 3 (was 2), S in 1 (was 4), new letters H, L, T

""SHALT"" seems like a strong next guess:
- S: position 1 (was 4, now 1)
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 (was 2, now 3)
- L: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests new letters H, L, T while repositioning A and S.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- A and S are in the word but in wrong positions (A not in 2, S not in 4).
- R, I, E are not in the word.

I’ll try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces common remaining consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E
- ADIEU has A, D, I, E, U

I think ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. The remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, I, E.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is already confirmed, and we don't have E or I).

Possible structure:
- A could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Let me think of words that fit:
- OASTY (but Y is less common)
- SALTY (but we don't know about T or Y yet)
- SCANT (but I is excluded, so SCANT is invalid)
- STAND (but I is excluded, so STAND is invalid)
- SOUND (but we don't know about O, U, N, D)

Looking at common patterns, ""STAND"" is invalid because of I. ""PLANT"" is invalid because of I. ""SLANT"" is invalid because of I.

Another approach: focus on words with A and S in different positions, and common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLASH (but S is repeated, and we don't know if S can be repeated)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- SCAMP (but M and P are less common)
- SPANK (but N and K are less common)

Looking for words with A and S, and common remaining letters:
- SALSA (but S is repeated)
- SALLY (but Y is less common)
- SALON (but O and N are possible)
- SALTY (T and Y are possible)

""SALTY"" seems reasonable:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- A: position 2 (was position 2 before, but feedback says A is in word but wrong position, so position 2 is invalid for A - this is a problem)
- Wait, in RAISE, A was in position 2 and got (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So SALTY has A in position 2 - same as before - which is invalid.

Let me re-evaluate:
A cannot be in position 2.
S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words:
- STAND: invalid (I is excluded)
- SLANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SALTY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALSA: invalid (A in position 2 and S repeated)
- SALLY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALON: A in position 2 - invalid
- SCANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SPANK: invalid (I is excluded)
- STONY: O and N and Y are possible, but no A or S in correct positions
- STAFF: no A
- STASH: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid - was position 4 before)
- STAYS: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid)
- STAND: invalid
- SLATE: E is excluded
- SLANT: I excluded
- SNAIL: I excluded
- SNAKY: I excluded
- SNACK: I excluded
- SNARL: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded

Hmm, seems like many options are blocked. Let me try:
- STOAT: O and T are possible, but no A in correct position
- STOAS: S repeated
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAT: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 5 (valid - was position 4 before)
- STOAT: letters are S,T,O,A,T - but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in word

This is tricky. Let me try:
- STOAS: invalid (S repeated)
- STOAT: possible
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAK: K is possible
- STOAM: M is possible

""STOAT"" seems the closest:
- S: position 1 (was position 4, now new position)
- T: position 2
- O: position 3
- A: position 4 (was position 2, now new position)
- T: position 5 (repeated T)

But repeated letters are possible, though less common. Alternatively:
- STOAK: S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, A in 4, K in 5
- STOAM: M is possible
- STOAR: R excluded
- STOAS: S repeated

""STOAK"" seems better as it uses new letters.

But let me think of other options:
- SPOON: P and N are possible, but no A
- SHANK: H, N, K are possible, but I excluded
- SHAWN: W, N are possible, but I excluded
- SHAKY: Y is possible
- SHALT: T is possible, but L is possible
- SHALT: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, L in 4, T in 5
- This seems good: A in 3 (was 2), S in 1 (was 4), new letters H, L, T

""SHALT"" seems like a strong next guess:
- S: position 1 (was 4, now 1)
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 (was 2, now 3)
- L: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests new letters H, L, T while repositioning A and S.Based on the feedback:
- A and S are in the word but in wrong positions (A not in 2, S not in 4).
- R, I, E are not in the word.

I’ll try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces common remaining consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E
- ADIEU has A, D, I, E, U

I think ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. The remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, I, E.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is already confirmed, and we don't have E or I).

Possible structure:
- A could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Let me think of words that fit:
- OASTY (but Y is less common)
- SALTY (but we don't know about T or Y yet)
- SCANT (but I is excluded, so SCANT is invalid)
- STAND (but I is excluded, so STAND is invalid)
- SOUND (but we don't know about O, U, N, D)

Looking at common patterns, ""STAND"" is invalid because of I. ""PLANT"" is invalid because of I. ""SLANT"" is invalid because of I.

Another approach: focus on words with A and S in different positions, and common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLASH (but S is repeated, and we don't know if S can be repeated)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- SCAMP (but M and P are less common)
- SPANK (but N and K are less common)

Looking for words with A and S, and common remaining letters:
- SALSA (but S is repeated)
- SALLY (but Y is less common)
- SALON (but O and N are possible)
- SALTY (T and Y are possible)

""SALTY"" seems reasonable:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- A: position 2 (was position 2 before, but feedback says A is in word but wrong position, so position 2 is invalid for A - this is a problem)
- Wait, in RAISE, A was in position 2 and got (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So SALTY has A in position 2 - same as before - which is invalid.

Let me re-evaluate:
A cannot be in position 2.
S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words:
- STAND: invalid (I is excluded)
- SLANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SALTY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALSA: invalid (A in position 2 and S repeated)
- SALLY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALON: A in position 2 - invalid
- SCANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SPANK: invalid (I is excluded)
- STONY: O and N and Y are possible, but no A or S in correct positions
- STAFF: no A
- STASH: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid - was position 4 before)
- STAYS: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid)
- STAND: invalid
- SLATE: E is excluded
- SLANT: I excluded
- SNAIL: I excluded
- SNAKY: I excluded
- SNACK: I excluded
- SNARL: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded

Hmm, seems like many options are blocked. Let me try:
- STOAT: O and T are possible, but no A in correct position
- STOAS: S repeated
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAT: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 5 (valid - was position 4 before)
- STOAT: letters are S,T,O,A,T - but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in word

This is tricky. Let me try:
- STOAS: invalid (S repeated)
- STOAT: possible
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAK: K is possible
- STOAM: M is possible

""STOAT"" seems the closest:
- S: position 1 (was position 4, now new position)
- T: position 2
- O: position 3
- A: position 4 (was position 2, now new position)
- T: position 5 (repeated T)

But repeated letters are possible, though less common. Alternatively:
- STOAK: S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, A in 4, K in 5
- STOAM: M is possible
- STOAR: R excluded
- STOAS: S repeated

""STOAK"" seems better as it uses new letters.

But let me think of other options:
- SPOON: P and N are possible, but no A
- SHANK: H, N, K are possible, but I excluded
- SHAWN: W, N are possible, but I excluded
- SHAKY: Y is possible
- SHALT: T is possible, but L is possible
- SHALT: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, L in 4, T in 5
- This seems good: A in 3 (was 2), S in 1 (was 4), new letters H, L, T

""SHALT"" seems like a strong next guess:
- S: position 1 (was 4, now 1)
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 (was 2, now 3)
- L: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests new letters H, L, T while repositioning A and S.Based on the feedback:
- A and S are in the word but in wrong positions (A not in 2, S not in 4).
- R, I, E are not in the word.

I’ll try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces common remaining consonants.

From the feedback on SBAND:
- S: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- B: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)

4. Remaining possible letters for positions 2, 4, 5: F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5 with these letters, ensuring:
- Position 2 cannot be B (since B is in the word but not here)
- B must be in either position 4 or 5

Possible patterns:
- S _ A B _

Looking at common 5-letter words:

- S G A B O
- S K A B O
- S O A B O (but O repeats)

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible positions for B.

Hmm, none of these seem like valid English words. Maybe I need to consider different letters.

Looking back at the remaining possible letters: F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me try:
- S F A K O (but B is required to be in the word)
- S F A G O (but B is required)
- S F A J O (but B is required)

Wait, I realize I'm missing something. The word must contain B, but it's not in position 2. So B must be in position 4 or 5.

Let me think of valid words:

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E
- ADIEU has A, D, I, E, U

I think ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. The remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, I, E.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is already confirmed, and we don't have E or I).

Possible structure:
- A could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Let me think of words that fit:
- OASTY (but Y is less common)
- SALTY (but we don't know about T or Y yet)
- SCANT (but I is excluded, so SCANT is invalid)
- STAND (but I is excluded, so STAND is invalid)
- SOUND (but we don't know about O, U, N, D)

Looking at common patterns, ""STAND"" is invalid because of I. ""PLANT"" is invalid because of I. ""SLANT"" is invalid because of I.

Another approach: focus on words with A and S in different positions, and common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- SLASH (but S is repeated, and we don't know if S can be repeated)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- SCAMP (but M and P are less common)
- SPANK (but N and K are less common)

Looking for words with A and S, and common remaining letters:
- SALSA (but S is repeated)
- SALLY (but Y is less common)
- SALON (but O and N are possible)
- SALTY (T and Y are possible)

""SALTY"" seems reasonable:
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- A: position 2 (was position 2 before, but feedback says A is in word but wrong position, so position 2 is invalid for A - this is a problem)
- Wait, in RAISE, A was in position 2 and got (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So SALTY has A in position 2 - same as before - which is invalid.

Let me re-evaluate:
A cannot be in position 2.
S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let me think of words:
- STAND: invalid (I is excluded)
- SLANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SALTY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALSA: invalid (A in position 2 and S repeated)
- SALLY: invalid (A in position 2)
- SALON: A in position 2 - invalid
- SCANT: invalid (I is excluded)
- SPANK: invalid (I is excluded)
- STONY: O and N and Y are possible, but no A or S in correct positions
- STAFF: no A
- STASH: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid - was position 4 before)
- STAYS: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 4 (invalid)
- STAND: invalid
- SLATE: E is excluded
- SLANT: I excluded
- SNAIL: I excluded
- SNAKY: I excluded
- SNACK: I excluded
- SNARL: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded
- SNARF: I excluded

Hmm, seems like many options are blocked. Let me try:
- STOAT: O and T are possible, but no A in correct position
- STOAS: S repeated
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAT: A in position 3 (valid), S in position 5 (valid - was position 4 before)
- STOAT: letters are S,T,O,A,T - but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in word

This is tricky. Let me try:
- STOAS: invalid (S repeated)
- STOAT: possible
- STOAE: E excluded
- STOAK: K is possible
- STOAM: M is possible

""STOAT"" seems the closest:
- S: position 1 (was position 4, now new position)
- T: position 2
- O: position 3
- A: position 4 (was position 2, now new position)
- T: position 5 (repeated T)

But repeated letters are possible, though less common. Alternatively:
- STOAK: S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, A in 4, K in 5
- STOAM: M is possible
- STOAR: R excluded
- STOAS: S repeated

""STOAK"" seems better as it uses new letters.

But let me think of other options:
- SPOON: P and N are possible, but no A
- SHANK: H, N, K are possible, but I excluded
- SHAWN: W, N are possible, but I excluded
- SHAKY: Y is possible
- SHALT: T is possible, but L is possible
- SHALT: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, L in 4, T in 5
- This seems good: A in 3 (was 2), S in 1 (was 4), new letters H, L, T

""SHALT"" seems like a strong next guess:
- S: position 1 (was 4, now 1)
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 (was 2, now 3)
- L: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests new letters H, L, T while repositioning A and S.Based on the feedback:
- A and S are in the word but in wrong positions (A not in 2, S not in 4).
- R, I, E are not in the word.

I’ll try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces common remaining consonants.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5 with these letters, ensuring we don't repeat any letters already confirmed (S and A are already used once each).

Possible structure: S _ A _ _

Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with S and having A in the third position, using only the allowed letters.

Some candidates:
- SCAMP (C, M, P are allowed)
- SCANS (N, S - but S is already used in position 1, so can't repeat)
- SCAUP (U, P are allowed)
- SCAFF (F, F - but F would be repeated)
- SCARF (R is excluded)
- SACKS (K, S - S repeats)
- SAGAS (G, S - S repeats)
- SABIN (B, I - I is excluded)
- SABLE (B, E - E is excluded)
- SAPPY (P, Y are allowed)
- SCAMP seems good: S C A M P - all letters allowed (C, M, P not excluded)

Let me check SCAMP:
- S: position 1 (matches ✓)
- C: new letter
- A: position 3 (matches ✓)
- M: new letter
- P: new letter

No conflicts with previous feedback.Based on the updated feedback:
- S is correctly placed at position 1
- A is correctly placed at position 3
- Letters R, I, E, H, L, T are not in the word

I'll try SCAMP as it uses only allowed letters and fits the known pattern S _ A _ _.

From the latest feedback on SCAMP:
- S: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- C: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 3)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So we now know:
1. The word is S _ A _ _
2. The letters not in the word so far: R, I, E, H, L, T, C, M, P
3. Remaining possible letters for positions 2, 4, 5: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5 with these letters, ensuring no repeats of already confirmed letters (S and A are only once each).

Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with S and having A in the third position, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S B A N D (B, N, D allowed)
- S B A B Y (B, Y allowed but B repeats)
- S B A R F (R excluded)
- S D A N C (C excluded)
- S F A U C (C excluded)
- S G A U N (G, U, N allowed)
- S K A U T (T excluded)
- S N A K Y (N, K, Y allowed)
- S O A K Y (O, K, Y allowed)
- S U A V E (E excluded)

The best candidates seem:
- S B A N D
- S G A U N
- S N A K Y
- S O A K Y

Let me check S B A N D:
- S: position 1 (✓)
- B: allowed
- A: position 3 (✓)
- N: allowed
- D: allowed
This fits all constraints.

Another good option is S N A K Y, but let's try S B A N D first as it's a common word.Based on the updated constraints:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Forbidden letters: R, I, E, H, L, T, C, M, P
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I'll try S B A N D.

From the feedback on SBAND:
- S: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- B: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)

So we now know:
1. The word is S _ A _ _
2. B is in the word but not in position 2.
3. Letters not in the word so far: R, I, E, H, L, T, C, M, P, N, D
4. Remaining possible letters for positions 2, 4, 5: F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5 with these letters, ensuring:
- Position 2 cannot be B (since B is in the word but not here)
- B must be in either position 4 or 5

Possible patterns:
- S _ A B _
- S _ A _ B

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- S F A B O (but O is allowed)
- S G A B O
- S K A B O
- S O A B O (but O repeats)
- S U A B O
- S V A B O
- S W A B O
- S Y A B O

But we need to check if these are valid words. Let me think of real words:
- S B A F K (but B is in position 2 which is invalid)
- S F A B O (not a common word)
- S K A B O (not a common word)
- S G A B O (not a common word)

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible positions for B.

Since B must be in position 4 or 5, let's consider:
- S _ A B _
- S _ A _ B

Possible words:
- S F A B O (not a valid word)
- S K A B O (not a valid word)
- S G A B O (not a valid word)
- S O A B O (invalid)
- S U A B O (invalid)
- S V A B O (invalid)
- S W A B O (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem like valid English words. Maybe I need to consider different letters.

Looking back at the remaining possible letters: F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me try:
- S F A K O (but B is required to be in the word)
- S F A G O (but B is required)
- S F A J O (but B is required)

Wait, I realize I'm missing something. The word must contain B, but it's not in position 2. So B must be in position 4 or 5.

Let me think of valid words:
- S B A F K (invalid, B in position 2)
- S F A B O (invalid word)
- S K A B O (invalid word)
- S G A B O (invalid word)

This is tricky. Let me try S K A B O - but this isn't a valid word. 

Wait, let me think differently. The word could be S _ A B _ with the remaining letters.

Possible letters for position 2: F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 5: same list

Let me try S F A B O - but this isn't a valid word. 

Looking at valid English words, the only one that comes to mind is:
- S B A F K (invalid)
- S K A B O (invalid)
- S G A B O (invalid)

Actually, there's a word called ""SABOT"" but T is excluded. 

Wait, let me think of ""SABOT"" - but T is excluded from position 5.

Another word: ""SABER"" - but E is excluded.

""SAUCE"" - but C and E are excluded.

""SAVOR"" - but R is excluded.

""SAVY"" - but needs 5 letters.

""SWAB"" - but needs 5 letters.

""SWABY"" - but Y is allowed.

""SWABY"" seems valid:
- S: position 1 (✓)
- W: allowed
- A: position 3 (✓)
- B: position 4 (allowed, since B must be in word and not in position 2)
- Y: allowed

This fits all constraints. Let me check:
- S: ✓
- W: allowed
- A: ✓
- B: in word but not in position 2 (here it's in 4)
- Y: allowed

This seems correct.Based on the updated constraints:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- B must be in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in 4 or 5)
- Forbidden letters: R, I, E, H, L, T, C, M, P, N, D

The word ""SWABY"" fits:
- S(✓) W A B(✓) Y

- W: ✓ (correct in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 3)
- B: ✓ (correct in position 4)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So the word is now fully determined except for the last letter:
S W A B _

The only remaining position is 5. We know:
- Letters already confirmed: S, W, A, B
- Letters never in the word: R, I, E, H, L, T, C, M, P, N, D, Y
- Remaining possible letters for position 5: F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, X, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words ending with one of these letters:
- SWABF – not a word
- SWABG – not a word
- SWABJ – not a word
- SWABK – not a word
- SWABO – not a word
- SWABQ – not a word
- SWABU – not a word
- SWABV – not a word
- SWABX – not a word
- SWABZ – not a word

Wait, let me double-check. The only valid English word that fits S W A B _ is ""SWAB"" plus a letter, but ""SWAB"" itself is 4 letters. However, ""SWABS"" is 5 letters and valid:
- S W A B S

Let me verify:
- S: position 1 (✓)
- W: position 2 (✓)
- A: position 3 (✓)
- B: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S was only marked as ""not in position 4"" earlier, and position 5 is new)

This fits all constraints.

The word is now S W A B _. The only remaining letter needed is S, forming ""SWABS"".
