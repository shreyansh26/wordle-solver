### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out (x):  
A, R, E, P, N, T, M, C

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
O (position 2 locked), I, S

Positions we still need to place:  
- S must appear, but not in position 3 (from MOSIC feedback) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  
  So S can only be in position 1 or 5.

- I must appear, but not in position 3 (from POINT feedback) and not in position 4 (from MOSIC).  
  So I can be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
  However, position 2 is already O, so I must be in position 1 or 5.

Word skeleton so far:  
_ O _ _ _  (O fixed in position 2)

Case 1: S in position 1 and I in position 5  
  Pattern: S O _ _ I

Case 2: S in position 5 and I in position 1  
  Pattern: I O _ _ S

Let’s pick Case 1 first because it uses more common remaining consonants.

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from the allowed set:  
Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- O is not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in AROSE).
- S is not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in AROSE).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both O and S.
2. Excludes A, R, E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Includes O and S (S is at position 5, O is at position 2 - both new positions).
- Excludes A, R, E.
- Uses common consonants P, N, T to gather more info.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, E are out.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)  
   – P, N, T are out.  
   – O is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O is locked in position 2)
- Must contain S (not in position 4) and I (not in position 3).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, N, T.
- Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- S somewhere (positions 1, 3, 5).
- I somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, 5), but not position 3.
- No A, R, E, P, N, T.

Let’s try a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common remaining letters.  
“MOSIC” comes to mind:
- M, S, I, C are all allowed.  
- O is in position 2.  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

From the latest feedback:

SOLID → S(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-) D(x)

1. S is now confirmed in position 1.
2. O is confirmed in position 2.
3. L is in the word but not in position 3.
4. I is in the word but not in position 4.
5. D is not in the word.

So the pattern is: S O _ _ _

Letters we know must appear: L and I.

Positions left to fill: 3, 4, 5.

Constraints:
- L cannot be in position 3 → L must be in 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 → I must be in 3 or 5.

Possible arrangements:
- If L is in 4: S O _ L _
  Then I must be in 3 or 5. But position 5 is open, so S O I L _ or S O _ L I.
- If L is in 5: S O _ _ L
  Then I must be in 3 → S O I _ L (since 4 is open and I can't be there).

Let's explore these:

1. S O I L _ : Need a letter for position 5 from allowed set (excluding ruled-out letters: A,R,E,P,N,T,M,C,D).
   Allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   Common ones: B, F, G, H, K.

   Possible words: SOILB, SOILF, SOILG, SOILH, SOILK. SOILB and SOILF are not words. SOILG is not a word. SOILH is not a word. SOILK is not a word. None of these are valid.

2. S O _ L I : Need a letter for position 3 from allowed set. Possible letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   Common ones: B, F, G, H, K.

   Possible words: S O B L I, S O F L I, S O G L I, S O H L I, S O K L I.
   Checking these, SOBIL is not a word, SOFLI is not a word, SOGLI is not a word, SOHLI is not a word, SOKLI is not a word.

3. S O I _ L : Need a letter for position 4 from allowed set. Possible letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   Common ones: B, F, G, H, K.

   Possible words: S O I B L, S O I F L, S O I G L, S O I H L, S O I K L.
   Checking these, SOIBL is not a word, SOIFL is not a word, SOIGL is not a word, SOIHL is not a word, SOIKL is not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid 5-letter words. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Alternative approach: Let's list all possible 5-letter words that fit S O _ _ _ with L and I in the remaining positions, considering constraints.

The word must be S O _ _ _, and must contain both L and I in positions 3,4,5 with the given constraints.

Possible permutations:
- L in 4, I in 5: S O _ L I
- L in 5, I in 3: S O I _ L

Looking at S O _ L I:
Need a valid letter for position 3. From allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
Looking for valid 5-letter words: S O ? L I
Possible: S O B L I - no, S O F L I - no, S O G L I - no, S O H L I - no, S O K L I - no. Not finding any.

Looking at S O I _ L:
Need a valid letter for position 4. From allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
Looking for valid 5-letter words: S O I ? L
Possible: S O I B L - no, S O I F L - no, S O I G L - no, S O I H L - no, S O I K L - no.

Wait, maybe I missed some letters or combinations. Let me double-check.

Another angle: Maybe the word is S O I L ? but L is already placed in 4, so position 5 would need to be a letter from allowed set. S O I L ? - possible letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. Looking for valid words: SOILB - no, SOILF - no, SOILG - no, SOILH - no, SOILK - no.

Alternatively, maybe the word is S O ? I L - but then L would be in 5, I in 4, but I cannot be in 4 (from feedback: I is in word but not in position 4). So this is invalid.

Wait, from feedback: I is in the word but not in position 4. So I can be in 3 or 5.

Similarly, L is in word but not in position 3, so L can be in 4 or 5.

Let me list all possible permutations of positions 3,4,5 with letters L and I and one more letter from allowed set.

Possible distributions:
1. S O I L ? : need position 5 from allowed letters. Possible: S O I L B, S O I L F, S O I L G, S O I L H, S O I L K. None are valid words.
2. S O ? I L : need position 3 from allowed letters. Possible: S O B I L, S O F I L, S O G I L, S O H I L, S O K I L. Checking these:
   - SOBIL - no
   - SOFIL - no
   - SOGIL - no
   - SOHIL - no
   - SOKIL - no
3. S O ? L I : need position 3 from allowed letters. Possible: S O B L I - no, S O F L I - no, S O G L I - no, S O H L I - no, S O K L I - no.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that the word might have another letter besides S,O,L,I. But from feedback, we know the word must contain S,O,L,I and one more letter from remaining allowed letters.

Wait, the word is 5 letters and must contain S,O,L,I. That's 4 letters, so the fifth letter must be one of the allowed letters.

Looking back at allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let me try to form words with S O _ _ _ and containing L and I in positions 3,4,5.

Possible word: S O B I L - no
Possible word: S O F I L - no
Possible word: S O G I L - no
Possible word: S O H I L - no
Possible word: S O K I L - no
Possible word: S O I L B - no
Possible word: S O I L F - no
Possible word: S O I L G - no
Possible word: S O I L H - no
Possible word: S O I L K - no
Possible word: S O L I B - no
Possible word: S O L I F - no
Possible word: S O L I G - no
Possible word: S O L I H - no
Possible word: S O L I K - no

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe I missed some letters or combinations.

Wait, let me think of actual 5-letter words that fit S O _ _ _ and contain L and I with the constraints.

Possible word: S O I L Y - but Y is allowed. Let me check:
- S O I L Y: positions S(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5)
- Does this fit constraints?
  - S is in 1 ✓
  - O is in 2 ✓
  - L is in word, not in 3 ✓ (it's in 4)
  - I is in word, not in 4 ✓ (it's in 3)
  - Y is allowed
  - No ruled-out letters
  - Is SOILY a valid word? Yes, it means ""related to or resembling soil.""

So the guess would be SOILY.

  Then I must be in 3 or 5. But position 5 is open, so S O I L _ or S O _ L I.
- If L is in 5: S O _ _ L
  Then I must be in 3 → S O I _ L (since 4 is open and I can't be there).

Let's explore these:

1. S O I L _ : Need a letter for position 5 from allowed set (excluding ruled-out letters: A,R,E,P,N,T,M,C,D).
   Allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   Common ones: B, F, G, H, K.

   Possible words: SOILB, SOILF, SOILG, SOILH, SOILK. SOILB and SOILF are not words. SOILG is not a word. SOILH is not a word. SOILK is not a word. None of these are valid.

2. S O _ L I : Need a letter for position 3 from allowed set. Possible letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   Common ones: B, F, G, H, K.

   Possible words: S O B L I, S O F L I, S O G L I, S O H L I, S O K L I.
   Checking these, SOBIL is not a word, SOFLI is not a word, SOGLI is not a word, SOHLI is not a word, SOKLI is not a word.

3. S O I _ L : Need a letter for position 4 from allowed set. Possible letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   Common ones: B, F, G, H, K.

   Possible words: S O I B L, S O I F L, S O I G L, S O I H L, S O I K L.
   Checking these, SOIBL is not a word, SOIFL is not a word, SOIGL is not a word, SOIHL is not a word, SOIKL is not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid 5-letter words. Maybe I missed some combinations.

Alternative approach: Let's list all possible 5-letter words that fit S O _ _ _ with L and I in the remaining positions, considering constraints.

The word must be S O _ _ _, and must contain both L and I in positions 3,4,5 with the given constraints.

Possible permutations:
- L in 4, I in 5: S O _ L I
- L in 5, I in 3: S O I _ L

Looking at S O _ L I:
Need a valid letter for position 3. From allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
Looking for valid 5-letter words: S O ? L I
Possible: S O B L I - no, S O F L I - no, S O G L I - no, S O H L I - no, S O K L I - no. Not finding any.

Looking at S O I _ L:
Need a valid letter for position 4. From allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.
Looking for valid 5-letter words: S O I ? L
Possible: S O I B L - no, S O I F L - no, S O I G L - no, S O I H L - no, S O I K L - no.

Wait, maybe I missed some letters or combinations. Let me double-check.

Another angle: Maybe the word is S O I L ? but L is already placed in 4, so position 5 would need to be a letter from allowed set. S O I L ? - possible letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. Looking for valid words: SOILB - no, SOILF - no, SOILG - no, SOILH - no, SOILK - no.

Alternatively, maybe the word is S O ? I L - but then L would be in 5, I in 4, but I cannot be in 4 (from feedback: I is in word but not in position 4). So this is invalid.

Wait, from feedback: I is in the word but not in position 4. So I can be in 3 or 5.

Similarly, L is in word but not in position 3, so L can be in 4 or 5.

Let me list all possible permutations of positions 3,4,5 with letters L and I and one more letter from allowed set.

Possible distributions:
1. S O I L ? : need position 5 from allowed letters. Possible: S O I L B, S O I L F, S O I L G, S O I L H, S O I L K. None are valid words.
2. S O ? I L : need position 3 from allowed letters. Possible: S O B I L, S O F I L, S O G I L, S O H I L, S O K I L. Checking these:
   - SOBIL - no
   - SOFIL - no
   - SOGIL - no
   - SOHIL - no
   - SOKIL - no
3. S O ? L I : need position 3 from allowed letters. Possible: S O B L I - no, S O F L I - no, S O G L I - no, S O H L I - no, S O K L I - no.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that the word might have another letter besides S,O,L,I. But from feedback, we know the word must contain S,O,L,I and one more letter from remaining allowed letters.

Wait, the word is 5 letters and must contain S,O,L,I. That's 4 letters, so the fifth letter must be one of the allowed letters.

Looking back at allowed letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let me try to form words with S O _ _ _ and containing L and I in positions 3,4,5.

Possible word: S O B I L - no
Possible word: S O F I L - no
Possible word: S O G I L - no
Possible word: S O H I L - no
Possible word: S O K I L - no
Possible word: S O I L B - no
Possible word: S O I L F - no
Possible word: S O I L G - no
Possible word: S O I L H - no
Possible word: S O I L K - no
Possible word: S O L I B - no
Possible word: S O L I F - no
Possible word: S O L I G - no
Possible word: S O L I H - no
Possible word: S O L I K - no

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe I missed some letters or combinations.

Wait, let me think of actual 5-letter words that fit S O _ _ _ and contain L and I with the constraints.

Possible word: S O I L Y - but Y is allowed. Let me check:
- S O I L Y: positions S(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5)
- Does this fit constraints?
  - S is in 1 ✓
  - O is in 2 ✓
  - L is in word, not in 3 ✓ (it's in 4)
  - I is in word, not in 4 ✓ (it's in 3)
  - Y is allowed
  - No ruled-out letters
  - Is SOILY a valid word? Yes, it means ""related to or resembling soil.""

So the guess would be SOILY.

<guess>SOILY</guess>",Guess 5: SOILY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) I(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
