### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and will help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

None of the letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a large set of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should pick a word using completely different letters.  
Good candidates use high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tried: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y – none have been used before.
- Contains two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. UNITY → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ Eliminates U, T.  
   ⇒ N and I are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   ⇒ Y is in the word and in the correct (last) position.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains N and I somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they were in UNITY (N not in pos 2, I not in pos 3).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus N and I.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N and I in different positions from before.  
Good candidates:  
- BLIND (but ends in D, not Y)  
- CHINK (ends in K)  
- FLING (ends in G)  
- PLINY (ends in Y, uses P, L, I, N, Y) – positions: P(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5).  
  In UNITY, I was in pos 3 (wrong) and N in pos 2 (wrong). In PLINY, I is in pos 3 again – same as before, so that’s not helpful.  
- LINEN (ends in N)  
- MINCY (ends in Y, uses M, I, N, C, Y) – positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5).  
  Here, I moves from pos 3 to pos 2, N from pos 2 to pos 3 – both are new positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and will help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
None of the letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a large set of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should pick a word using completely different letters.  
Good candidates use high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tried: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y – none have been used before.
- Contains two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y).
This should give fresh information about the presence or absence of these letters.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. UNITY → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ Eliminates U, T.  
   ⇒ N and I are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   ⇒ Y is in the word and in the correct (last) position.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains N and I somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they were in UNITY (N not in pos 2, I not in pos 3).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus N and I.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N and I in different positions from before.  
Good candidates:  
- BLIND (but ends in D, not Y)  
- CHINK (ends in K)  
- FLING (ends in G)  
- PLINY (ends in Y, uses P, L, I, N, Y) – positions: P(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5).  
  In UNITY, I was in pos 3 (wrong) and N in pos 2 (wrong). In PLINY, I is in pos 3 again – same as before, so that’s not helpful.  
- LINEN (ends in N)  
- MINCY (ends in Y, uses M, I, N, C, Y) – positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5).  
  Here, I moves from pos 3 to pos 2, N from pos 2 to pos 3 – both are new positions.  
  MINCY is a valid word (means “small coin” or “tiny amount”).

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Maybe N is actually in position 1. Let’s try N I _ _ Y.

Possible words: N I L D Y – “NILEDY” isn’t valid.  
N I L K Y – “NILKY” isn’t valid.  
N I G G Y – “NIGGY” is valid (though slang).  
N I G G Y – but we don’t know if G is in the word, but it’s allowed.  
N I G G Y – let’s check: N(1), I(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).  
From feedback: N is in the word but not in position 2 (from UNITY) or 3 (from MINCY). Here N is in position 1, which is new.  
I is in position 2 (matches feedback).  
Y is in position 5 (matches feedback).  
Letters used: N, I, G, Y. G is allowed since it hasn’t been eliminated.  
“NIGGY” is a valid word, though informal.

Alternative: N I B B Y – “NIBBY” is valid.  
N I B B Y – N(1), I(2), B(3), B(4), Y(5).  
B hasn’t been eliminated.  
“NIBBY” is valid.

Between “NIGGY” and “NIBBY”, “NIBBY” seems slightly more common.

Let’s go with NIBBY.

- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, C, B  
- Letters still allowed for positions 3 and 4: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two distinct letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 3 and 4.

- N I F F Y  → “NIFFF” – not valid  
- N I G G Y  → “NIGGY” – valid (though informal)

- N I P P Y  → “NIPPY” – valid  
- N I V V Y  → “NIVVY” – not standard  
- N I Z Z Y  → “NIZZY” – not valid  

Among the valid options, “NILLY” and “NIPPY” are the most common.  
“NILLY” uses L twice, which is allowed; “NIPPY” uses P twice.  
Both are equally valid, but “NILLY” is slightly more frequent.

So the next guess is NILLY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and will help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
None of the letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a large set of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should pick a word using completely different letters.  
Good candidates use high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tried: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y – none have been used before.
- Contains two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y).
This should give fresh information about the presence or absence of these letters.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. UNITY → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ Eliminates U, T.  
   ⇒ N and I are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   ⇒ Y is in the word and in the correct (last) position.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains N and I somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they were in UNITY (N not in pos 2, I not in pos 3).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus N and I.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N and I in different positions from before.  
Good candidates:  
- BLIND (but ends in D, not Y)  
- CHINK (ends in K)  
- FLING (ends in G)  
- PLINY (ends in Y, uses P, L, I, N, Y) – positions: P(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5).  
  In UNITY, I was in pos 3 (wrong) and N in pos 2 (wrong). In PLINY, I is in pos 3 again – same as before, so that’s not helpful.  
- LINEN (ends in N)  
- MINCY (ends in Y, uses M, I, N, C, Y) – positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5).  
  Here, I moves from pos 3 to pos 2, N from pos 2 to pos 3 – both are new positions.

Current information:

- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, C  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: I, Y  
  – I is in the word and is now known to be in position 2.  
  – Y is in the word and is known to be in position 5.  
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from UNITY and MINCY).

So the pattern so far is: _ I _ _ Y  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, N

N must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.  
But position 5 is already Y, so N must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try N in position 1: N I _ _ Y  
We need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

Try N I L K Y – “NILKY” isn’t valid.  
Try N I G Y _ – but we need 5 letters.  
Wait, we need two letters between I and Y, with N in position 1 or 4.

Alternative: N in position 4: _ I _ N Y  
We need letters for positions 1 and 3. Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Maybe N is actually in position 1. Let’s try N I _ _ Y.

Possible words: N I L D Y – “NILEDY” isn’t valid.  
N I L K Y – “NILKY” isn’t valid.  
N I G G Y – “NIGGY” is valid (though slang).  
N I G G Y – but we don’t know if G is in the word, but it’s allowed.  
N I G G Y – let’s check: N(1), I(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).  
From feedback: N is in the word but not in position 2 (from UNITY) or 3 (from MINCY). Here N is in position 1, which is new.  
I is in position 2 (matches feedback).  
Y is in position 5 (matches feedback).  
Letters used: N, I, G, Y. G is allowed since it hasn’t been eliminated.  
“NIGGY” is a valid word, though informal.

Alternative: N I B B Y – “NIBBY” is valid.  
N I B B Y – N(1), I(2), B(3), B(4), Y(5).  
B hasn’t been eliminated.  
“NIBBY” is valid.

Between “NIGGY” and “NIBBY”, “NIBBY” seems slightly more common.

Let’s go with NIBBY.

From the four guesses we now know:

- Pattern: N I _ _ Y  
  (N in position 1, I in position 2, Y in position 5)

- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, C, B  
- Letters still allowed for positions 3 and 4: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two distinct letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 3 and 4.  
A quick scan of common 5-letter words matching N I _ _ Y gives:

- N I D D Y  → “NIDDY” – not valid  
- N I F F Y  → “NIFFF” – not valid  
- N I G G Y  → “NIGGY” – valid (though informal)  
- N I L L Y  → “NILLY” – valid  
- N I P P Y  → “NIPPY” – valid  
- N I V V Y  → “NIVVY” – not standard  
- N I Z Z Y  → “NIZZY” – not valid  

Among the valid options, “NILLY” and “NIPPY” are the most common.  
“NILLY” uses L twice, which is allowed; “NIPPY” uses P twice.  
Both are equally valid, but “NILLY” is slightly more frequent.

So the next guess is NILLY.
