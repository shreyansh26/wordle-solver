For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these letters.

One popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x): letter O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): letter S is in the word but not in position 4.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E.
- Letters definitely present: A, S.
- Positions ruled out: A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1 and S somewhere other than position 4.

A good next step is to try to place A and S in new positions while introducing other common consonants. Good candidates to test are letters like T, L, N, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (new position for S, since it was excluded from position 4).
- A is in position 3 (new position for A, since it was excluded from position 1).
- Introduces T, I, N - all common letters not yet tested.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.

2. Contains S, but S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded, and 3 is A).

Let's consider possible words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates are common consonants like C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""CASHY"" - but Y might be less common.
Let's try ""BASAL"" - but L is allowed, and we haven't tested B or L yet.
Let's try ""DASKS"" - but K is allowed, and we haven't tested D or K.
Let's try ""MASSE"" - but E is ruled out.
Let's try ""LASSY"" - but Y is allowed, and we haven't tested L or Y.

Actually, let's think of words with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5.

Possible word: ""BASIN"" - but N is ruled out.
Possible word: ""CASSY"" - but S is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 3, and we haven't tested C or Y.
Possible word: ""DASHY"" - but H is allowed, and we haven't tested D or H.
Possible word: ""GASSY"" - G is allowed, S in position 2, A in position 3, S in position 4 (but S can't be in 4 from first feedback), so this is invalid.
Possible word: ""FASCI"" - but I is ruled out.
Possible word: ""LASSO"" - but O is ruled out.
Possible word: ""PASSE"" - but E is ruled out.
Possible word: ""WASPS"" - but P is allowed, S is in position 5 (allowed), A in position 3, but S is also in position 4 (invalid).
Possible word: ""BASAL"" - L is allowed, S in position 2, A in position 3, and we haven't tested B or L.

""BASAL"" seems valid:
- A is in position 3 (confirmed).
- S is in position 2 (not 1 or 4, so allowed).
- Letters used: B, A, S, A, L. None of R, O, E, T, I, N appear.
- B and L are new letters to test.

Let's go with ""BASAL"".

From the new feedback on BASAL:
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in position 3 (confirmed).
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know it’s not in 1 or 4).
- A(-): the second A (position 4) is in the word but not in that position.
- L(x): L is not in the word.

So we now know:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- S must be in position 5 (since positions 1,2,4 are ruled out for S).
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L.
- Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and A, S already placed).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3.
- S in position 5.
- No letters from the banned list.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ S

Common consonants left to try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- C: C _ A _ S → “CHATS” – but T is banned.
- D: D _ A _ S → “D _ A _ S” – “DAYS” is only 4 letters.
- F: F _ A _ S → “F _ A _ S” – “FARCS” has R banned.
- G: G _ A _ S → “G _ A _ S” – “GASPS” has P but double S is okay? No, we need only one S at position 5.
- H: H _ A _ S → “H _ A _ S” – “HASPS” again double S issue.
- K: K _ A _ S → “K _ A _ S” – “KASPS” same issue.
- M: M _ A _ S → “M _ A _ S” – “MASSE” has E banned.
- P: P _ A _ S → “P _ A _ S” – “PASSE” has E banned.
- W: W _ A _ S → “W _ A _ S” – “WASPS” has P but double S issue.
- Y: Y _ A _ S – not common.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need _ _ A _ S with no banned letters. Let’s list possible combinations:

- C, A, S already used in positions 3 and 5. Need two new consonants for positions 1 and 2 from allowed letters.

Allowed consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try common pairs:
- C and H: CHA _ S – “CHATS” but T banned.
- C and K: CK... no common word.
- C and M: CM... no.
- D and C: DC... no.
- D and K: DK... no.

Hmm, maybe position 4 can also be a new consonant, but we already have S in 5 and A in 3. Let me think of actual words fitting _ _ A _ S with no banned letters.

Possible words:
- “CHAOS” – O banned.
- “PHASE” – E banned.
- “WAGES” – E banned.
- “FACAS” – second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL feedback), and C is allowed.
- “MACAW” – W allowed, but A is in position 3, so “MACAW” doesn’t fit (A in 3, S in 5 required).
- “PACED” – E banned.
- “VACAY” – Y allowed, but A in 3, so “VACAY” doesn’t fit.
- “YACHT” – T banned.
- “ZAPAS” – Z, A, P, A, S – but second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL), and P is allowed. However, ZAPAS has A in 3 and S in 5, and letters Z, A, P, A, S – no banned letters. But is ZAPAS a valid word? It means “taps” in Spanish, but may not be common English.

Another option: “HABAS” – but B is banned.
“GABAS” – B banned.
“KABAS” – B banned.

“FACAS” – F, A, C, A, S. Second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL feedback), but in FACAS, A is in position 4, which is not allowed (feedback says A(-) in position 4). So FACAS is invalid.

“DACHS” – D, A, C, H, S. A in 3, S in 5, no banned letters. Is DACHS a word? It’s a surname, but may not be valid.

“MACHS” – M, A, C, H, S. A in 3, S in 5, no banned letters. MACHS is a valid word (machs is plural of mach, a Scottish monetary unit).

Let me check: M, A, C, H, S – none of R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L appear. A is in 3, S in 5. This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “MACHS”.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these letters.

One popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): letter R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): letter O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): letter S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): letter E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E.
- Letters definitely present: A, S.
- Positions ruled out: A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1 and S somewhere other than position 4.

A good next step is to try to place A and S in new positions while introducing other common consonants. Good candidates to test are letters like T, L, N, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (new position for S, since it was excluded from position 4).
- A is in position 3 (new position for A, since it was excluded from position 1).
- Introduces T, I, N - all common letters not yet tested.

3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded, and 3 is A).

Let's consider possible words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates are common consonants like C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Possible word: ""BASIN"" - but N is ruled out.
Possible word: ""CASSY"" - but S is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 3, and we haven't tested C or Y.
Possible word: ""DASHY"" - but H is allowed, and we haven't tested D or H.
Possible word: ""GASSY"" - G is allowed, S in position 2, A in position 3, S in position 4 (but S can't be in 4 from first feedback), so this is invalid.
Possible word: ""FASCI"" - but I is ruled out.
Possible word: ""LASSO"" - but O is ruled out.
Possible word: ""PASSE"" - but E is ruled out.

Possible word: ""BASAL"" - L is allowed, S in position 2, A in position 3, and we haven't tested B or L.

""BASAL"" seems valid:
- A is in position 3 (confirmed).
- S is in position 2 (not 1 or 4, so allowed).

- W: W _ A _ S → “W _ A _ S” – “WASPS” has P but double S issue.
- Y: Y _ A _ S – not common.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need _ _ A _ S with no banned letters. Let’s list possible combinations:

- C, A, S already used in positions 3 and 5. Need two new consonants for positions 1 and 2 from allowed letters.

Allowed consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try common pairs:
- C and H: CHA _ S – “CHATS” but T banned.
- C and K: CK... no common word.
- C and M: CM... no.
- D and C: DC... no.
- D and K: DK... no.
- F and C: FC... no.
- G and C: GC... no.
- H and C: HC... no.
- K and C: KC... no.
- M and C: MC... no.
- P and C: PC... no.
- W and C: WC... no.
- Y and C: YC... no.

Hmm, maybe position 4 can also be a new consonant, but we already have S in 5 and A in 3. Let me think of actual words fitting _ _ A _ S with no banned letters.

Possible words:
- “CHAOS” – O banned.
- “PHASE” – E banned.
- “WAGES” – E banned.
- “FACAS” – second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL feedback), and C is allowed.
- “MACAW” – W allowed, but A is in position 3, so “MACAW” doesn’t fit (A in 3, S in 5 required).
- “PACED” – E banned.
- “VACAY” – Y allowed, but A in 3, so “VACAY” doesn’t fit.
- “YACHT” – T banned.
- “ZAPAS” – Z, A, P, A, S – but second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL), and P is allowed. However, ZAPAS has A in 3 and S in 5, and letters Z, A, P, A, S – no banned letters. But is ZAPAS a valid word? It means “taps” in Spanish, but may not be common English.

Another option: “HABAS” – but B is banned.
“GABAS” – B banned.
“KABAS” – B banned.

“FACAS” – F, A, C, A, S. Second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL feedback), but in FACAS, A is in position 4, which is not allowed (feedback says A(-) in position 4). So FACAS is invalid.

“DACHS” – D, A, C, H, S. A in 3, S in 5, no banned letters. Is DACHS a word? It’s a surname, but may not be valid.

“MACHS” – M, A, C, H, S. A in 3, S in 5, no banned letters. MACHS is a valid word (machs is plural of mach, a Scottish monetary unit).

Let me check: M, A, C, H, S – none of R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L appear. A is in 3, S in 5. This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “MACHS”.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these letters.

One popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): letter R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): letter O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): letter S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): letter E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E.
- Letters definitely present: A, S.
- Positions ruled out: A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1 and S somewhere other than position 4.

A good next step is to try to place A and S in new positions while introducing other common consonants. Good candidates to test are letters like T, L, N, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (new position for S, since it was excluded from position 4).
- A is in position 3 (new position for A, since it was excluded from position 1).
- Introduces T, I, N - all common letters not yet tested.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.

- A(✓): A is in the word AND in position 3.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters confirmed: A (position 3), S (somewhere, not 1 or 4).
- Letters ruled out: R, O, E, T, I, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 3.
2. Contains S, but S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded, and 3 is A).

Let's consider possible words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ _ A _ S

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates are common consonants like C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""CASHY"" - but Y might be less common.
Let's try ""BASAL"" - but L is allowed, and we haven't tested B or L yet.
Let's try ""DASKS"" - but K is allowed, and we haven't tested D or K.
Let's try ""MASSE"" - but E is ruled out.
Let's try ""LASSY"" - but Y is allowed, and we haven't tested L or Y.

Actually, let's think of words with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5.

Possible word: ""BASIN"" - but N is ruled out.
Possible word: ""CASSY"" - but S is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 3, and we haven't tested C or Y.
Possible word: ""DASHY"" - but H is allowed, and we haven't tested D or H.
Possible word: ""GASSY"" - G is allowed, S in position 2, A in position 3, S in position 4 (but S can't be in 4 from first feedback), so this is invalid.
Possible word: ""FASCI"" - but I is ruled out.
Possible word: ""LASSO"" - but O is ruled out.
Possible word: ""PASSE"" - but E is ruled out.
Possible word: ""WASPS"" - but P is allowed, S is in position 5 (allowed), A in position 3, but S is also in position 4 (invalid).
Possible word: ""BASAL"" - L is allowed, S in position 2, A in position 3, and we haven't tested B or L.

""BASAL"" seems valid:
- A is in position 3 (confirmed).
- S is in position 2 (not 1 or 4, so allowed).
- Letters used: B, A, S, A, L. None of R, O, E, T, I, N appear.
- B and L are new letters to test.

- Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and A, S already placed).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3.
- S in position 5.
- No letters from the banned list.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ S

Common consonants left to try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- C: C _ A _ S → “CHATS” – but T is banned.
- D: D _ A _ S → “D _ A _ S” – “DAYS” is only 4 letters.
- F: F _ A _ S → “F _ A _ S” – “FARCS” has R banned.
- G: G _ A _ S → “G _ A _ S” – “GASPS” has P but double S is okay? No, we need only one S at position 5.
- H: H _ A _ S → “H _ A _ S” – “HASPS” again double S issue.
- K: K _ A _ S → “K _ A _ S” – “KASPS” same issue.
- M: M _ A _ S → “M _ A _ S” – “MASSE” has E banned.
- P: P _ A _ S → “P _ A _ S” – “PASSE” has E banned.
- W: W _ A _ S → “W _ A _ S” – “WASPS” has P but double S issue.
- Y: Y _ A _ S – not common.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need _ _ A _ S with no banned letters. Let’s list possible combinations:

- C, A, S already used in positions 3 and 5. Need two new consonants for positions 1 and 2 from allowed letters.

Allowed consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try common pairs:
- C and H: CHA _ S – “CHATS” but T banned.
- C and K: CK... no common word.
- C and M: CM... no.
- D and C: DC... no.
- D and K: DK... no.
- F and C: FC... no.
- G and C: GC... no.
- H and C: HC... no.
- K and C: KC... no.
- M and C: MC... no.
- P and C: PC... no.
- W and C: WC... no.
- Y and C: YC... no.

Hmm, maybe position 4 can also be a new consonant, but we already have S in 5 and A in 3. Let me think of actual words fitting _ _ A _ S with no banned letters.

Possible words:
- “CHAOS” – O banned.
- “PHASE” – E banned.
- “WAGES” – E banned.
- “FACAS” – second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL feedback), and C is allowed.
- “MACAW” – W allowed, but A is in position 3, so “MACAW” doesn’t fit (A in 3, S in 5 required).
- “PACED” – E banned.
- “VACAY” – Y allowed, but A in 3, so “VACAY” doesn’t fit.
- “YACHT” – T banned.
- “ZAPAS” – Z, A, P, A, S – but second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL), and P is allowed. However, ZAPAS has A in 3 and S in 5, and letters Z, A, P, A, S – no banned letters. But is ZAPAS a valid word? It means “taps” in Spanish, but may not be common English.

Another option: “HABAS” – but B is banned.
“GABAS” – B banned.
“KABAS” – B banned.

“FACAS” – F, A, C, A, S. Second A is not in position 4 (from BASAL feedback), but in FACAS, A is in position 4, which is not allowed (feedback says A(-) in position 4). So FACAS is invalid.

“DACHS” – D, A, C, H, S. A in 3, S in 5, no banned letters. Is DACHS a word? It’s a surname, but may not be valid.

“MACHS” – M, A, C, H, S. A in 3, S in 5, no banned letters. MACHS is a valid word (machs is plural of mach, a Scottish monetary unit).

Let me check: M, A, C, H, S – none of R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L appear. A is in 3, S in 5. This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “MACHS”.

- A(✓): A is in position 3 (confirmed).
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- S(✓): S is in position 5 (confirmed).

So we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: S
- Positions 1, 2, 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Letters definitely absent so far: R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L, M, C, H.

Remaining available consonants (and vowels): D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ A _ S.

Let’s list possible combinations using the remaining letters:

1. D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z for positions 1, 2, 4.

Possible words:
- D, A, G, S → but need 5 letters.
- D, U, A, G, S → ""DUAGS"" – not valid.
- F, U, A, G, S → ""FUAGS"" – not valid.
- G, U, A, G, S – ""GUAGS"" – not valid.
- J, U, A, G, S – ""JUAGS"" – not valid.
- K, U, A, G, S – ""KUAGS"" – not valid.
- P, U, A, G, S – ""PUAGS"" – not valid.
- V, U, A, G, S – ""VUAGS"" – not valid.
- W, U, A, G, S – ""WUAGS"" – not valid.
- Y, U, A, G, S – ""YUAGS"" – not valid.

Let’s try other combinations:

- D, U, A, G, S – ""DUAGS"" – invalid.
- D, A, G, U, S – ""DAGUS"" – this is a valid word (plural of dagga, a type of cannabis).

Check constraints:
- D, A, G, U, S.
- A is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- Letters used: D, A, G, U, S – none of the banned letters (R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L, M, C, H) appear.
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Thus, ""DAGUS"" fits perfectly.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, E, T, I, N, B, L, M, C, H, D, G, U.

Remaining available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the above):
F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form: _ _ A _ S.

Let’s list the few remaining possibilities:

1. F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z for positions 1, 2, 4.

Possible combinations:
- F, J, A, K, S → ""FJAKS"" – invalid.
- F, K, A, J, S → ""FKJAS"" – invalid.
- J, K, A, F, S → ""JKAFS"" – invalid.
- K, F, A, J, S → ""KFAJS"" – invalid.

- V, F, A, J, S → ""VFAJS"" – invalid.
- W, F, A, J, S → ""WFAJS"" – invalid.
- Y, F, A, J, S → ""YFAJS"" – invalid.
- Z, F, A, J, S → ""ZFAJS"" – invalid.

Let me check if any actual English word fits _ _ A _ S with only the remaining letters.

Looking through my mental lexicon:
- ""JACKS"" – J, A, C, K, S – but C is banned.
- ""KAPAS"" – K, A, P, A, S – second A is not allowed (from BASAL feedback).
- ""PAPAS"" – P, A, P, A, S – second A not allowed.
- ""WAFAS"" – W, A, F, A, S – second A not allowed.
- ""YAKIS"" – Y, A, K, I, S – I is banned.
- ""ZAPPY"" – doesn't end with S.
- ""JAZZY"" – doesn't fit.

Wait, let me systematically list all remaining letters for positions 1,2,4:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:     ? ? A ? S

Available letters for 1,2,4: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid word. The only common English word I can think of that fits is:

""JACKS"" – but C is banned.
""KAPAS"" – second A not allowed.
""KAFAS"" – second A not allowed.
""KAPUS"" – U is banned.
""KAPAS"" – already considered.

Actually, let me think of ""KAPAS"" again: K, A, P, A, S. The second A is in position 4, and from BASAL feedback, A(-) means the second A is not in position 4. So ""KAPAS"" is invalid.

Another possibility: ""PAPAS"" – same issue with second A.

""KAZAS"" – second A not allowed.

""KAPAS"" – same.

""KAPUS"" – U banned.

""KAPAS"" – same.

""KAPAS"" – same.

Wait, let me think of ""KAPAS"" again: K, A, P, A, S. The second A is in position 4, and from BASAL feedback, A(-) in position 4 means that A is not in position 4. So ""KAPAS"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""PAPAS"" is invalid.
