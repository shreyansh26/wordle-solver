### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word and their positions. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are also solid choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it balances vowels and consonants well.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E in different positions from before.
- Excludes A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good letters to test next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, etc.

Let me try ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (new position from 4).
- E in position 2 (new position from 5).
- Tests new letters T, I, N.
- No A, R, O.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N, L  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T  

Exact positions known:
- S is fixed in position 1 (✓).

Letters still to place: E, T  
Restrictions:
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because it was marked “-” in positions 2, 3, 5 across the guesses).
- T cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (because it was marked “-” in those positions).

Therefore:
- E must be in position 4 (only remaining slot for E).
- T must be in position 3 (only remaining slot for T).

Current pattern: S _ _ _ _  
Filling in the forced letters: S _ T E _

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has T in position 3 and E in position 4, and does not contain any of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, I, N, L).

Remaining high-frequency letters to try: C, D, U, M, Y, etc.

Candidate words fitting S _ T E _:
- SCUTE (but U and C are allowed, and SCUTE is valid)
- SMOTE (but O is forbidden)
- STONE (O and N are forbidden)
- SCENT (N is forbidden)
- STENT (N is forbidden)
- SCUTE (valid, letters S, C, U, T, E — none forbidden)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word and their positions. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are also solid choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it balances vowels and consonants well.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E in different positions from before.
- Excludes A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good letters to test next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, etc.

Let me try ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (new position from 4).
- E in position 2 (new position from 5).
- Tests new letters T, I, N.
- No A, R, O.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T  
Exact positions so far:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _ with E and T still to place, and no A/R/O/I/N allowed.

Possible remaining high-frequency letters to test: C, L, D, U, M, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place E and T while introducing new common letters.  
A good candidate is “SLEET”:
- S in position 1 (✓).
- L, E, T all new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be 2 or 5).
- T is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be 2).

From all feedback so far we have:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, I, N, L, C, U, K  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
S, E, T  

Exact positions known:  
- Position 1: S (✓)  
- Position 4: T (✓)  

Letters still to place: E  
Allowed positions for E: only position 3 (since positions 2, 5 and earlier placements have been ruled out).

So the pattern is:  
S _ E T _

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits S _ E T _ and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining unused allowed letters include: D, M, P, Y, G, B, F, H, V, W, etc.

Candidate words:  
- SMETE – invalid  
- SPITE – I is forbidden  
- SWEET – W and E are allowed, but E is already placed in position 3  
- SKEET – already tried, K is forbidden  
- SLEET – L is forbidden  
- SWEET – valid, but double E  
- SHETE – invalid  
- SDESK – invalid  

The only valid English word left that fits S _ E T _ and uses allowed letters is SWEET (even though it repeats E, the rules allow repeated letters in guesses as long as the word itself is valid).

Therefore, the final guess is SWEET.
