For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", and ""AUDIO"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, R, S
- Letters we know are in the word: O, E
- O cannot be in position 3, E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Places O somewhere other than position 3
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Good next candidates would be words like:
- OCEAN (but contains A, which is excluded)
- OLENT (but T is not yet tested, and we need more info)
- ONSET (but S is excluded)
- OPIUM (but P and M are untested, and we need more info)

A better approach is to test new common letters while incorporating O and E. Let's try ""OCEAN"" but since A is excluded, let's try ""OCEAN"" minus A → ""OCE"" plus two new letters. However, we need a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""OPIUM"" - but P and M are untested. Let's try ""OPIUM"" to test P, I, U, and see where O and E fit.

But since we know E is in the word, let's try a word that includes E and O, and tests new common letters. ""OCEAN"" is invalid (A excluded). ""OPIUM"" doesn't have E. 

Let's try ""OILED"":
- Contains O and E (in positions 1 and 4)
- Tests I, L, D (new letters)
- O is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed)
- E is in position 4 (not position 5, so allowed)
- Doesn't contain A, R, or S

The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, I, D, U  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, E, L, N, T  

Exact positional constraints:
- O cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from OILED and LOUNT)  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from AROSE and LOUNT)  
- L cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from OILED and LOUNT)  
- N must be in position 4 (from LOUNT)  
- T must be in position 5 (from LOUNT)

So the word looks like: _ _ _ N T  
and it must contain O and E somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, with the remaining letter being L (since we know L is in the word but not yet placed).

Possible placements:
- O and E must occupy positions 1 and 2 or 1 and 3 (since 3 is still open for E, but O is blocked at 3).  
- L must go in the remaining open position among 1, 2, 3.

Let’s enumerate:
1. If O is in position 1, then E must be in position 2 or 3, and L in the remaining slot.
   - O E L N T  → OELNT (invalid, not a word)
   - O L E N T  → OLENT (valid word)

2. If E is in position 1, then O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot), and L must go in position 3.
   - E O L N T  → EOLNT (invalid)

Only valid candidate is OLENT.

Check constraints:
- Contains O, E, L, N, T  
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- E in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  
- N in position 4 (required)  
- T in position 5 (required)  

OLENT is a valid English word meaning “to stretch out.”
