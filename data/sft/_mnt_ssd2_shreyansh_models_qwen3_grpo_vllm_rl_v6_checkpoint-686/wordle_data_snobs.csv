For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (uses 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- SLATE (uses S, L, T and common vowels)
- CRANE (uses C, R, N and common vowels)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
2. Contains N, but N is not in the 4th position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has N somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.

Good letters to try next are common consonants and remaining vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants to try are S, T, L, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STONY"":
- Uses S, T, O, N, Y.
- N is in position 4 (but feedback said N is in the word but not in position 4, so this is actually invalid because STONY has N in position 4).

Let's try ""SNOUT"":
- S, N, O, U, T.
- N is in position 2 (valid since position 4 is excluded).
- Uses O and U as remaining vowels.
- Uses S, N, T as common consonants.

This seems like a good second guess to maximize information gain.

- SNOM_ → SNOMA (valid), SNOMA is a word (meaning a type of tree)
- SNOP_ → SNOPS (valid)
- SNOR_ → SNORR (invalid)

From these, “SNOMA” and “SNOPS” are valid. “SNOMA” uses M and A, but A was eliminated. “SNOPS” uses P and S, but S is already in position 1. 

Wait, let’s re-examine eliminated letters: A is eliminated (from CRANE feedback). So “SNOMA” is invalid due to A. 

Next option: “SNORT” – but T is eliminated. “SNOWS” – W and S eliminated. 

Looking again, perhaps “SNOMA” is invalid, but “SNOM” is a prefix. Let’s think of other endings:

Another valid word: “SNUGS” – but U is eliminated. “SNIPS” – I and P, but I wasn’t tested yet. 

Wait, vowels left: I, O, U, but O is already in position 3. U is eliminated, so remaining vowels for positions 4-5: I, O, but O is used. 

So possible endings with consonants: 

- SNIPS (I and P)
- SNICK (C eliminated)
- SNIDE (E eliminated)
- SNIBS (B and S, but S is already used)

“SNIPS” seems valid: S N O I P. But does it fit the pattern? Let’s check:

SNIPS: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) I(_) P(_). This would test I and P. 

Another option: “SNOMA” invalid (A eliminated), “SNOM” + “P” gives “SNOMPA” which isn’t a word. 

“SNIPS” is a valid word and tests I and P. Let’s go with that.

But wait, does “SNIPS” fit all constraints? Let’s verify:

- Starts with S N O: yes.
- Uses only uneliminated letters: I and P haven’t been tested yet, and aren’t in the eliminated list.
- Valid English word: yes.

Thus, the next logical guess is “SNIPS”.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (uses 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- SLATE (uses S, L, T and common vowels)
- CRANE (uses C, R, N and common vowels)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
2. Contains N, but N is not in the 4th position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has N somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.

Good letters to try next are common consonants and remaining vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants to try are S, T, L, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STONY"":
- Uses S, T, O, N, Y.
- N is in position 4 (but feedback said N is in the word but not in position 4, so this is actually invalid because STONY has N in position 4).

Let's try ""SNOUT"":
- S, N, O, U, T.
- N is in position 2 (valid since position 4 is excluded).
- Uses O and U as remaining vowels.
- Uses S, N, T as common consonants.

This seems like a good second guess to maximize information gain.

Guess 2: SNOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SNOUT → S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)  
   ⇒ S is correct in position 1.  
   ⇒ N is correct in position 2.  
   ⇒ O is correct in position 3.  
   ⇒ U and T are not in the word.

So the secret word pattern so far is:
S N O _ _

Letters already eliminated: C, R, A, E, U, T.

Remaining common consonants to try in positions 4 and 5: D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible endings:  
- “SNOWY” – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and W hasn’t been tested.  
- “SNOD_” – but “SNODE” isn’t a word.  
- “SNOMP” – not a word.  
- “SNOWS” – repeats S, already used.  
- “SNOWY” – valid word, uses W and Y, both untested.

Let’s try “SNOWY”.

If that fails, we can adjust, but it’s a good test of the remaining letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (uses 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- SLATE (uses S, L, T and common vowels)
- CRANE (uses C, R, N and common vowels)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
2. Contains N, but N is not in the 4th position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has N somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.

Good letters to try next are common consonants and remaining vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants to try are S, T, L, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be something like ""STONY"":
- Uses S, T, O, N, Y.
- N is in position 4 (but feedback said N is in the word but not in position 4, so this is actually invalid because STONY has N in position 4).

Let's try ""SNOUT"":
- S, N, O, U, T.
- N is in position 2 (valid since position 4 is excluded).
- Uses O and U as remaining vowels.
- Uses S, N, T as common consonants.

This seems like a good second guess to maximize information gain.

Guess 2: SNOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SNOUT → S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)  
   ⇒ S is correct in position 1.  
   ⇒ N is correct in position 2.  
   ⇒ O is correct in position 3.  
   ⇒ U and T are not in the word.

So the secret word pattern so far is:
S N O _ _

Letters already eliminated: C, R, A, E, U, T.

Remaining common consonants to try in positions 4 and 5: D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible endings:  
- “SNOWY” – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and W hasn’t been tested.  
- “SNOD_” – but “SNODE” isn’t a word.  
- “SNOMP” – not a word.  
- “SNOWS” – repeats S, already used.  
- “SNOWY” – valid word, uses W and Y, both untested.

Let’s try “SNOWY”.

If that fails, we can adjust, but it’s a good test of the remaining letters.

Current confirmed information:

1. Word pattern: S N O _ _
2. Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, E, U, T, W, Y

Remaining common consonants: D, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “SNO” and ends with two letters from the remaining pool. Let’s list possible valid words:

- SNOD_ → SNODE (invalid), SNODS (repeats S)
- SNOM_ → SNOMA (valid), SNOMA is a word (meaning a type of tree)
- SNOP_ → SNOPS (valid)
- SNOR_ → SNORR (invalid)
- SNOW_ → already tried W and Y

From these, “SNOMA” and “SNOPS” are valid. “SNOMA” uses M and A, but A was eliminated. “SNOPS” uses P and S, but S is already in position 1. 

Wait, let’s re-examine eliminated letters: A is eliminated (from CRANE feedback). So “SNOMA” is invalid due to A. 

Next option: “SNORT” – but T is eliminated. “SNOWS” – W and S eliminated. 

Looking again, perhaps “SNOMA” is invalid, but “SNOM” is a prefix. Let’s think of other endings:

- SNODS – invalid (A eliminated)
- SNOMA – invalid (A eliminated)
- SNOPS – valid, uses P and S, but S is already in position 1. 

Another valid word: “SNUGS” – but U is eliminated. “SNIPS” – I and P, but I wasn’t tested yet. 

Wait, vowels left: I, O, U, but O is already in position 3. U is eliminated, so remaining vowels for positions 4-5: I, O, but O is used. 

So possible endings with consonants: 

- SNIPS (I and P)
- SNICK (C eliminated)
- SNIDE (E eliminated)
- SNIBS (B and S, but S is already used)

“SNIPS” seems valid: S N O I P. But does it fit the pattern? Let’s check:

SNIPS: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) I(_) P(_). This would test I and P. 

Another option: “SNOMA” invalid (A eliminated), “SNOM” + “P” gives “SNOMPA” which isn’t a word. 

“SNIPS” is a valid word and tests I and P. Let’s go with that.

But wait, does “SNIPS” fit all constraints? Let’s verify:

- Starts with S N O: yes.
- Uses only uneliminated letters: I and P haven’t been tested yet, and aren’t in the eliminated list.
- Valid English word: yes.

Thus, the next logical guess is “SNIPS”.

We now know:

- Exact pattern: S N O _ S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T, W, Y, I, P

So the fourth letter must be one of the remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, etc.

Valid 5-letter words that start with “SNO” and end with “S”:
- SNODS – invalid (A eliminated, but D is ok, however “SNODS” isn’t a recognized word)
- SNOMS – valid (means to snom, a slang term for “snort”)
- SNOS_ – nothing common fits
- SNOMA – invalid (A eliminated)

“SNOMS” is the only plausible remaining word that fits all constraints.

We now have the pattern locked to:

and we know the fourth letter is NOT any of: C, R, A, E, U, T, W, Y, I, P, M.

Remaining consonants that can slot in position 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, V, etc.

The only common English 5-letter word that fits S N O _ S with one of these consonants is:

S N O D S   →   SNODS

However, “SNODS” is not recognized as a standard English word.  
The next best option is:

S N O G S   →   SNOGS

This is a valid variant spelling (chiefly Scottish for “snogs” – to snort or choke), and the letter G has not been eliminated.

Therefore, “SNOGS” is the logical final guess.
