### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

- Keep R and E in new positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, I, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and E.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: S, L, O, U, D, B, G, H, M, F, Y, W, K.

2. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
4. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no C, A, N, T, I, P).

- _ E R _ _  (E in 2, R in 3)
- _ _ E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ _ E _ R  (E in 3, R in 5)

Looking for common words:
- ""SERFS"" – S and F are new letters, but S is common.
- ""FERNS"" – N is out.
- ""BERRY"" – B, R, R, Y – double R, but R is already known.
- ""DRESS"" – S is new, but S is repeated.
- ""HERSE"" – H, E, R, S, E – E is repeated.
- ""LOWER"" – O, L, O, W, E, R – O is new, L is new, W is new.
  - Check constraints:
    - Contains R and E: yes.
    - R is in position 5 (allowed: not 1 or 2).
    - E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4 from feedback). So ""LOWER"" is invalid.
- ""GLOVE"" – G, L, O, V, E.

- ""DRESS"" – D, R, E, S, S.
  - R is in 2 – invalid.
- ""MERGE"" – M, E, R, G, E.
  - R is in 3 (allowed), E is in 2 and 5 – but E cannot be in 5. Invalid.
- ""FERRY"" – F, E, R, R, Y.
  - E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 and 4 – R in 3 is allowed, but double R is okay.
  - However, E is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed), and no forbidden positions.
  - Also, F, Y are new letters not yet tested.
  - ""FERRY"" fits all constraints.

Let me verify:

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains R and E, but neither is in its current spot (R was 2nd, E was 5th).
2. The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good next word should:
- Keep R and E in new positions.
- Introduce new common letters.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Possible candidates:
- STERE (but E is repeated and might not help)
- TRIPE (T, R, I, P, E - uses R and E in new spots, introduces T, I, P)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E - uses R and E, introduces D, I, V)
- ROUSE (R, O, U, S, E - uses R and E, introduces O, U, S)

I'll choose ""TRIPE"" as it introduces T, I, P - all common letters not yet tested, and moves R and E to new positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (CRANE):
- C, A, N are out.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Round 2 (TRIPE):
- T, I, P are out.
- R is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known) and now also NOT in position 1.
- E is still in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known) and now also NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, I, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and E.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: S, L, O, U, D, B, G, H, M, F, Y, W, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
4. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no C, A, N, T, I, P).

Let’s try to construct such a word:
- E _ _ R _  (E in 1, R in 4)
- E _ R _ _  (E in 1, R in 3)
- _ E _ R _  (E in 2, R in 4)
- _ E R _ _  (E in 2, R in 3)
- _ _ E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ _ E _ R  (E in 3, R in 5)

Looking for common words:
- ""SERFS"" – S and F are new letters, but S is common.
- ""FERNS"" – N is out.
- ""BERRY"" – B, R, R, Y – double R, but R is already known.
- ""DRESS"" – S is new, but S is repeated.
- ""HERSE"" – H, E, R, S, E – E is repeated.
- ""LOWER"" – O, L, O, W, E, R – O is new, L is new, W is new.
  - Check constraints:
    - Contains R and E: yes.
    - R is in position 5 (allowed: not 1 or 2).
    - E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4 from feedback). So ""LOWER"" is invalid.
- ""GLOVE"" – G, L, O, V, E.
  - Contains E but not R – invalid.
- ""SHRED"" – S, H, R, E, D.
  - E is in position 4 – invalid.
- ""FRESH"" – F, R, E, S, H.
  - E is in position 3 (allowed), R is in position 2 – but R cannot be in 2. Invalid.
- ""DRESS"" – D, R, E, S, S.
  - R is in 2 – invalid.
- ""MERGE"" – M, E, R, G, E.
  - R is in 3 (allowed), E is in 2 and 5 – but E cannot be in 5. Invalid.
- ""FERRY"" – F, E, R, R, Y.
  - E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 and 4 – R in 3 is allowed, but double R is okay.
  - However, E is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed), and no forbidden positions.
  - Also, F, Y are new letters not yet tested.
  - ""FERRY"" fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- F, E, R, R, Y.
- Letters used: F, E, R, Y – all from remaining pool (no C, A, N, T, I, P).
- R is in position 3 (allowed: not 1 or 2).
- E is in position 2 (allowed: not 4 or 5).
- It’s a valid English word.

Therefore, ""FERRY"" is a good next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Round 1 (CRANE):
- C, A, N are out.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Round 2 (TRIPE):
- T, I, P are out.
- R is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it’s not in 2).
- E is still in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5.

Round 3 (FERRY):
- F, Y are out.
- E is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- The two R’s received “-” feedback, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 either.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: E (fixed at position 2), R.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, N, T, I, P, F, Y.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
  That leaves only position 5 for R.

So the word must be of the form: _ E _ _ R  
and must use only letters from the remaining pool: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, S, U, W, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit _ E _ _ R:
- BESOR – not a valid word.
- DEXER – X not allowed (not yet tested, but we should stick to common letters).
- GELOR – not a word.
- HEMER – not a word.
- LEXER – X not allowed.
- MEXER – X not allowed.
- OCEAN – A is out.
- SEDER – not common.
- SEMER – not a word.
- SHEER – double E is okay, but we already have E in position 2.
- SOWER – O, W are allowed.
- SOWER fits perfectly: S O W E R  
  – positions: S(1) O(3) W(4) E(2) R(5)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are OUT (never appear):  
C, A, N, T, I, P, F, Y, S, O, W

Letters that ARE in the word:  
- E (but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5)  
- R (and now we know it IS in position 5, because the last guess SOWER gave R(✓) at the 5th spot)

So the word must be: _ _ _ _ R  
with E somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 are excluded for E).

Possible patterns:  
E _ _ _ R  (E in 1)  
_ _ E _ R  (E in 3)

Letters still available (from the alphabet minus the eliminated ones):  
B, D, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, U, V)

Let’s list common 5-letter words ending in R that contain E in position 1 or 3:

- E _ _ _ R:  
  – EDGER (but D, G allowed)  
  – ELVER (E, L, V allowed)  
  – EMERG (not a word)  
  – EAGER (A is out)  
  – EMPTY (P is out)  

- _ _ E _ R:  
  – B E E P R (invalid, P is out)  
  – B L E N D R (too long)  
  – D E E P R (P is out)  
  – H E L V R (not a word)  
  – M E L V R (not a word)  
  – B L E N D (no)  
  – Actually, we need 5-letter words:  
    – B L E N D (no)  
    – B L E A K (A out)  
    – B L E N D (no)  
    – B L E N D (no)  

Wait, let’s systematically look for valid 5-letter words ending in R with E in 1 or 3:

Valid candidates:  
- EDGER (E1, D, G, E, R) – but E appears twice, and we don’t know if E is duplicated.  
- ELVER (E1, L, V, E, R) – E twice again.  
- EMERG (invalid)  
- EBBER (E1, B, B, E, R) – E twice.  
- EBBER (invalid)  
- EBBER (invalid)  

Actually, let’s check dictionary for 5-letter words ending in R with E in 1 or 3:

- EDGER – valid, E in 1, R in 5, letters E, D, G, E, R → E appears twice.  
- ELVER – valid, E in 1, R in 5, letters E, L, V, E, R → E appears twice.  
- EBBER – valid, E in 1, R in 5, letters E, B, B, E, R → E appears twice.  
- EAGER – invalid (A out)  
- EIDER – invalid (D is okay, but E in 1, R in 5, letters E, I, D, E, R → I is out)  

From these, EDGER and ELVER seem the most plausible. Both fit the constraints.  
Between them, EDGER uses D and G (both allowed) and has no repeated letters beyond the known E. ELVER uses L and V, also allowed.  

Let’s pick EDGER because it introduces two new letters (D and G) and keeps it simple.

So the next guess is EDGER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains R and E, but neither is in its current spot (R was 2nd, E was 5th).
2. The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good next word should:
- Keep R and E in new positions.
- Introduce new common letters.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Possible candidates:
- STERE (but E is repeated and might not help)
- TRIPE (T, R, I, P, E - uses R and E in new spots, introduces T, I, P)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E - uses R and E, introduces D, I, V)
- ROUSE (R, O, U, S, E - uses R and E, introduces O, U, S)

I'll choose ""TRIPE"" as it introduces T, I, P - all common letters not yet tested, and moves R and E to new positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (CRANE):
- C, A, N are out.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Round 2 (TRIPE):
- T, I, P are out.
- R is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known) and now also NOT in position 1.
- E is still in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known) and now also NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, I, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and E.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: S, L, O, U, D, B, G, H, M, F, Y, W, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
4. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no C, A, N, T, I, P).

Let’s try to construct such a word:
- E _ _ R _  (E in 1, R in 4)
- E _ R _ _  (E in 1, R in 3)
- _ E _ R _  (E in 2, R in 4)
- _ E R _ _  (E in 2, R in 3)
- _ _ E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ _ E _ R  (E in 3, R in 5)

Looking for common words:
- ""SERFS"" – S and F are new letters, but S is common.
- ""FERNS"" – N is out.
- ""BERRY"" – B, R, R, Y – double R, but R is already known.
- ""DRESS"" – S is new, but S is repeated.
- ""HERSE"" – H, E, R, S, E – E is repeated.
- ""LOWER"" – O, L, O, W, E, R – O is new, L is new, W is new.
  - Check constraints:
    - Contains R and E: yes.
    - R is in position 5 (allowed: not 1 or 2).
    - E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4 from feedback). So ""LOWER"" is invalid.
- ""GLOVE"" – G, L, O, V, E.
  - Contains E but not R – invalid.
- ""SHRED"" – S, H, R, E, D.
  - E is in position 4 – invalid.
- ""FRESH"" – F, R, E, S, H.
  - E is in position 3 (allowed), R is in position 2 – but R cannot be in 2. Invalid.
- ""DRESS"" – D, R, E, S, S.
  - R is in 2 – invalid.
- ""MERGE"" – M, E, R, G, E.
  - R is in 3 (allowed), E is in 2 and 5 – but E cannot be in 5. Invalid.
- ""FERRY"" – F, E, R, R, Y.
  - E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 and 4 – R in 3 is allowed, but double R is okay.
  - However, E is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed), and no forbidden positions.
  - Also, F, Y are new letters not yet tested.
  - ""FERRY"" fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- F, E, R, R, Y.
- Letters used: F, E, R, Y – all from remaining pool (no C, A, N, T, I, P).
- R is in position 3 (allowed: not 1 or 2).
- E is in position 2 (allowed: not 4 or 5).
- It’s a valid English word.

Therefore, ""FERRY"" is a good next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Round 1 (CRANE):
- C, A, N are out.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Round 2 (TRIPE):
- T, I, P are out.
- R is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it’s not in 2).
- E is still in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5.

Round 3 (FERRY):
- F, Y are out.
- E is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- The two R’s received “-” feedback, so R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 either.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: E (fixed at position 2), R.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, N, T, I, P, F, Y.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
  That leaves only position 5 for R.

So the word must be of the form: _ E _ _ R  
and must use only letters from the remaining pool: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, S, U, W, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit _ E _ _ R:
- BESOR – not a valid word.
- DEXER – X not allowed (not yet tested, but we should stick to common letters).
- GELOR – not a word.
- HEMER – not a word.
- LEXER – X not allowed.
- MEXER – X not allowed.
- OCEAN – A is out.
- SEDER – not common.
- SEMER – not a word.
- SHEER – double E is okay, but we already have E in position 2.
- SOWER – O, W are allowed.
- SOWER fits perfectly: S O W E R  
  – positions: S(1) O(3) W(4) E(2) R(5)  
  – R is in position 5 (allowed).  
  – All letters S, O, W are new and not yet eliminated.

Therefore, “SOWER” is a valid next guess.

Letters still available (from the alphabet minus the eliminated ones):  
B, D, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, U, V)

Let’s list common 5-letter words ending in R that contain E in position 1 or 3:

- E _ _ _ R:  
  – EDGER (but D, G allowed)  
  – ELVER (E, L, V allowed)  
  – EMERG (not a word)  
  – EAGER (A is out)  
  – EMPTY (P is out)  

- _ _ E _ R:  
  – B E E P R (invalid, P is out)  
  – B L E N D R (too long)  
  – D E E P R (P is out)  
  – H E L V R (not a word)  
  – M E L V R (not a word)  
  – B L E N D (no)  
  – Actually, we need 5-letter words:  
    – B L E N D (no)  
    – B L E A K (A out)  
    – B L E N D (no)  
    – B L E N D (no)  

Wait, let’s systematically look for valid 5-letter words ending in R with E in 1 or 3:

Valid candidates:  
- EDGER (E1, D, G, E, R) – but E appears twice, and we don’t know if E is duplicated.  
- ELVER (E1, L, V, E, R) – E twice again.  
- EMERG (invalid)  
- EBBER (E1, B, B, E, R) – E twice.  
- EBBER (invalid)  
- EBBER (invalid)  

Actually, let’s check dictionary for 5-letter words ending in R with E in 1 or 3:

- EDGER – valid, E in 1, R in 5, letters E, D, G, E, R → E appears twice.  
- ELVER – valid, E in 1, R in 5, letters E, L, V, E, R → E appears twice.  
- EBBER – valid, E in 1, R in 5, letters E, B, B, E, R → E appears twice.  
- EAGER – invalid (A out)  
- EIDER – invalid (D is okay, but E in 1, R in 5, letters E, I, D, E, R → I is out)  

From these, EDGER and ELVER seem the most plausible. Both fit the constraints.  
Between them, EDGER uses D and G (both allowed) and has no repeated letters beyond the known E. ELVER uses L and V, also allowed.  

Let’s pick EDGER because it introduces two new letters (D and G) and keeps it simple.

So the next guess is EDGER.

Let’s update the state after the fifth guess.

Eliminated letters (x feedback):

Confirmed letters and positions:  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (because it got “-” in positions 1, 2, 4 and we already knew it was “-” in 5 before).  
  That leaves only position 3 for E.

So the word must be: _ _ E _ R

Available letters (not yet eliminated):  
B, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z  (common ones: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, V)

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ _ E _ R using these letters.
