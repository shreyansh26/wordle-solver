For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- S is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and E, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.
2. The word does not contain A, R, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes O and E.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.
- Excludes A, R, S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining consonants and keeps O and E in new positions. A good candidate is ""OCEAN"", but A is excluded. ""OFTEN"" uses F and T and keeps O and E in new spots. However, ""OFTEN"" has E in position 5, which is invalid. 

Another option is ""TONEY"":
- T, N, Y are common consonants.
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- No A, R, S.

This seems valid.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- S is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and E, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.
2. The word does not contain A, R, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes O and E.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.
- Excludes A, R, S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining consonants and keeps O and E in new positions. A good candidate is ""OCEAN"", but A is excluded. ""OFTEN"" uses F and T and keeps O and E in new spots. However, ""OFTEN"" has E in position 5, which is invalid. 

Another option is ""TONEY"":
- T, N, Y are common consonants.
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- No A, R, S.

This seems valid.

We now know the exact pattern: _ O N E Y  
Positions 2–5 are locked in as O, N, E, Y respectively.  
Letters already ruled out for position 1: A, R, S, T, M, H.  

Remaining consonants that have not been tried and are common:  
B, C, D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, etc.

Valid 5-letter English words ending in “ON EY” with a single consonant at the start:
- BONEY  
- CONEY  
- DONEY (not a word)  
- FONEY (not a word)  
- GONEY (not a word)  
- LONEY (not a word)  
- PONEY (not a word)  
- WONEY (not a word)  

The only real candidates are BONEY and CONEY. CONEY has not been tried yet, so we’ll go with that.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". \n\nI\'ll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word\n- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words\n- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A and R are NOT in the word (x).\n- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).\n- S is NOT in the word (x).\n\nSo we know:\n1.

A good candidate is ""OCEAN"", but A is excluded. ""OFTEN"" uses F and T and keeps O and E in new spots.
