### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

2. The word contains E and we now know it is in position 3 (because in TREND the E was marked ✓).
3. The letters A, O, S, T, N, D are NOT in the word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts
1. Position 2 is R (✓ in every guess).
2. Position 3 must be E (✓ in TREND).
3. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, T, N, D, P, I, M.
4. Therefore the pattern is: _ R E _ _ with the remaining alphabet still available containing B, C, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Goal
Find two new letters (positions 1 and 4) from the still-allowed set, and one final letter for position 5, also still allowed, to form a valid English word.

Candidate letters left (common ones first): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? R E ? ? using only letters not yet excluded.

Possible words that fit:
- B R E A K → A is excluded.
- C R E E K → double E, but E already placed once; K allowed.
- F R E S H → S excluded.
- G R E E N → N excluded.
- C R E P E → P excluded.
- B R E W S → S excluded.
- C R E P E → P excluded.
- F R E E R → R already in position 2, but R can appear again; however double R is uncommon.
- B R E W Y → Y allowed.
- C R E W S → S excluded.
- G R E W Y → Y allowed.
- F R E E K → K allowed.
- C R E E K → K allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in the 2nd position
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So far we know:
- 2nd letter is R
- The word contains E somewhere (but not in 5th position)
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or S

We need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Has E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)
3. Avoids A, O, S
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information

A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- R is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 3 (different from 5th position in AROSE, so possible)
- Uses T, N, D which are common consonants
- Avoids A, O, S

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

3. The letters A, O, S, T, N, D are NOT in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ R E _ _

We still need to find:
- 1st letter (not A, T)
- 4th letter (not E, N, D, S, O)
- 5th letter (not E, A, O, S, T, N, D)

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already placed)

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and E in position 3
- Uses common remaining letters
- Avoids all excluded letters

A good candidate is ""FRESH"":
- F (1st), R (2nd), E (3rd), S (4th), H (5th)
- But S is already known to be absent (from AROSE feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CREPT"":
- C, R, E, P, T
- T is excluded (from TREND feedback), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""BREAD"":
- A is excluded, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""GREED"":
- D is excluded, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""PRIME"":
- P, R, I, M, E
- This fits all constraints: R in 2nd, E in 3rd, avoids all excluded letters.

2. The word contains E and we now know it is in position 3 (because in TREND the E was marked ✓).
3. The letters A, O, S, T, N, D are NOT in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ R E _ _

We still need to find:
- 1st letter (not A, T)
- 4th letter (not E, N, D, S, O)
- 5th letter (not E, A, O, S, T, N, D)

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already placed)

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and E in position 3
- Uses common remaining letters
- Avoids all excluded letters

A good candidate is ""FRESH"":
- F (1st), R (2nd), E (3rd), S (4th), H (5th)
- But S is already known to be absent (from AROSE feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CREPT"":
- C, R, E, P, T
- T is excluded (from TREND feedback), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""BREAD"":
- A is excluded, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""GREED"":
- D is excluded, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""PRIME"":
- P, R, I, M, E
- This fits all constraints: R in 2nd, E in 3rd, avoids all excluded letters.

Let’s go with ""PRIME"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts
1. Position 2 is R (✓ in every guess).
2. Position 3 must be E (✓ in TREND).
3. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, T, N, D, P, I, M.
4. Therefore the pattern is: _ R E _ _ with the remaining alphabet still available containing B, C, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Goal
Find two new letters (positions 1 and 4) from the still-allowed set, and one final letter for position 5, also still allowed, to form a valid English word.

Candidate letters left (common ones first): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? R E ? ? using only letters not yet excluded.

Possible words that fit:
- B R E A K → A is excluded.
- C R E E K → double E, but E already placed once; K allowed.
- F R E S H → S excluded.
- G R E E N → N excluded.
- C R E P E → P excluded.
- B R E W S → S excluded.
- C R E P E → P excluded.
- F R E E R → R already in position 2, but R can appear again; however double R is uncommon.
- B R E W Y → Y allowed.
- C R E W S → S excluded.
- G R E W Y → Y allowed.
- F R E E K → K allowed.
- C R E E K → K allowed.

Among these, “CREAK” is invalid (A excluded), “FRESH” invalid (S excluded), “GREEN” invalid (N excluded).  
“CREEK” uses only allowed letters (C, R, E, K) and is a valid word.

Let’s try CREEK.

From the four guesses we now have the following facts:

1. Position 2 is R (✓ in every guess).
2. Position 3 is E (✓ in TREND and CREEK).
3. Position 4 is E (✓ in CREEK).
4. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, T, N, D, P, I, M, C, K.

So the pattern is: _ R E E _ with the remaining alphabet still containing B, F, G, H, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? R E E ? using only letters not yet excluded.

Possible letters for position 1 and 5: B, F, G, H, L, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid English words:
- B R E E D → D is excluded.
- B R E E Z → Z is not yet excluded, but ""BREED"" is 5 letters, ""BREEDZ"" is invalid.
- F R E E D → D excluded.
- G R E E N → N excluded.
- H R E E D → D excluded.
- L R E E ? → No common words.
- W R E E D → D excluded.
- B R E E N → N excluded.
- F R E E K → K excluded.
- B R E E K → K excluded.

The only remaining common word that fits is ""BREED"" but D is excluded.  
Looking again, ""FLEET"" is invalid (T excluded).  
""FRESH"" invalid (S excluded).  

Wait, let's list remaining letters: B, F, G, H, L, U, V, W, Y.

Valid words:
- B R E E Z → not a word.
- F R E E R → R already in position 2, but ""FREER"" is valid (comparative of free).
- W R E E D → D excluded.
- G R E E T → T excluded.
- H R E E D → D excluded.

""FREER"" uses only allowed letters (F, R, E, R) and is a valid word.

Let’s try FREER.
