### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters in English. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Some excellent strategic starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E somewhere other than the last position.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s aim for a word that covers fresh common letters while respecting the constraints. A strong candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are new letters.
- E is included but moved to the 4th position (so it’s not in the 5th slot).

This should give us maximal new information.

From the new feedback on HEMID:
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
- M, I, D are not in the word at all.

So the secret word so far looks like:
H E _ _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word (from all previous feedback):
S, L, A, T, C, O, R, M, I, D

Remaining common letters to try: N, G, B, F, K, U, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with HE  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out  
- The third, fourth, and fifth letters must come from the remaining pool

Looking at common endings for HE___:
- HENNY (but N and Y are allowed, but double N might be less common)
- HAPPY (P is allowed, but A is ruled out)
- HERON (O and R are ruled out)
- HEWED (W, E, D - but D is ruled out)
- HEGUM (G, U, M - M is ruled out)
- HEBEK (K is allowed, but B, K are less common)

A strong candidate is ""HENNY"":
- Starts with HE  
- Uses N and Y which are still allowed  
- Double N is acceptable in English  
- All letters are from the allowed set

Another good option is ""HEWED"", but D is ruled out.  
""HEAPP"" is invalid (A is out).  
""HEFED"" is invalid (D is out).  

""HENNY"" seems the best among these.
