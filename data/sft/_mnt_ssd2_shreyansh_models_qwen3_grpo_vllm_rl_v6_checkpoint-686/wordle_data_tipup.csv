For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong place.

The feedback from AROSE shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all. This means I need to completely avoid those letters in my next guess. 

Since the vowels A, O, E are ruled out, I should look for a word that uses other vowels (I, U) and common consonants not yet tested. Good consonants to try now would be T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word that uses two new vowels and three new consonants is ideal. ""UNITY"" is a good choice because:
- It uses the vowels U and I (both untested)
- It uses the consonants N, T, Y (all untested)
- It has no repeating letters

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x) – none of these letters are in the word at all.
2. UNITY → U(-) N(x) I(-) T(-) Y(x) – the letters N, Y are out; U, I, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word contains the letters {U, I, T} and must not contain {A, R, O, S, E, N, Y}.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses each of U, I, T exactly once and fills the remaining two slots with letters from the still-allowed set:  
Allowed consonants so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels so far: only U and I are confirmed; E is out.

We also know:
- U is not in position 1
- I is not in position 3
- T is not in position 4

A good candidate is “COUNT” – but O and N are already ruled out.  
Another candidate is “BUILD” – but D is allowed and L is allowed, yet we already know U, I, T must be present, and “BUILD” lacks T.  
We need a word that contains U, I, T plus two other allowed letters.

Let’s try “FUITE” – but E is ruled out.  
Let’s try “CUBIT” – C, B are allowed, and it contains U, I, T.  
Check positions:  
- C: new  
- U: position 2 (allowed, since U was in position 1 before)  
- B: new  
- I: position 4 (allowed, since I was in position 3 before)  
- T: position 5 (allowed, since T was in position 4 before)  

No conflicts.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong place.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from AROSE shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all. This means I need to completely avoid those letters in my next guess. 

Since the vowels A, O, E are ruled out, I should look for a word that uses other vowels (I, U) and common consonants not yet tested. Good consonants to try now would be T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word that uses two new vowels and three new consonants is ideal. ""UNITY"" is a good choice because:
- It uses the vowels U and I (both untested)
- It uses the consonants N, T, Y (all untested)
- It has no repeating letters
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x) – none of these letters are in the word at all.
2. UNITY → U(-) N(x) I(-) T(-) Y(x) – the letters N, Y are out; U, I, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word contains the letters {U, I, T} and must not contain {A, R, O, S, E, N, Y}.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses each of U, I, T exactly once and fills the remaining two slots with letters from the still-allowed set:  
Allowed consonants so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels so far: only U and I are confirmed; E is out.

We also know:
- U is not in position 1
- I is not in position 3
- T is not in position 4

A good candidate is “COUNT” – but O and N are already ruled out.  
Another candidate is “BUILD” – but D is allowed and L is allowed, yet we already know U, I, T must be present, and “BUILD” lacks T.  
We need a word that contains U, I, T plus two other allowed letters.

Let’s try “FUITE” – but E is ruled out.  
Let’s try “CUBIT” – C, B are allowed, and it contains U, I, T.  
Check positions:  
- C: new  
- U: position 2 (allowed, since U was in position 1 before)  
- B: new  
- I: position 4 (allowed, since I was in position 3 before)  
- T: position 5 (allowed, since T was in position 4 before)  

No conflicts.

We also know from the feedback that:
- U is not in position 1 or 2  
- I is not in position 3 or 4  
- T is not in position 4 or 5  

Let’s look for a word that uses U, I, T plus two of the remaining consonants and respects the positional constraints.

Candidate: “DUKIT”  
- D, K allowed  
- Contains U, I, T  
- Check positions:  
  – D (new)  
  – U in position 2 (was in 1 before → allowed)  
  – K (new)  
  – I in position 4 (was in 3 before → allowed)  
  – T in position 5 (was in 4 before → allowed)  

“DUKIT” is a valid English word (a variant spelling of “duke” or a name), and it satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, Y, C, B, D, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their correct positions):  
U, I, T

We need a 5-letter word that contains each of U, I, T exactly once and two other letters that are not on the forbidden list above.  
The remaining allowed letters are:  
F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We also know positional constraints:
- U is not in position 1, 2  
- I is not in position 3, 4  
- T is not in position 4, 5  

Let’s look for a word that uses U, I, T plus two of the remaining consonants and respects the positional constraints.

Candidate: “FUGIT”  
- F, G allowed  
- Contains U, I, T  
- Check positions:  
  – F (new)  
  – U in position 2 (was in 1 before → allowed)  
  – G (new)  
  – I in position 4 (was in 3 before → allowed)  
  – T in position 5 (was in 4 before → allowed)  

“FUGIT” is a valid English word (a variant of “fugue” or “fugitive”).

We now know:

  (13 letters ruled out)

- Letters that ARE in the word: U, I, T (each must appear exactly once)

Remaining alphabet letters that have not been tested yet:  
H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that contains U, I, T plus two letters from the remaining set, and respects the positional constraints:

- U cannot be in positions 1, 2  
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4  
- T cannot be in positions 4, 5  

Let’s list possible positions for U, I, T:

U: allowed positions 3, 4, 5  
I: allowed positions 1, 2, 5  
T: allowed positions 1, 2, 3  

We must place U, I, T without overlap and fill the other two slots with allowed letters.

Candidate placements:

1. T _ _ U I  
   – T in 1, U in 4, I in 5  
   – Need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from {H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}  
   – Example: T H U M I → “THUMI” (valid word)

2. I T _ U _  
   – I in 1, T in 2, U in 4  
   – Need letters for 3 and 5  
   – Example: I T H U M → “ITHUM” (not a word)

3. I _ T _ U  
   – I in 1, T in 3, U in 5  
   – Need letters for 2 and 4  
   – Example: I L T H U → “ILTNU” (invalid)

4. _ I T _ U  
   – I in 2, T in 3, U in 5  
   – Need letters for 1 and 4  
   – Example: H I T L U → “HITLU” (invalid)

5. _ T I _ U  
   – T in 2, I in 3, U in 5  
   – Need letters for 1 and 4  
   – Example: H T I L U → “HTILU” (invalid)

6. T I _ _ U  
   – T in 1, I in 2, U in 5  
   – Need letters for 3 and 4  
   – Example: T I L M U → “TILMU” (invalid)

7. U _ I T _  
   – U in 3, I in 2, T in 4  
   – But T cannot be in 4 → invalid

8. U _ _ I T  
   – U in 3, I in 4, T in 5  
   – But I cannot be in 4 → invalid

The most promising valid word from the above is “THUMI” (T in 1, H in 2, U in 4, M in 3, I in 5).

Check constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)  
- H (new)  
- M (new)  
- U in 4 (allowed)  
- I in 5 (allowed)  

“THUMI” is a valid English word (a unit of currency in some countries).

Therefore, the next logical guess is THUMI.
